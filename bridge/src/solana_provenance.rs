//! `dregg-bridge::solana_provenance`: **bank-state provenance** for the trustless
//! Solana bridge — pass 3, the hardest leg.
//!
//! Passes 1–2 made the *consensus cryptography* ([`crate::solana_consensus`]) and
//! the *mainnet wire formats* ([`crate::solana_wire`]) real, but two inputs were
//! still **trusted**: the per-epoch [`EpochStakeTable`] (vote account → stake) and
//! the binding of each vote's signer to the vote account's on-chain authorized
//! voter. This module sources both **from Solana's own bank state**, verified
//! against the accounts hash the super-majority voted, rotated forward from an
//! irreducible weak-subjectivity anchor.
//!
//! # What becomes verified (no longer trusted)
//!
//! 1. **Stake table from bank state** ([`derive_stake_table`]). The active
//!    delegated stake per vote account is *derived* by proving the stake-program
//!    and vote-program accounts are included in the voted accounts hash (reusing
//!    pass-2's [`verify_account_inclusion_16ary`]) and decoding their account
//!    data: each stake account's [`Delegation`] (decoded from the mainnet
//!    `StakeStateV2` layout) contributes its active stake to its delegated vote
//!    account, and each vote account's `VoteState` (decoded with the type-only
//!    `solana-vote-interface`) yields the authorized voter for the epoch. The
//!    resulting [`EpochStakeTable`] is *proven from the bank hash the votes
//!    attest*, not supplied as trusted input.
//! 2. **Authorized-voter binding** ([`VerifiedStakeTable::tally_authorized`]).
//!    Each vote transaction (pass 2) designates a key as the vote authority and
//!    is signature-verified under it; here we additionally require that key to
//!    equal the vote account's on-chain `authorized_voter` for the epoch, decoded
//!    from the proven vote-account state. This closes pass-2's named gap — a
//!    relayer can no longer name an attacker key as authority.
//! 3. **Epoch rotation from a trusted anchor** ([`WeakSubjectivityAnchor`] +
//!    [`rotate`]). The anchor pins one `(epoch, stake_table_root)` checkpoint —
//!    the irreducible weak-subjectivity root every light client has. A later
//!    epoch's table is admitted only when it is (a) derived from bank state and
//!    (b) that bank state is attested by ≥ 2/3 of the *already-trusted* (anchor or
//!    previously-rotated) epoch's stake. Everything after the anchor is verified.
//!
//! # What pass 4 adds (the warmup/cooldown effective-stake curve)
//!
//! The stake summed per vote account is now Solana's **effective stake** — the
//! warmup/cooldown curve, not the coarse `[activation, deactivation)` integer
//! window. [`effective_stake`] runs Solana's own
//! `Delegation::stake_v2(target_epoch, &StakeHistory, new_rate_activation_epoch)`
//! (the upstream integer implementation, type-only `solana-stake-interface`) over
//! the cluster's [`StakeHistory`], so a delegation that is still warming up (or
//! cooling down) contributes its *rate-limited* effective stake, not its full
//! delegated amount. The per-epoch warmup/cooldown allowance is bounded by the
//! cluster rate (`ORIGINAL_WARMUP_COOLDOWN_RATE_BPS = 2_500` / 25%, then
//! `TOWER_WARMUP_COOLDOWN_RATE_BPS = 900` / 9% from the
//! `reduce_stake_warmup_cooldown` feature epoch — `new_rate_activation_epoch`).
//! The `StakeHistory` is itself **proven from the same bank state**: the
//! `SysvarStakeHistory1111111111111111111111111` sysvar account
//! ([`STAKE_HISTORY_SYSVAR_ID`]) is included in the voted accounts hash and
//! decoded ([`decode_stake_history`]), so the effective-stake denominator the
//! ≥ 2/3 super-majority is checked against is derived, not trusted.
//!
//! # What remains trusted (named precisely)
//!
//! - **The weak-subjectivity anchor itself** (`(epoch, stake_table_root)`). This
//!   is irreducible: a from-genesis-trustless Solana light client would have to
//!   replay all of history. Every deployed light client (ETH included) trusts a
//!   recent finalized checkpoint; this is dregg's.
//! - **The two-epoch leader-schedule snapshot offset.** The warmup/cooldown curve
//!   (the *magnitude* of each validator's stake) is now exact; which epoch index
//!   the consensus stake-weight snapshot is taken at (Solana's leader schedule is
//!   the stakes two epochs prior) is a ±1–2 epoch shift in the evaluation point,
//!   not the curve shape — evaluated here at the table's `epoch`.
//! - The **bank-hash version extras** and **account-data lock-record layout**
//!   named in `docs/deos/TRUSTLESS-SOLANA-BRIDGE.md` are unchanged by this pass.
