//! Full presentation builder.
//!
//! The presentation builder takes a plaintext token chain (a sequence of
//! attenuations) and produces a ZK-ready presentation proof. This is the
//! high-level API that orchestrates the entire pipeline:
//!
//! 1. Convert each token to a committed fact set.
//! 2. Compute fold deltas for each attenuation step.
//! 3. Evaluate the authorization request against the final state.
//! 4. Produce a circuit witness and generate the STARK proof.
//!
//! The resulting `BridgePresentationProof` can be verified without knowing
//! the token chain, capabilities, or any private data — only the public
//! inputs (federation root, request predicate, timestamp) are visible.
