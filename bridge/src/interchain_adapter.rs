//! `InterchainAdapter`: ONE abstraction over the four per-chain trust dials that
//! all feed the SAME committed mint gate ([`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor::bridge_mint_against_lock`]).
//!
//! Every inbound bridge leg answers two questions before it may mint:
//!
//! - **WHAT** is being minted — the `(nullifier, recipient, destination, amount)`
//!   tuple, carried by a [`PortableActionBinding`] whose IR-v2 proof algebraically
//!   attests those exact bytes.
//! - **HOW TRUSTED** is the evidence — a per-chain dial today spelled four
//!   different ways: Solana's [`LockProofTrust`], Ethereum's [`SnarkSystem`]
//!   (`is_snark_backed`), Midnight's optimistic-watchtower [`Verdict`], and a
//!   committee-finalized [`FinalizedAttestation`] quorum.
//!
//! This module collapses those four dials onto ONE ordinal, [`TrustRung`], with a
//! single fail-closed predicate, [`TrustRung::reached_consensus`], which becomes
//! [`BridgeMintRequest::consensus_verified`]. The gate itself is unchanged: it
//! refuses any request whose `consensus_verified` is `false`
//! ([`BridgeMintError::TrustTooLow`]). The point of the abstraction is that a
//! low-trust dial value (an RPC echo, an unresolved/fraudulent watchtower verdict,
//! a no-quorum committee) CANNOT reach `true` — the mapping is the only bridge
//! from a chain's raw evidence to the mint bool, and it is fail-closed by
//! construction.
//!
//! # The Nomad-law tooth
//!
//! The $190M Nomad hack accepted every unproven message because an uninitialized
//! slot defaulted to "accepted". Two independent teeth here refuse the
//! zero/default input BEFORE a mint request is ever built:
//!
//! 1. [`TrustRung::reached_consensus`] is `false` for [`TrustRung::Rpc`] — the
//!    rung a `StructureOnly` / bare-RPC dial maps to — and `false` for an
//!    unresolved watchtower or a zero-signer committee. The *default*/lowest-trust
//!    dial can never mint.
//! 2. [`InterchainAdapter::to_action_binding`] refuses a binding whose nullifier
//!    is the all-zero (uninitialized) value ([`AdapterError::EmptyAttestation`]),
//!    so an empty attestation cannot even produce a mint request.
