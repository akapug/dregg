//! Federation registry and issuer membership.
//!
//! A federation is a set of authorities that trust each other for cross-silo
//! authorization. The federation root is a BLAKE3 commitment to the set of
//! all member authorities' public keys.
//!
//! When a token crosses silo boundaries, the verifying silo checks that
//! the token's issuer is a member of the shared federation. This requires
//! only the federation root and the member list — no real-time communication
//! with the issuing silo.
//!
//! NOTE: This module is standalone for membership tracking and role-based access.
//! The real `pyana_federation` crate provides attested roots with quorum
//! certificates and Merkle-based revocation (live BFT consensus itself lives
//! in `pyana_blocklace`); those features are exercised via `revocation.rs`
//! (RevocationTree) and `main.rs` (STARK proof of issuer membership).
//!
//! // TODO: integrate with real pyana_federation::node::Federation for full consensus-
//! // based membership attestation (AttestedRoot with quorum signatures over the
//! // member set). Currently membership is checked via a simple HashMap lookup.
