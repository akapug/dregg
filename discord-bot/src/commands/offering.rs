//! **The generic DreggNet-offering → Discord adapter.**
//!
//! `/dungeon` (`commands::fiction`) proved one offering can be played in Discord. This module
//! is the *shape* of that proof, extracted: ANY [`dreggnet_offerings::Offering`] —
//! [`dreggnet_council::CouncilOffering`], [`dreggnet_market::MarketOffering`], a hosted-Hermes
//! or grain offering later — becomes a Discord command surface by implementing
//! [`DiscordOffering`] (a key, a title, a session store, and which turns take a typed value).
//!
//! The bot is the offering core's **Discord `Frontend`** in the sense
//! `dreggnet_offerings`'s doc names:
//!
//! * **present** — an offering's [`Offering::render`] returns a deos [`Surface`] (a
//!   `deos_view::ViewNode`). We paint it through the SAME `deos_view::discord` backend the
//!   desktop/web/seL4 renderers are peers of ([`embed_of`]) — the card is authored once by the
//!   offering and rendered by the platform. We keep only the *embed* from that render and mint
//!   the *components* ourselves ([`action_rows`]) from the typed [`Offering::actions`], because
//!   a Discord custom-id must carry **which offering** the press belongs to (`deos_view`'s
//!   `deosturn:<turn>:<arg>` id is already the `viewnode_applet` card route) and because some
//!   affordances need a **typed value** the user supplies in a modal.
//! * **collect** — a press decodes back into the typed `(SessionId, Action, DreggIdentity)`:
//!   [`parse_press`] → [`drive`] / [`drive_value`].
//! * **the actor is a real dregg identity** — never a Discord nickname. The presser's
//!   [`DreggIdentity`] is their derived Ed25519 public key hex
//!   (`UserCipherclerk::derive(bot_secret, user_id, federation)`), exactly as `/dungeon`'s
//!   ballots are attributed ([`identity_of`]).
//! * **the executor is the sole referee** — a press is ONE [`Offering::advance`]: a legal move
//!   lands a real `TurnReceipt` ([`Outcome::Landed`]), an illegal/ineligible/forged one is a
//!   real [`Outcome::Refused`] that commits nothing. A currently-ineligible affordance is
//!   rendered **locked but still pressable** (`🔒`, danger-styled) — the cap tooth is *shown,
//!   not hidden*, and pressing it surfaces the executor's own refusal honestly, rather than the
//!   frontend pretending to be the gate.
//!
//! ## The custom-id wire
//!
//! | id                                | meaning                                            |
//! |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `offering:fire:<key>:<turn>:<arg>`| press → one `advance(Action{turn,arg}, actor)`      |
//! | `offering:ask:<key>:<turn>`       | press → open a modal for the turn's typed value     |
//! | `offering:submit:<key>:<turn>`    | the modal's submit → `advance` with the typed value |
//!
//! `<key>` is [`DiscordOffering::KEY`] (`council`, `market`, …) — the router in `main.rs` sends
//! every `offering:` press here, and [`route_component`] / [`route_modal`] dispatch on the key.
//!
//! ## What is logic-driven vs what needs a live Discord token
//!
//! [`drive`] / [`drive_value`] are the **sync core** of a press: decode the custom-id, resolve
//! the actor, run the real offering turn, hand back the [`Outcome`]. The async handlers
//! ([`handle_component`], [`handle_modal`], [`handle_status`], [`handle_verify`]) are thin
//! serenity wrappers around them. So the tests drive the SAME path a live button press takes —
//! only the HTTP round-trip to Discord is absent.
