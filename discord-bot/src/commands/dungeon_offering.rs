//! **The `/dungeon` adoption of the generic collective adapter (CONSERVATIVE).**
//!
//! `/dungeon` (`crate::commands::fiction`) still owns the LIVE Discord surface — its bespoke
//! ballot embeds, the per-run thread orchestration, and above all the paid narrator credit gate
//! (`narrate_room_gated`, a real Bedrock spend). That flow is intact and untouched.
//!
//! What this module adds is the proof — and the reachable capability — that the dungeon is ALSO a
//! first-class consumer of the generic [`crate::commands::offering`] adapter's **collective
//! mode**: [`dreggnet_offerings::dungeon::DungeonOffering`] runs through the SAME
//! [`CollectiveRound`](crate::commands::offering::CollectiveRound) → write-once ballots →
//! plurality → [`Offering::advance_collective`] path any collective offering does. The dungeon is
//! [`DiscordOffering::collective`] (its presses tally rather than fire immediately), and a round
//! close resolves the crowd's plurality winner as ONE real cap-bounded turn carrying the whole
//! `CollectiveDecision` (the electorate + the tally + the carrier) — closing the gap the
//! `/dungeon` frontend flagged, where the crowd turn was attributed to a nameless `party_actor()`
//! constant rather than the real voters.
//!
//! ## What is migrated vs precisely named
//!
//! MIGRATED (here, driven): the dungeon's ballot mechanism — write-once per derived dregg
//! identity, plurality winner, the crowd turn as `advance_collective` — is the generic adapter's
//! collective mode, exercised end-to-end against the real Warden's Keep world-cell.
//!
//! NAMED (the precise remaining cutover, deliberately NOT done to keep the paid `/dungeon` flow
//! unbroken): `fiction.rs`'s live handlers would delegate to the collective core —
//! `handle_component` → [`cast_vote`](crate::commands::offering::cast_vote), `handle_close` →
//! [`close_round`](crate::commands::offering::close_round) — with `narrate_room_gated` invoked in
//! the async layer AFTER `close_round` returns the next round's actions (the narrator gate is a
//! frontend concern the offering core deliberately does not carry). That swap is mechanical but
//! touches the thread-spin orchestration + the Bedrock spend path, so it is staged behind this
//! driven proof rather than risked in the same breath.
