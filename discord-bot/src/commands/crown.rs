//! 👑 `/crown` — **fold a finished match to ONE proof: prove you won without revealing how.**
//!
//! THE CROWN, wired. A finished `/play tug` or `/play automatafl` match — every turn of it a
//! real committed executor turn — FOLDS, in the background, into ONE succinct
//! `WholeChainProof`, and that proof (never the moves) is submitted to the proof-carrying
//! game board:
//!
//! ```text
//!   PLAY (Discord, fast)      PROVE (background, minutes)      SUBMIT (a proof, not moves)
//!   ────────────────────      ───────────────────────────      ───────────────────────────
//!   /play tug|automatafl  ─▶  dreggnet_prove_service        ─▶ dreggnet_game_board::GameBoard
//!   a win lands           👑  ::enqueue → the deployed          ::submit — verified in O(1),
//!   "Fold this match"         recursive STARK fold              ranked, has_moves() == false
//! ```
//!
//! * **the fold is real and slow** — [`dreggnet_prove_service::MatchProveService`] runs the
//!   deployed recursion (`prove_turn_chain_recursive`) on a bounded worker pool, OFF the
//!   interaction path. The player gets an honest "proving in the background (minutes)" status
//!   they poll; nothing spins, nothing pretends.
//! * **the board stores NO moves** — an accepted entry is the proof envelope + the attested
//!   publics ([`ugc_dregg`] proof path). For a tug match the fold's leaves are Poseidon2
//!   membership proofs whose public inputs are `[blinded_leaf, hand_root]` — the winner's
//!   card ids are in NOBODY's hands but their own.
//! * **any stranger re-verifies in O(1)** — the proof envelope is attached to the ranked post
//!   as a file, and a **Re-verify** button lets ANY user watch this bot re-run the whole-history
//!   light client against the pinned anchor: one check, zero replay, zero trust in the winner
//!   — or in this bot.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! * The deployed STARK is *succinct*, not *hiding*: "moves never posted" is a
//!   data-availability privacy property (the board never sees them, nobody publishes them),
//!   NOT a crypto-ZK claim about the transcript. The footer says so.
//! * The **tug** fold consumes the winner's real private match record (dealt hand + ordered
//!   plays + the terminal win), read through `TugSession`'s owner-facing match-record seam.
//! * The **automatafl** fold is the game crate's own named scope: the committed D1
//!   automaton-step chain (as many turns as the match resolved, stepping from the final
//!   committed position) — the player-move D2/D3 stages fold identically but are not the
//!   chain driven here ([`dreggnet_game_board`]'s named residual, repeated in the post).
//! * The board + fold records live in this process (an in-memory `GameBoard`), like the other
//!   offering sessions; a restart forgets pending folds. The proof FILE survives on Discord —
//!   and stays verifiable by anyone holding the anchor.
//!
//! ## The custom-id wire
//!
//! | id                       | meaning                                                    |
