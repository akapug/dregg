//! `/play <offering>` — **the full-portfolio reach**: the twelve DreggNet Cloud offerings that did
//! NOT yet have a bespoke Discord slash command, mounted through the SAME generic
//! [`crate::commands::offering`] adapter as `/council` / `/market` / `/doc`, so Discord reaches
//! offering parity with the web catalog ([`dreggnet_web::demo_host`]).
//!
//! Before this module Discord served six of the eighteen portfolio offerings (dungeon, council,
//! market, hermes, grain, doc). This adds the rest via one uniform `/play` command:
//!
//! * **the two portfolio games** — `automatafl` (the simultaneous-move board) and `tug`
//!   (multiway-tug, wrapped in the seat-claiming [`SeatedTug`] adapter — the ONE shared
//!   `dreggnet_catalog::seated` copy every frontend uses — so a Discord user's derived identity
//!   can claim a seat and see their OWN hidden hand through the viewer-aware render path);
//! * **the two remaining non-game offerings** — `names` and `compute`;
//! * **the eight do-once RPG feature surfaces** — `trade`, `inventory`, `cheevos`, `guild`, `craft`,
//!   `companion`, `tavern`, `party` (`dreggnet-surfaces`).
//!
//! Each `impl`s [`Offering`], so it becomes a Discord surface through the generic adapter with no
//! per-offering rendering code: its deos `ViewNode` render is the embed, its cap-gated `Action`s are
//! the buttons, a press is ONE real `advance` attributed to the presser's derived dregg identity, and
//! the press re-render is projected FOR the presser ([`crate::commands::offering::surface_for`]).
//!
//! ROUTING: the eight RPG feature-surface keys open in the invoker's **per-identity persistent
//! world** ([`crate::commands::rpg_world`]) — one `OfferingHost` per derived dregg identity,
//! mounted via `dreggnet_surfaces::register_surfaces` (ONE shared world across craft/inventory/
//! trade, so a forged item IS in your inventory IS tradeable), sqlite-persisted by replay, with
//! the player's REAL earned cheevos. The four remaining keys (the two games + names/compute)
//! keep the per-channel generic-adapter stores below. A board offering (automatafl, tug) is a
//! `CoordGrid` that the Discord card renderer paints in full (the most complete renderer of the
//! three chat surfaces).
