//! `/gallery` — the **universe gallery**, wired to the REAL [`ugc_dregg`] registry.
//!
//! This command used to browse "devnet artworks" through four `DevnetClient` calls that
//! every one of them returned [`DevnetError::Unsupported`](crate::devnet::DevnetError)
//! ("not exposed by the current public node API") — a complete UI over four dead stubs,
//! which rendered as "Gallery Unavailable" every single time. The gallery is now the
//! thing dregg actually has: a gallery of **authored universes** on `ugc-dregg`'s real
//! registry + its **no-cheat verifiable leaderboard**.
//!
//! ## The four verbs
//!
//! | subcommand | what it really does |
//! |------------|---------------------|
//! | `list`     | every published [`Universe`] in the registry (name / author / content address) |
//! | `show`     | one universe + its **leaderboard**: verified completions, ranked by turns-to-win |
//! | `publish`  | mints a REAL procgen universe from a committed seed ([`Universe::daily`]) and publishes it — content-addressed, winnable, re-generable byte-for-byte from its seed |
//! | `play`     | submits a run: the moves are re-executed against a FRESH identically-seeded world; only a completion that **provably reaches the win** is accepted + ranked |
//!
//! ## The no-cheat tooth reaches Discord
//!
//! `play` does not trust the player. [`Registry::submit`] re-drives the submitted moves
//! through the real executor on a fresh world and requires the recorded receipt chain
//! re-verifies to the universe's declared WIN state, with a truthful turn count. A forged
//! or incomplete run is REJECTED — and the embed says *why* ([`RejectReason`] is surfaced
//! verbatim, not swallowed). The old `/gallery bid` signing path is repurposed: the
//! player's cipherclerk now signs their submitted run, binding the completion to their
//! custodial identity (see [`sign_run`]).
//!
//! ## Persistence — DURABLE, with boot-time re-verification
//!
//! The live [`Registry`] is still the process-wide `OnceLock<Mutex<Registry>>` cache, but
//! it is now **backed by a durable [`GalleryStore`]**. A published universe's *public
//! source* (name / author / seed-epoch / win) and a submitted completion's *moves +
//! player + claimed turns* are written to the store; on boot [`load_registry`] reads them
//! back and **replays each one through [`Registry::publish`] / [`Registry::submit`]** —
//! which RE-VERIFIES every completion by replay against a fresh, identically-seeded world.
//!
//! Only the minimal, reproducible input is stored — a universe's seed-epoch (not a cached
//! world), a completion's *move sequence* (not a trusted receipt blob). The receipt chain
//! is deterministically re-recorded and re-checked at load, so **a tampered DB row cannot
//! resurrect a cheat**: edit the moves to a non-winning line and the no-cheat gate rejects
//! it (`DidNotWin` / a refused move); edit `claimed_turns` and it rejects (`ResultMismatch`);
//! edit a universe's source/author/epoch and its recomputed content address no longer
//! matches its stored id, so the row is dropped. None of these land on the board.
//!
//! The main loop wires a sqlite [`GalleryStore`] to the bot `Database` (see the wiring note
//! below); tests here drive the whole persist → reload → re-verify cycle against the
//! [`InMemoryGalleryStore`], including the tampered-row rejections.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! * **Auctions are gone, not stubbed.** `ugc-dregg` has no auction/bid concept, so
//!   `auctions`/`mybids` are NOT carried forward as dead UI. The bidding *machinery*
//!   (cclerk signing) is repurposed onto `play`, which is a real submission.
//! * **Author identity** is a *name*, not a verified signing key (ugc-dregg's own named
//!   gap). The `play` signature binds the *player*; the *author* string is still trusted.
//
// ─── MAIN-LOOP WIRING (what closes the loop; NOT owned by this file) ─────────────
// This module OWNS the `GalleryStore` trait, its `InMemoryGalleryStore` (tests), and the
// boot-replay-reverify (`load_registry`). The main loop wires the persistent backing:
//
//   1. `migrations/005_ugc_gallery.sql` — the two tables (`ugc_universes`,
//      `ugc_completions`). Add the matching inline `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to
//      `Database::connect` (the bot's schema-in-code pattern), and four `Database`
//      methods: `persist_ugc_universe(..)`, `persist_ugc_completion(..)` (both
//      `INSERT OR IGNORE` on the PK), `list_ugc_universes()`, `list_ugc_completions()`.
//   2. A bot-owned `SqliteGalleryStore` implementing `gallery::GalleryStore` over the
//      async `Database` — exactly like `pay::SqliteCreditStore` (sync trait, drives each
//      async query with `tokio::task::block_in_place`). Its four methods map to the four
//      `Database` methods above and translate rows to/from `StoredUniverse` /
//      `StoredCompletion`.
//   3. At boot, ONE call: `gallery::install_store(Box::new(SqliteGalleryStore::new(db, handle)))`.
//      `install_store` records the store AND loads+re-verifies the live registry from it.
//      No `BotState` field is needed — the store is held in this module's `OnceLock`, and
//      the handlers persist through it after each successful publish / play.
