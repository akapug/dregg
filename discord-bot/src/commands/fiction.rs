//! `/dungeon` — a whole Discord channel plays a shared, AI-narrated dungeon on the
//! **REAL dregg executor**.
//!
//! The play path is [`dungeon_on_dregg`]'s committed universe — "The Warden's Keep" —
//! hosted on [`spween_dregg`]'s real [`WorldCell`]: the same `EmbeddedExecutor`, cell,
//! `CellProgram` and [`TurnReceipt`] the flagship substrate uses, NOT `attested-dm`'s
//! toy `WorldCell`/blake3 ledger. What the party pays for and plays is verifiable
//! substrate, not a LARP hash-chain.
//!
//! ## The ballot runs through the GENERIC collective adapter
//!
//! `/dungeon`'s write-once ballot is no longer a bespoke mechanism living here — it is the
//! generic [`crate::commands::offering`] adapter's **collective mode**, driven against the
//! real [`DungeonOffering`] (which is [`crate::commands::offering::DiscordOffering`], see
//! `crate::commands::dungeon_offering`). The offering session (world-cell + receipt chain)
//! and the live [`CollectiveRound`] both live in the adapter's per-offering
//! [`Store`](crate::commands::offering::Store); a button press records a write-once ballot in
//! that round (the mechanism [`cast_vote`](crate::commands::offering::cast_vote) wraps), and
//! `/dungeon close` resolves the plurality winner through
//! [`close_round`](crate::commands::offering::close_round) → `Offering::advance_collective`:
//! ONE real cap-bounded turn carrying the whole `CollectiveDecision` (the real electorate +
//! the tally + the "party" carrier). A legal move lands a real [`TurnReceipt`]; an illegal one
//! — a move the executor's installed `StateConstraint` refuses (a killing blow past the HP
//! floor, a second grab of a `WriteOnce` relic, an over-budget ward, a climb up a one-way
//! stair) — is a real refusal: the crowd decided, the world disposed, nothing commits, no
//! receipt (the anti-ghost tooth). `/dungeon verify` re-verifies the whole receipt chain by
//! REPLAY, through the offering's own `verify`.
//!
//! ## What stays HERE (the frontend the offering core deliberately does not carry)
//!
//! The bot owns the LIVE Discord surface — the rich ballot embeds, the per-run thread
//! orchestration, and the **paid narrator credit gate** ([`narrate_room_gated`], a real
//! Bedrock spend debited exactly once after a successful hosted call, with the free-tier
//! gemma/scripted fallback). That flow is intact and byte-identical; narration is invoked in
//! the async layer AFTER the round resolves and the next room's state is in hand. A thin
//! per-channel [`DungeonMeta`] map holds only what the collective adapter's `Live` does not:
//! how the current room was narrated, the last narration text (so a vote re-render never
//! re-hits the network), and the orchestrated-thread key to tear down at run end.
//!
//! The executor is the SOURCE OF TRUTH: the AI narrates, the world resolves, the chain
//! remembers. A jailbroken narration cannot open a gated stair or mint an unearned relic —
//! only a move the verified executor admits ever changes the world.
