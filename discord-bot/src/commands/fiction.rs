//! `/dungeon` — a whole Discord channel plays a shared, AI-narrated dungeon on the
//! **REAL dregg executor**.
//!
//! The play path is [`dungeon_on_dregg`]'s committed universe — "The Warden's Keep" —
//! hosted on [`spween_dregg`]'s real [`WorldCell`]: the same `EmbeddedExecutor`, cell,
//! `CellProgram` and [`TurnReceipt`] the flagship substrate uses, NOT `attested-dm`'s
//! toy `WorldCell`/blake3 ledger. What the party pays for and plays is verifiable
//! substrate, not a LARP hash-chain.
//!
//! A channel opens a session, the bot posts the room (Bedrock/gemma narrates it, the
//! scene describes it) with a row of **buttons for the candidate moves**, and every
//! button press is a **ballot** — one write-once vote per Discord user per round,
//! attributed not to a nickname but to that user's derived **dregg identity**
//! (`cipherclerk::UserCipherclerk::derive(...).public_key_hex()`). When the round closes,
//! the **plurality winner** is applied as ONE real cap-bounded turn
//! ([`WorldCell::apply_choice`]): a legal move lands a real [`TurnReceipt`] (the receipt
//! chain grows); an illegal one — a move the executor's installed `StateConstraint`
//! refuses (a killing blow past the HP floor, a second grab of a `WriteOnce` relic, an
//! over-budget ward, a climb up a one-way stair) — is a real [`WorldError::Refused`]:
//! the crowd decided, the world disposed, nothing commits, no receipt (the anti-ghost
//! tooth). `/dungeon verify` re-verifies the whole receipt chain by REPLAY
//! ([`spween_dregg::verify_by_replay`]) — re-driving a fresh, identically-seeded
//! world-cell through the recorded choices and confirming it reproduces exactly the
//! committed state chain. A forged/reordered record fails.
//!
//! The executor is the SOURCE OF TRUTH: the AI narrates, the world resolves, the chain
//! remembers. A jailbroken narration cannot open a gated stair or mint an unearned
//! relic — only a move the verified executor admits ever changes the world.

// ORCHESTRATION SEAM (documented, deliberately NOT wired here). `state.orchestrator`

// thread for a dungeon session — gated, category-filed, queue-linked, and fully torn down
// (with every capability cell revoked) at the end. The wiring would be, at session open:
//
//     let spec = orchestration::SessionSpec::new("dungeon", session_id, guild_id,
//             command.user.id.get(), command.user.id.get())

//     // ...run in live.channel_id...
//
// and at `/dungeon close`: `state.orchestrator.teardown(&spec.key(), ..).await`.
//
// It is NOT wired into THIS handler because `/dungeon` is intentionally an IN-CHANNEL
// experience: a session is keyed by the channel the command was issued in (`sessions()`),
// and the whole run — narration, ballots, `/dungeon close` — happens inline there. Making
// `/dungeon start` mint a fresh channel instead would be a UX change (and needs
// MANAGE_CHANNELS + an owning guild), so it stays behind this seam. The bootstrap half IS
// live (see `guild_create` in `main.rs`): the offering category is prepared per guild, so
// a future channel-spun `/dungeon` mode files under a category that already exists.
// TODO(offering-sessions): add a `/dungeon start --private` (or a distinct offering) that
