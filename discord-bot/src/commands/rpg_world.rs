//! **The per-identity PERSISTENT RPG world** behind `/play trade|craft|inventory|guild|cheevos|
//! companion|tavern|party` — the fix for the audit's biggest depth failure (backlog #15, folding
//! in #24).
//!
//! Before this module those eight `/play` keys each opened a THROWAWAY demo world
//! (`SharedWorld::demo("Adventurer")`, `CheevoShowcase::demo()`): canned stock, forgotten on
//! restart, and — the deepest cut — **no composition**: trade, craft and inventory each stood on
//! their own private ledger, so a forged Greatblade was not in your inventory and not listable.
//!
//! This module mounts, for **each player's derived dregg identity**, one persistent
//! [`OfferingHost`] built by [`dreggnet_surfaces::register_surfaces`] — the SAME one-call
//! registration the web catalog uses, which mounts trade + craft + inventory onto **ONE
//! [`SharedWorld`](dreggnet_surfaces::SharedWorld)** (one `AssetWorld`, one item registry). So on
//! Discord, as on the web: forge a Greatblade on the craft surface and it IS in your inventory
//! and IS listable on your trade stall, as the same note-cell (the `dreggnet-saga` composition).
//!
//! ## Persistence — replay, never a state blob
//!
//! Each player's host writes through a [`SqliteRpgResumeStore`] (`rpg_store`, the durable sqlite
//! impl the core resume seam names as the bot's follow-up): every session open (its seed) and
//! every LANDED advance persists as reproducible public input. On the player's first touch after
//! a restart the host is rebuilt by REPLAYING those logs through the real executor
//! ([`OfferingHost::resume`]) — a tampered log is refused on re-drive and fails closed, never
//! reopened to a forged state.
//!
//! Because craft / inventory / trade share ONE world, the replay order across their per-session
//! logs matters (a crafted note must exist before its listing re-drives). [`order_logs_for_replay`]
//! replays **craft first** (the only surface that MINTS into the shared ledger), then the movers.
//! Residual (named): the exact cross-session interleaving is not recorded, so an exotic
//! interleave two lanes both touching one note in opposite order could re-drive to a refusal —
//! the session then honestly fails to reopen (its log is kept; nothing forged goes live).
//!
//! ## Real earned cheevos (#24)
//!
//! The `cheevos` key no longer shows `CheevoShowcase::demo()` (Ada's museum). At host build the
//! player's OWN persisted `/descent` board completions (the no-cheat store `descent_completions`)
//! are replayed and fed to [`CheevoLedger::earn`] — the full gate: re-execute the run against the
//! regenerated day-world, then hold the achievement predicate over the run's REAL committed
//! trajectory. A player who has cleared nothing sees an honest empty showcase; nothing is
//! inherited from a demo fixture.
//!
//! ## Identity semantics
//!
//! The world is **yours**: `/play craft` opens YOUR forge in any channel, and a button press on
//! any rendered surface acts in the PRESSER's own world (the embed re-renders as theirs). The
//! canned trade counterparty ("buyer" and its purse) is part of the seeded single-player world —
//! cross-player trading is a named next step, not faked here.
