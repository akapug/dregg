//! `/descent` — THE DESCENT played LIVE in Discord: today's beacon-seeded, permadeath
//! procgen roguelite over the committed [`DailyDescentOffering`].
//!
//! This is the flagship's earning core (docs/GAME-STRATEGY.md Phase 1) made playable in the bot.
//! It drives the SAME committed
//! [`dreggnet_offerings::daily_descent::DailyDescentOffering`] the crate's own driven test does —
//! nothing is re-implemented here; the bot is a live *surface* over the real substrate:
//!
//! 1. **Today's beacon-seeded world.** [`resolve_todays_beacon`] pins a REAL published drand
//!    `quicknet` round (the committed beacon path); the day's [`CommittedSeed`] is
//!    [`DailyBeacon::seed`] (a BLS-pairing-verified fold of the round output). Everyone who plays
//!    "today" gets the byte-identical dungeon; a different day's verified round gives a different
//!    world (proven at the scene level in the tests). *A live drand HTTP fetch that advances the
//!    round each real day is the NAMED seam* — here we play the pinned round as today's beacon.
//! 2. **A permadeath run on the real executor.** Each move is one cap-bounded turn the verified
//!    executor admits (a real [`TurnReceipt`]); a blow you could not survive is REFUSED
//!    (`FieldGte(hp,1)`); a reckless line falls into a committed DEFEAT passage — a run can be
//!    genuinely LOST, and (hardcore) the persistent character PERISHES, `WriteOnce`-final.
//! 3. **A persistent, carrying character.** Level / class / earned XP / a hardcore death carry
//!    across days through the durable [`crate::character_store::SqliteCharacterStore`], keyed by
//!    the player's derived dregg identity (the SAME identity `/dungeon` attributes ballots to).
//! 4. **A no-cheat leaderboard.** A WON run publishes today's world as a
//!    [`ugc_dregg::Universe`] and submits a [`ugc_dregg::Completion`] the board accepts ONLY if it
//!    re-executes to the WIN on a stranger's re-execution — a forged / lost / incomplete run is
//!    refused ([`Registry::submit`]).
//!
//! ## What is live here vs the named seams
//! - **Live:** the daily offering, permadeath, the carrying character, the no-cheat board (now
//!   DURABLE — see below), and the paid/free AI narrator (the same `$DREGG` credit gate `/dungeon`
//!   uses, [`crate::pay`]).
//! - **Durable board.** The leaderboard is no longer in-process only: it is backed by a
//!   [`DescentBoardStore`] (a sqlite impl wired at boot). Only the reproducible PUBLIC input is
//!   persisted — a day-world's committed beacon SEED (never a cached world) and a winning run's
//!   MOVE SEQUENCE + player + claimed turns (never a trusted receipt blob). On boot [`load_board`]
//!   regenerates each day-world from its seed and REPLAYS every completion through the real no-cheat
//!   gate, so a tampered row (a losing move line, a lied turn count, a mismatched seed) cannot
//!   resurrect a cheat. A verified win survives restart and still ranks. The character store owns
//!   the meta-currency (echoes/boon) durably; the [`OfferingHost`] SESSIONS remain in-process (a
//!   named seam — see [`crate::commands::offering`]).
//! - **Named seams:** the live drand HTTP fetch (advancing the round each real UTC day — here a
//!   pinned round); the midnight cron / `RevealReactor` auto-reveal (here a manual `/descent play`
//!   or scheduled trigger); the web spectator page (a separate lane).
//!
//! [`OfferingHost`]: dreggnet_offerings::host::OfferingHost
//!
//! ## Threading
//! A live [`DailyRun`] holds `spween_dregg::WorldCell`s whose installed `Mandate`s are not `Send`
//! (the same reason [`crate::commands::offering::Store`] pins its sessions to a dedicated thread).
//! So the per-player runs + the in-process leaderboard live on ONE dedicated
//! [`DescentStore`] thread, driven by `Send` jobs that return `Send` snapshots; the async narrator
//! network call happens OFF that thread (on the Discord worker), exactly as `/dungeon` narrates
//! after a round resolves.
