//! # The discord-bot AS a SERVICE CELL on the `invoke()` front door.
//!
//! This is the bot's modern service-cell face: its command surface published as a
//! first-class, typed, content-addressed [`InterfaceDescriptor`] whose methods are
//! driven through the [`dregg_app_framework::invoke`] front door — the userspace
//! method-dispatch layer that lives *slightly above* the effect-VM and desugars a
//! method call to the ordinary verified effects it names. There is **no
//! `Effect::Invoke`**, no kernel change, no new circuit rung: the kernel and the
//! light client keep seeing only the `SetField`/`EmitEvent` effects they already
//! enforce and witness. The one extra fact — that an invoked method is a member of
//! the bot's interface — is decided by the SAME verified DFA router
//! ([`InterfaceDescriptor::route_method`]) the protocol already uses, exactly as in
//! the `starbridge-kvstore` / `starbridge-nameservice` citizens.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Historically the bot's commands were a bespoke integration: per-command code
//! that hand-built a canonical `Action` (via the starbridge `build_*_action`
//! helpers) and pushed it down a custodial submit path, OR — for the older
//! surfaces — signed a legacy BLAKE3-MAC and POSTed it to a devnet HTTP endpoint.
//! Neither shape made the bot a *typed cap-gated dregg method* a light client or
//! the Service Explorer could enumerate. This module gives the bot the same shape
//! every other citizen has: ONE published [`InterfaceDescriptor`], routed through
//! `invoke()`.
//!
//! The bot's existing `build_*_action` helpers ALREADY target named methods —
//! `cclerk.make_action(cell, "register_name", effects)`,
//! `"issue_credential"`, `"propose_table_update"`, … — so the modernization is not
//! a rewrite of effect construction: it is *routing those same actions through the
//! published, typed, cap-gated interface*. [`BotService::invoke_built_action`] is
//! that bridge — it takes a canonical [`Action`] a `build_*_action` produced and
//! re-expresses its `args`+`effects` through the verified DFA + cap-gate of the
//! published interface, returning the ordinary signed [`Turn`].
//!
//! ## The published interface
//!
//! | method                 | semantics    | auth        | desugars to / status |
//! |------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
//! | `issue_credential`     | Replayable   | `Signature` | issuer-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `revoke_credential`    | Replayable   | `Signature` | issuer-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `register_name`        | Replayable   | `Signature` | registry-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `set_name_target`      | Replayable   | `Signature` | registry-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `propose_table_update` | Replayable   | `Signature` | namespace-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `vote_on_proposal`     | Replayable   | `Signature` | namespace-cell `SetField`+`EmitEvent` (canonical) |
//! | `gallery_bid`          | Replayable   | `Signature` | auction-cell mutation (the BESPOKE REMAINDER — still rides the legacy BLAKE3-MAC HTTP path; typed here so the explorer sees it) |
//! | `resolve_name`         | Serviced     | `None`      | — the OFE read seam (`crossCellRead_refines_observedField`) |
//! | `gallery_view`         | Serviced     | `None`      | — a read of the gallery's committed state |
//! | `attest_presence`      | Serviced     | `None`      | — the bot-signed presence attestation rides OUTSIDE the turn replay (a bot-issued MAC, named honestly as a seam) |
//!
//! The mutators are **replayable**: routed through `invoke()` they desugar to a
//! verified turn whose post-state the executor checks. The reads are **serviced**:
//! their answer rides the OFE cross-cell-read, not a replay — so `invoke()` refuses
//! to desugar them, naming the seam honestly rather than faking a write.
//!
//! ## The cap-gate (enforced twice over)
//!
//! Every mutator declares [`AuthRequired::Signature`]. The gate bites at the
//! `invoke()` front door (a caller presenting only [`InvokeAuthority::None`] is
//! refused before any turn is built) AND again by the executor (the desugared turn
//! carries a real `AppCipherclerk` signature the kernel verifies). The bot's
//! per-user custodial cipherclerk can always produce a `Signature`, so live
//! commands invoke with [`InvokeAuthority::Signature`].
