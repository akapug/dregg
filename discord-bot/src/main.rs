//! dregg Discord Bot — custodial-cclerk front-end to the dregg devnet.
//!
//! Lives at the workspace toplevel `/discord-bot` (peer of `node`, `sdk`,
//! `app-framework`) rather than under `apps/`. Per-user cipherclerks are
//! handles to `dregg_app_framework::AppCipherclerk` — the canonical narrow
//! SDK surface — derived deterministically from the bot's secret and
//! Discord user id.
//!
//! The global slash surface is the CURATED one — `commands::menus::SLASH_SURFACE` is the
//! single list, and `global_commands()` is its advertised rows. Every former flat command
//! (cclerk management, transfers, gallery, credentials, block-explorer browsing, presence
//! attestation, CapTP, governance, name service, federation linking, the games…) folds
//! behind one of them as a subcommand with its old options intact or as a menu button, on
//! its unchanged handler.
//!
//! ⚑ The un-advertised rows (`commands::menus::lab_commands()`) keep their modules, their
//! handlers and their router arms below; they are simply not in the global PUT. Set
//! `DREGG_LAB_GUILD_ID` to register them inside one guild — `ready()` names every one of
//! them at boot either way, so this is never a silent subtraction.
