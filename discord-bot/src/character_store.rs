//! The sqlite-backed [`SqliteCharacterStore`] — the durable backing of dreggnet-offerings'
//! [`CharacterStore`] seam, so a player's LEVELING character survives a process restart, not
//! just an in-session run.
//!
//! `dreggnet_offerings::character` OWNS the [`CharacterStore`] trait + the [`CharacterSheet`]
//! value + the [`AdventurerOffering`] that binds a character to a run; [`InMemoryCharacterStore`]
//! is the in-process impl its tests drive. This module supplies the ONE thing the bot owes it: a
//! durable impl. It is the exact shape of [`crate::pay::SqliteCreditStore`] /
//! [`crate::gallery_store::SqliteGalleryStore`] — the trait is SYNC (`&self` load / `&mut self`
//! save), but the bot's `Database` is async sqlx, so each method drives its async query to
//! completion with [`tokio::task::block_in_place`] on the current multi-thread runtime (no
//! nested-runtime panic, no deadlock), falling back to a stored [`tokio::runtime::Handle`] when
//! called from outside a runtime worker (e.g. a `spawn_blocking` thread).
//!
//! ## What persists, and the fail-safe
//!
//! The persisted state is the [`CharacterSheet`] keyed by the player's stable dregg identity hex:
//! `xp` / `level` / `class` / `abilities_used`. A **tampered or absent row fails safe** — a loaded
//! sheet is validated against the REAL progression curve ([`sheet_is_wellformed`]:
//! `xp >= xp_threshold(level)`, a valid class, `level <= MAX_LEVEL`), so a row that claims a level
//! its XP never earned loads as a **fresh level-1 character**, never a forged level. XP itself is
//! never bumped here — it flows through the real gated character turn ([`award_run_outcome`]).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - What persists: the four progression slots by identity. A fuller RPG persistence (inventory,
//!   reputation, a cross-universe character, a recorded + replay-verified character-turn chain)
//!   builds ON this seam — named, not built here.
//! - The collective `/dungeon` earns XP + levels a character on real party outcomes; a class is
//!   `WriteOnce` in the character cell and persists faithfully, but no Discord class-choice UI is
//!   wired yet (a collective player stays "unclassed" until that lands).
