//! Discord roles as dregg capabilities — the native-Discord deepening of the cap system.
//!
//! Two directions, and one honest boundary between them.
//!
//! **Role → cap (a gate).** A guild role is a fact Discord already tracks about a
//! member. This module maps a role id to a [`DreggCap`] TAG, so an offering or a
//! command can gate a slot on "does this member hold cap X?" without inventing its
//! own membership store. [`RoleCapMap::caps_for_roles`] reads the invoking member's
//! [`serenity::all::Member::roles`] and yields the caps those roles stand for; a
//! caller gates with [`RoleCapMap::holds`]. This is a *convenience* gate — a
//! locked-but-pressable slot (the same posture `dreggnet_offerings::Action::enabled`
//! takes: the tooth is *shown, not hidden*, and it is only a decoration).
//!
//! **Proof → role (a grant).** When a member earns something the server can verify
//! — tops the Descent board, completes `/credential verify` — the mapped role is
//! assigned via the Discord API ([`grant_cap_role`], which calls
//! [`serenity::all::Member::add_role`] exactly as
//! [`crate::discord_caps::DiscordCapability::AssignRole`] does). The bot needs the
//! **Manage Roles** guild permission to do this; without it the grant returns a
//! clear [`GrantOutcome::MissingManageRoles`], never a panic. The grant is
//! idempotent: a member who already holds the role is a [`GrantOutcome::AlreadyHeld`]
//! no-op.
//!
//! ## The honest boundary — a role is an attestation, not a proof
//!
//! A Discord role is an **attestation by Discord** (and by whoever in the guild can
//! hand roles out). It is convenient, revocable, and legible — and it is exactly as
//! trustworthy as the guild's role administration, no more. It is NOT a dregg proof.
//!
//! So the rule this module keeps: a role may GATE a surface (a UX convenience, and a
//! cheap first filter), but where authority must be **cryptographic** — where the
//! answer has to survive an adversary who controls their own client — the referee is
//! the real cap system, not the role. That referee is the executor (a `TurnReceipt`
//! is refused or it lands) and the macaroon keychain
//! (`dregg_sdk::AgentCipherclerk::{mint_token, attenuate, verify_token}`, surfaced as
//! `/cipherclerk mint | attenuate | authorize`). A held role that *says* "verified"
//! is a hint to show the button; the `verify_token` / executor check is what actually
//! decides whether the effect is allowed to happen. The two are wired so the role can
//! never be *the* authority for anything a forged client could exploit.
