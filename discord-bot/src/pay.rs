//! `$DREGG`-paid, real-AI dungeon runs — the bot's consumption of the committed
//! [`dregg_pay`] backend + the [`dregg_narrator`] hosted narrator.
//!
//! The loop this wires:
//!
//! 1. **`/buy-credits`** issues the caller's deterministic per-user Solana deposit address
//!    ([`HdDeposit::deposit_address`]) — same user ⇒ same address — and shows the price per run.
//! 2. A **payment poll** ([`PayState::poll_and_credit`]) polls the [`Watcher`] for that address and
//!    credits run-credits via [`CreditLedger::credit`], **idempotent** by the payment reference (a
//!    re-poll never double-credits).
//! 3. **`/balance`** reads [`CreditLedger::balance`] (persisted in sqlite, so it survives restart).
//! 4. A **paid `/dungeon` run** ([`PayState::try_paid_run`]) debits ONE credit
//!    ([`CreditLedger::debit`]) and routes to **real Bedrock** ([`dregg_narrator::metered_converse`])
//!    under a **PER-RUN USD budget** — a fresh [`BudgetLedger`] capped at `usd_per_run` at a unique
//!    path, so the debited credit *is* the budget. This is NOT the single global `$20` cap (a public
//!    bot on one shared cap would let one run drain everyone). An **empty balance** falls back to the
//!    FREE tier (ollama/scripted) — the paid backend is never free-ridden.
//!
//! **Safety.** Nothing mainnet is hardcoded: the mint/treasury/seed are operator config
//! ([`PayConfig::from_env`]); with no operator env the bot falls back to a DEVNET/MOCK
//! config with a throwaway seed and a [`MockWatcher`]. **The watcher is selected by
//! config** ([`select_watcher`]): an operator-supplied config gets the REAL
//! [`SolanaWatcher`] over the configured RPC — watch-only (it reads token-account state,
//! holds no key, and never touches the seed) — while the mock is reachable ONLY
//! explicitly (the no-env devnet fallback, or `DREGG_PAY_MOCK=1` on a non-mainnet
//! network). A mainnet config can never ride the mock, and a mainnet config without a
//! real RPC fails loudly at construction — never a silent mock on a real network. The
//! SWEEPER holding the custody seed still runs as a separate operator service.
