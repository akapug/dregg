//! **The daily-reveal cron — the DESCENT rolls automatically at the UTC-day boundary.**
//!
//! `docs/GAME-STRATEGY.md` names the daily reveal: "at midnight … a new dungeon is revealed."
//! Today that was a manual `/descent play`; this closes the seam. A background tokio task
//! (`start`) ticks on an interval, computes the current UTC **day number**, and when the day
//! strictly advances it fires the reveal: it FETCHES today's live drand `quicknet` round (BLS-
//! verified — [`procgen_dregg::beacon::todays_beacon_or_pinned`]), CACHES that verified beacon so
//! every `/descent` surface serves it ([`crate::commands::descent::set_live_beacon`]), OPENS
//! today's [`DailyDescentOffering`] (fail-closed — a forged reveal opens nothing), and announces
//! the day. The daily then rolls on its own — no manual command.
//!
//! It mirrors the `starbridge-web-surface` `RevealReactor` pattern (a temporal tick → the daily
//! reveal) with the same **strictly-monotonic day** tooth: [`RevealClock`] only reveals a day that
//! strictly advances the last-revealed one, so a re-tick within the same day (or a replayed clock)
//! is an idempotent no-op — the daily cannot be double-revealed.
//!
//! ## What is live here vs the deploy remainder
//! - **Live (wired here):** the day-boundary trigger, the live drand fetch + verify, the verified
//!   beacon cached into every `/descent` surface, and today's world opened + published.
//! - **The deploy remainder (ops, not code):** a RUNNING bot instance with network access to a
//!   drand node (until then the offline pinned round is served — still a genuine BLS-verified
//!   reveal), and the crown's LIVE-NOTARY (the DM narrator over real MPC-TLS) — a separate frontier.
//!
//! ## Driven, not LARPed
//! The reveal CORE ([`reveal_day`] / [`open_todays_world`]) is a pure, `Discord`-free function
//! driven by the tests below over an in-memory character store + a real `ugc_dregg::Registry`: the
//! scheduler firing opens today's descent with today's beacon seed, a same-day re-tick is a no-op,
//! and a simulated new day (a different verified beacon) rolls a genuinely different dungeon.
