//! End-to-end multi-agent ORCHESTRATION demo — the polis loop, run for real and
//! wall-clock measured.
//!
//! The product/polis assessment (`.docs-history-noclaude/rebuild/metatheory/_PRODUCT-POLIS-ASSESSMENT.md`,
//! §2) found the agent-orchestration substrate genuine but UNDER-DEMONSTRATED:
//! "the pieces (spawn → delegate → worker submits gated turn → grantor revokes)
//! are all present and unit-tested, but there is no single runnable example that
//! an onboarding agent can replay to *see* the loop." This binary IS that
//! runnable transcript, and it MEASURES every leg so the polis claim is grounded
//! in numbers, not assertion.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release -p dregg-perf --bin orchestration-demo`
//!
//! The loop, leg by leg, every step routed through the SAME production code the
//! SDK/node use (no shadow, no fake):
//!
//!   1. EMBODIMENT — a parent agent (`AgentRuntime`) gets a cell, a keypair, and
//!      a verified turn path. It mints a root capability over the `compute`
//!      service.
//!   2. ATTENUATED DELEGATION — the parent `spawn_sub_agent_scoped`s two workers,
//!      each scoped to exactly the `execute` verb. Each worker gets its OWN cell +
//!      keypair and an attenuated, executor-enforced biscuit credential. The
//!      parent NEVER hands over a key.
//!   3. EXECUTOR-ENFORCED MANDATE (the goodwill-independent tooth) — a worker's
//!      in-scope `execute` turn COMMITS (the executor's `verify_token_authorization`
//!      admits it); the SAME worker's over-scope `transfer` turn is REJECTED by
//!      the executor itself with `TokenInsufficientCapability`. Safety is enforced
//!      by the runtime, not by trusting the worker.
//!   4. PROVENANCE — each worker turn binds to its own receipt chain
//!      (`previous_receipt_hash`); we print the chain so a third party can see the
//!      tamper-evident link.
//!   5. VERIFIED COORDINATION — the two workers' outputs are coordinated by
//!      settling an award ring atomically + conservingly through the VERIFIED
//!      per-asset executor (`dregg_intent::verified_settle::settle_ring_verified`,
//!      the Rust mirror of the Lean `Ring.settleRing` whose `settleRing_atomic` /
//!      `settleRing_conserves` are machine-checked). A tampered ring (a leg that
//!      leaks value) is REJECTED fail-closed — we demonstrate that too.
//!
//! Each leg's wall-clock time is printed so the assessment's latency section can
//! cite a measured orchestration cost, not just a prover micro-benchmark.
