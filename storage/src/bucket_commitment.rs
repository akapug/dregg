//! commitment + the trustless verified read.
//!
//! Ported dregg-native from the retired operated layer's object store
//! (the prior operated layer — the leaf-fold, the injective
//! anti-alias packing, and `verify_opening`), over the SAME native circuit
//! primitives the old code already imported (`dregg_circuit::heap_root::
//! compute_heap_root_entries`, `dregg_circuit::poseidon2::wire_commit_8`).
//! The bucket *data plane* (cap-gated put/get/list/delete, receipts, metering)

//! this module carries is the commitment scheme that made a bucket read
//! **trustless** — the piece with no other native carrier.
//!
//! - [`object_leaf`] — the per-object leaf `H(key, content_type, body)`, a wide
//!   8-felt (~124-bit) Poseidon2 digest with **injective** byte→felt packing
//!   (3 bytes/felt, no modular wraparound — defeats the 4-byte `% p` `+p`-alias
//!   class) and length-delimited parts.
//! - [`content_root`] — the bucket commitment: the sorted-Poseidon2 cell-heap
//!   fold over the object leaves (`compute_heap_root_entries`) published through
//!   the kernel's 8-felt faithful widening (`wire_commit_8`) — a WIDE carrier
//!   chain with no 31-bit intermediate (the `FAITHFUL-STATE-COMMITMENT.md`
//!   discipline).
//! - [`ObjectOpening`] / [`verify_opening`] — **the trustless read**: served
//!   bytes re-witnessed against the committed root with no trust in the server.
//!
//! The domain-separation string (`dregg-bucket-content-root-v1`) is native to
