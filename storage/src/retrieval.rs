//! Light-client retrieval over the erasure-coded availability layer.
//!
//! [`availability`](crate::availability) gives a light client the two ends of
//! the data-availability story — an [`AvailabilityManifest`] (the small,
//! content-addressed record it holds) and [`availability::reconstruct`] (verify
//! a chunk set against the manifest root and rebuild the blob). What was missing
//! was the *fetch loop* between them: pull `k`-of-`n` chunks from one or more
//! (untrusted) operators, Merkle-verify each against the manifest root, and
//! reconstruct — so a single node **withholding** the bytes no longer breaks
//! retrieval.
//!
//! This module is that loop, kept **peer-agnostic**: it talks to a
//! [`ChunkSource`] (one operator/peer that *may or may not* hold any given
//! chunk and is *not trusted* to return honest bytes). The HTTP wiring (a node
//! serving `GET /storage/chunk/{hash}/{index}`, a client adapter that hits one
//! peer's URL) lives in `dregg-node`; the trust-bearing logic — Merkle
//! membership per chunk, k-of-n threshold, content-hash binding, and the
//! data-availability sampling confidence — lives here, where it is exercised by
//! pure tests with synthetic peers (honest, withholding, and forging).
//!
//! # The retrieval guarantee
//!
//! Given a manifest verified against a commitment, [`retrieve`] returns the
//! original bytes iff at least `manifest.n_data` chunks are obtainable across
//! the supplied sources AND each obtained chunk authenticates against
//! `manifest.root`. Concretely:
//!
//! * a peer that **withholds** chunks (returns `None`) is simply skipped — as
//!   long as `n_data` chunks survive across all peers, retrieval succeeds
//!   (the k-of-n availability property);
//! * a peer that **forges** a chunk (tampered data, or a valid chunk from a
//!   different blob/position) is rejected by [`erasure::verify_chunk_against_root`]
//!   before it can influence reconstruction — a forged chunk never counts toward
//!   the threshold;
//! * the final reconstruction is content-hash bound (`availability::reconstruct`),
//!   so the recovered blob is provably the one named by the manifest.
