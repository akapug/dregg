//! **The HARD GATE — a `DungeonOffering` plays through the `WeChatFrontend`.**
//!
//! The SAME offering core the Discord bot and the Telegram frontend drive, driven here through a
//! REAL [`WeChatFrontend`] over a network-free [`MockTransport`] — NO Discord, NO WeChat token, NO
//! network. It proves the offering core is frontend-agnostic: the same `DungeonOffering`, a new
//! renderer (an OA numbered-reply surface instead of an inline keyboard).
//!
//! What is asserted at the logic level (what a live token/cert would add is only the actual HTTP
//! send — the [`transport::Transport`] seam):
//! - **render → an OA text message + numbered reply list**: `present` builds the real `custom/send`
//!   wire body, with ONE numbered line per cap-gated affordance;
//! - **collect(reply) → (SessionId, Action, DreggIdentity)**: a numbered reply decodes back into the
//!   exact typed [`Action`] the core resolves, attributed to the sender's derived identity;
//! - **a real turn**: the collected action, resolved on the substrate, lands a real `TurnReceipt`
//!   (a winning line), and an illegal move is a real executor `Refused` (the anti-ghost tooth);
//! - **verify()** re-verifies the whole committed chain by replay;
//! - **identity** is a real derived Ed25519 key, deterministic + distinct per OpenID.
