//! # `dreggnet-wechat` — the FOURTH frontend for DreggNet Cloud (after Discord #0, Telegram, web).
//!
//! A [`WeChatFrontend`] implementing the frontend-agnostic [`dreggnet_offerings::Frontend`] trait
//! over the committed `dreggnet-offerings` core, so a **WeChat user plays the SAME
//! [`DungeonOffering`](dreggnet_offerings::dungeon::DungeonOffering) on the SAME real dregg
//! substrate** as the Discord bot — the same cap-gated affordances, the same real verifiable
//! [`TurnReceipt`](dregg_app_framework::TurnReceipt)s, the same executor-is-sole-referee anti-ghost
//! tooth. Only the SURFACE differs. This proves the core is frontend-agnostic.
//!
//! ## The WeChat surface model — Official Account numbered replies (canonical)
//! WeChat is the heaviest platform, and an Official Account **forbids arbitrary per-message
//! buttons**: its persistent menu is static (configured once, ≤3×5, not per-turn), and a template
//! message is a fixed-format notification. So dynamic, per-turn cap-gated affordances cannot be
//! buttons. The cleanest OA-native surface is a **numbered reply list**: the room + its affordances
//! are one text message with a `1.`-indexed list, and the user **replies with the number** to pick
//! a move (the reply arrives as an inbound text message — [`WeChatMessage`]). This is the lightest
//! path (a subscription/service OA, no Mini-Program review). A [`api::MiniProgramCard`] payload is
//! provided for the RICH surface (real buttons in a Mini-Program's WXML), but the OA numbered-reply
//! is CANONICAL. Both map the SAME offering affordances — no reinvention.
//!
//! ## The three mappings (a `Frontend` is an affordance-renderer)
//! - **identity(openid) → a derived dregg identity.** A WeChat OpenID → a BLAKE3-derived 32-byte
//!   seed → a REAL `AgentCipherclerk` Ed25519 identity, hex-encoded into a [`DreggIdentity`]. Same
//!   primitive as telegram/discord, a WeChat-scoped domain ([`cipherclerk`]) so id-spaces never
//!   collide.
//! - **present(Surface) → an OA text message.** The offering's deos [`Surface`] view-tree is
//!   rendered by the SHARED [`deos_view::WeChatBackend`] ([`api::present_message`]) into prose + a
//!   numbered reply list over the whole gated tree's actuations (full node coverage); the body is
//!   wrapped into the `custom/send` wire request ([`api::build_present_request`]) and sent through
//!   an INJECTED [`transport::Transport`] — the whole thing drives with [`transport::MockTransport`]
//!   (no token, no network). The rendered [`deos_view::WeChatMessage`] (its options table) is kept
//!   per session for the reply.
//! - **collect(inbound message) → (SessionId, Action, DreggIdentity).** A user's reply is resolved
//!   against the presented [`deos_view::WeChatMessage`] ([`deos_view::WeChatMessage::resolve`] — a
//!   reply number or a `#<turn>:<arg>` marked id), reconstructed into the typed [`Action`], and the
//!   firing user's derived identity attributes the move.
//!
//! ## Session shape: per-OpenID, single-player
//! A WeChat OA conversation is **1:1** — there is no group-chat affordance surface (unlike Telegram
//! groups / forum topics). So each session is keyed by the user's OpenID ([`WeChatFrontend::session_id`]
//! → `wx:<openid>`) and is single-player. (A crowd-driven session would need a Mini-Program's own
//! multiplayer surface; that ballot/tally lives one layer up in the orchestrator, unchanged from the
//! other frontends — the core still resolves the single typed [`Action`] picked.)
