//! # commons-arbiter — the AI authority nobody owns, as a runnable core
//!
//! The **Commons Arbiter** (`docs/deos/UNCENSORABLE-UTILITY.md`) is a neutral service that
//! rules on cases against a community's published **rubric** — its "constitution" — where no
//! single operator can forge, bias, or halt a ruling. This crate is its **runnable core**.
//!
//! A member submits a [`Case`] (content + the rubric id it is judged under); the Arbiter's
//! **confined + attested brain** reads it against the [`Rubric`] and issues a [`Ruling`]; the
//! ruling lands as a **receipted attested turn** on a [`CaseLedger`], carrying a
//! [`dregg_zkoracle_prove::ZkOracleAttestation`] proving the turn was:
//!
//! ```text
//!   authentic     — from a real model (a genuine `/v1/messages` session), not forged;
//!   well-formed   — the response body lies in the JSON context-free language;
//!   injection-free — the bound ruling text carries no `{{` handlebars delimiter.
//! ```
//!
//! ## The killer property — an un-censorable authority
//!
//! A case whose content carries a **prompt-injection** (`{{`, or the handlebars injection
//! template) is **reflected into the ruling** — an arbiter states *what the case said* — and
//! there the **injection-free leg** catches it: the ruling over that input **cannot be
//! attested** ([`ArbiterError::Injection`]), so the ruling is **refused** and the ledger gains
//! nothing (the anti-ghost tooth). Nobody can inject a verdict into the Arbiter. This is the
//! same verified `neg`-complement matcher `verify_zkoracle` runs, so a forged attestation that
//! smuggled a `{{` field would ALSO be rejected at verify.
//!
//! ## Cap-bounded authority
//!
//! The Arbiter rules only under the rubric ids in its [`ArbiterCaps`] **jurisdiction** — its
//! authority is exactly the cap the community granted it (`UNCENSORABLE-UTILITY.md` §1). A
//! case under a rubric outside that jurisdiction is refused **fail-closed** ([`ArbiterError::
//! OutOfJurisdiction`]), ledger unchanged, before any attestation.
//!
//! ## No single operator owns it — the quorum
//!
//! A ruling is a record; it becomes **final** only when a committee of `n` genuinely
//! independent operators super-ratifies it, `⌊2n/3⌋+1` of them ([`quorum`]). A single
//! operator — or any `f = ⌊(n−1)/3⌋`-sized minority — cannot finalize it or forge one: a
//! ratification of a *different* (forged) commitment does not count toward the true ruling's
//! quorum. This is the `VoteEngine`-shaped stub of the real `collective-choice` / blocklace
//! finality; the live independent-operator federation deploy is the named operational
//! remainder (`UNCENSORABLE-UTILITY.md` §4).
//!
//! ## What is REAL vs modeled
//!
//! * **REAL — the attestation.** Produced by [`dregg_zkoracle_prove::prove_zkoracle`] and
//!   checked by [`dregg_zkoracle_prove::verify_zkoracle`] (authentic ∧ well-formed ∧
//!   injection-free). The SAME primitives `deos_hermes::attest::AttestationCarrier` wraps;
//!   composed here DIRECTLY so the Arbiter stays light (no HTTP/TLS). The real local MPC-TLS
//!   2PC roundtrip is behind the `tlsn-live` feature.
//! * **REAL — the case ledger.** Every landed ruling is appended to [`CaseLedger`] with a
//!   32-byte receipt commitment ([`attestation_commitment`]); [`CaseLedger::verify_ledger`]
//!   re-verifies the whole chain and a tampered / swapped / forged entry is distinguishable.
//! * **REAL — the cap bound + the quorum gate.** [`ArbiterCaps::authorize`] gates every case;
//!   [`quorum::QuorumCommittee`] finalizes only at `⌊2n/3⌋+1`.
//! * **MODELED — the brain.** A [`RulingBrain`] turns the rubric + case into a ruling; the
//!   default [`RecordedArbiter`] is a deterministic stand-in for a live LLM. The full OS-jailed
//!   confined body is `deos_hermes::DreggHost::run_hosted_agent_attested` (the crown).
