//! **THE FOLD FOLDS OVER THE REAL WORLDCELL CELL** — not a `pk[0]=7` fixture.
//!
//! The mannequin this closes: the Phase-3 fold minted every leg over a synthetic
//! `producer_cell` (pk[0]=7, balance 1000, identical for every match), so a game's published
//! win root was a genuine commitment but was NOT welded to the actual cell's heap state. Here
//! the terminal win folds over the game's OWN committed cell (`WorldCell::cell_snapshot`),
//! carrying its real pk / balance / heap — the winner it publishes is a register the cell's
//! v9 commitment (`old8`/`new8`, the deployed state-binding prefix) actually commits.
//!
//! The FAST battery drives the weld without a STARK: the real cell's commitment differs from
//! the fixture's, moves with the committed winner, and the win leaf's public-input commitment
//! moves when its `[old8 ‖ new8]` prefix is the real cell's vs the fixture's. The SLOW
//! `#[ignore]` fold mints the deployed recursion artifact and `verify_history` accepts it.
//!
//! The winner weld itself is DEPLOYED at the WorldCell executor: `tests/round.rs`'s
//! `false_win_claim_is_refused` shows a false winner (meeting neither threshold) is refused at
//! the `score` admission by the installed `winner==p ⇒ charm_p>=11 OR guilds_p>=4` implication
//! — so a fold never receives a cell whose committed winner did not win.
