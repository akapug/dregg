//! # The state declaration + the Lean-sourced play teeth.
//!
//! The multiway-tug STATE is declared as a [`dregg_schema::Schema`] and lowered by the
//! CONSUMED dregg-schema allocator ([`dregg_schema::layout::allocate_checked`]) to a
//! Legal (disjoint + in-bounds, the RotatedLayout discipline) slot/heap layout: the 16
//! scalar counters/win-registers land in the register file, the 8 used-flags + 14
//! per-guild placement scores land on heap keys `16..37`.
//!
//! The PLAY TEETH are **authored in Lean** (`metatheory/Dregg2/Games/MultiwayTugProgram.lean
//! :: multiwayTugProgram`), emitted to `program/multiway_tug_program.json`, and LOADED by
//! [`Deployment::program`] via [`crate::program_loader`], which resolves the symbolic slot/method
//! NAMES against this allocator. There is no hand-rolled `CellProgram::Cases` in Rust — the
//! deployed program IS the Lean object (see `docs/audit/SEMANTIC-LEAN-BOUNDARY.md` Step 1 / T4).
//! The teeth the Lean value encodes, each still exactly the deployed referee:
//!
//! * **21-card conservation** — `SumEquals` over the eight card-zone counters `== 21`, on
//!   EVERY move post-state. A play that conjures or destroys a favor breaks the sum and is
//!   refused.
//! * **one-action-per-round** — `HeapAtom::WriteOnce` on each `(player, action)` used-flag
//!   (written with the round's strictly-increasing action stamp, so any reuse changes the
//!   frozen flag and is refused).
//! * **monotone scores** — `HeapAtom::Monotonic` on each per-guild placement counter (a
//!   placed favor cannot be un-placed within the round).
//! * **strict round sequencing** — `StrictMonotonic` on `round_actions` (each action turn
//!   advances the counter).
//! * **the win** — the `score` method binds `winner == p ⇒ (charm_p >= 11 OR guilds_p >=
//!   4)` via `AnyOf[Not(FieldEquals(winner,p)), FieldGte(charm_p,11), FieldGte(guilds_p,4)]`,
//!   plus `WriteOnce(winner)` and `FieldGte(round_actions, 8)` (scoring only after the
//!   round completes). A false win claim is refused.
//!
//! `genesis` is the one permissive case (it seeds the initial counts + the heap keys the
//! relational teeth read as an `old` value).
