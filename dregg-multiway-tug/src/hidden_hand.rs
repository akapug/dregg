//! # Phase 2 — the zk HIDDEN-HAND (the differentiated "nobody sees your hand,
//! nobody cheats" layer).
//!
//! Phase 0 hid the hand only by NON-REVEAL on a trusted host (the card counts are
//! public, the identities live in the [`crate::reference`] mover). Phase 2 makes the
//! hidden hand **cryptographic**:
//!
//! * **At DEAL, each player's hand is COMMITTED as a Poseidon2 4-ary Merkle root**
//!   ([`HandTree`]) — the tussle/sealed-auction COMMIT phase, lifted from a BLAKE3
//!   digest of a scalar to a Merkle root over the dealt cards. Each leaf is a blinded
//!   commitment `Poseidon2(DOMAIN, card, nonce, 0)`, so the root HIDES which cards are
//!   in the hand (the per-card nonce blinds even the small card space) and BINDS the
//!   player to exactly that multiset.
//!
//! * **Each PLAY carries a [`StateConstraint::Witnessed`] `{ MerkleMembership }` proof**
//!   ([`PlayProof`]) — a Poseidon2 Merkle authentication path from the played card's
//!   leaf to the committed root. It is verified through the cell's REAL
//!   [`WitnessedPredicateRegistry`] by the REAL [`CellProgram::evaluate_full`] — the
//!   exact evaluator + the exact `registry.verify` the executor runs
//!   (`cell/src/program/eval.rs`, the `Witnessed` arm). A play whose card genuinely
//!   sits under the committed root VERIFIES while revealing NOTHING about the other
//!   cards; a play of a FABRICATED card (one not under the root, or a wrong opening)
//!   cannot produce a path to the root (Poseidon2 collision-resistance) and is
//!   REFUSED.
//!
//! * **The remaining-hand root UPDATES** each play ([`HandTree::without`]): the played
//!   card is removed and the tree recommitted. A re-play of the same committed card
//!   against the UPDATED remaining root fails membership (its leaf is no longer under
//!   the root) — the crypto is the no-double-play tooth, not a bookkeeping flag.
//!
//! * **The Gift / Competition BLIND PICK + the concealed SECRET ride a commit→reveal**
//!   ([`BlindPick`]) — the identical construction the sealed-auction / tussle apps use
//!   (`seal = BLAKE3(domain || payload || nonce)`): the opponent COMMITS their pick
//!   (only the seal is public — the pick is unreadable from it), then REVEALS. A
//!   pre-reveal peek reads only the seal; a post-reveal SWAP (revealing a pick whose
//!   seal is not the committed one) is REFUSED.
//!
//! ## What is cryptographic NOW vs the named next phases
//!
//! The Merkle-committed hand, the membership-proven play, and the commit→reveal picks
//! run on the EXECUTOR: the membership proof is **executor-checked** — the real
//! [`WitnessedPredicateRegistry`] verifier, dispatched by the real cell evaluator, is
//! the acceptance gate (not a side check). The committed roots + the phase machine
//! bind into a real [`spween_dregg::WorldCell`] receipt ([`HiddenHandLedger`]), where
//! the executor's own `WriteOnce` / `StrictMonotonic` / `Monotonic` teeth bite the
//! committed hand root, the play generation, and the phase.
//!
//! NAMED NEXT (honest scope, `docs/VERIFIED-GAME-PORTFOLIO.md`): **Phase 3** — the
//! STARK fold, lowering this `Witnessed { MerkleMembership }` tooth into the
//! now-Lane-D-unblocked fold (the `MerkleAir` — `circuit/src/merkle_types.rs` — proves
//! the SAME 4-ary Poseidon2 path this module checks in the clear; a whole private
//! match → one succinct proof; the Witnessed lowering is the game-turn-slice residual
//! to wire). **Phase 4** the Lean refinement. **Phase 5** the Offering + frontends.
