//! # Phase 5 — the **Offering** + the per-player HIDDEN-HAND surface.
//!
//! [`TugOffering`] hosts a multiway-tug round as a [`dreggnet_offerings::Offering`]: the
//! same `open`/`actions`/`advance`/`verify`/`render`/`price` shape every dreggnet frontend
//! (Discord / Telegram / WeChat / web) already drives. A play is a REAL executor turn (the
//! [`crate::game::MultiwayTug`] driver commits the [`crate::reference::Engine`]'s projection
//! under the action method — a legal move lands a [`dreggnet_offerings::Outcome::Landed`]
//! receipt, an out-of-turn / illegal one is a [`dreggnet_offerings::Outcome::Refused`] that
//! commits nothing).
//!
//! **The differentiated bit — the per-player fog.** [`Offering::render`] paints ONE public
//! surface (both hands are FOG — a count + the committed hand root). [`Offering::render_for`]
//! paints the surface *as a specific viewer sees it*: the viewer's OWN hand is revealed (the
//! card ids they hold, sourced from the [`crate::hidden_hand`] committed [`HandTree`]), while
//! the opponent stays fog. So player A's card ids appear in A's view and NOT in B's view of
//! the same table — the hidden-hand fog, in the UI.
//!
//! HONEST SCOPE: this is the hidden hand **in the UI** (what a frontend paints for a viewer) —
//! DISTINCT from the hidden hand **in the proof** (the committed Merkle fold the executor gates
//! on, [`crate::hidden_hand`]). The two agree (the surface reveals what the viewer legitimately
//! holds under their committed root) but are separate seams. The guild-lane table + the
//! coordinate-grid hand + the action menu are the deos affordance surface; the play wiring is a
//! real [`crate::game::MultiwayTug`] turn. NAMED NEXT: an `AutomataflOffering` over the same
//! coordinate-grid board node.
