//! # The async match-fold proving service — deploy-plan Phase 3.
//!
//! **The whole-match STARK fold runs OFF the player's critical path.** Play is
//! interactive-fast; the fold ([`dreggnet_game_board::prove_match`] →
//! `prove_turn_chain_recursive`) is minutes-to-hours. So a finished match is
//! [`enqueue`](ProveService::enqueue)d — returning a [`JobId`] IMMEDIATELY — and
//! folded on a BACKGROUND WORKER POOL. The player polls
//! [`status`](ProveService::status) (or blocks on [`wait`](ProveService::wait))
//! and, when the job is [`JobStatus::Done`], submits the succinct proof to the
//! proof-carrying board. The UX is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   play (fast) ──▶ enqueue ──▶ [ fold on a worker, GPU-dispatched ] ──▶ rank when Done
//!        │             │                     │                              │
//!    interactive   a JobId,             the ~45-min fold,               a MatchProof
//!    (no fold)     instantly            off the play path            (submit, never moves)
//! ```
//!
//! ## This is the PRODUCTION pool — the per-turn pattern, extended to the match
//!
//! `node/src/prove_pool.rs` moved the ~0.75 s per-TURN attestation off the
//! commit/write-lock path onto a bounded MPSC + a fixed worker set (off-lock,
//! `DREGG_PROVE_WORKERS`/`DREGG_PROVE_QUEUE_DEPTH`, metric-counted). This service
//! is that same shape, lifted to the whole `WholeChainProof` match fold:
//!
//! | `prove_pool.rs` (per turn)              | this service (per match)                 |
//! | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
//! | bounded `tokio::mpsc` queue             | bounded `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`  |
//! | N `spawn_blocking` workers, off-lock    | N OS-thread workers, off-lock            |
//! | `DREGG_PROVE_WORKERS` / `_QUEUE_DEPTH`  | `DREGG_MATCH_PROVE_WORKERS` / `_QUEUE_DEPTH` |
//! | drop-on-full (commit already sound)     | drop-on-full (the play already happened) |
//! | `metrics::inc_async_proofs_*`           | [`Metrics`] atomics                      |
//!
//! Bounding both the concurrency (N workers) and the queue (a depth cap, past
//! which [`enqueue`](ProveService::enqueue) returns `None` rather than blocking)
//! is what keeps a proving flood from wedging the host — the play path is never
//! blocked, and a dropped job is a *liveness* degradation of the enrichment
//! layer (the match can be re-enqueued), never a safety problem.
//!
//! [`ProveService`] is generic over the job input `I` and the proof output `O`
//! so the pool mechanics (bounded concurrency, status, metrics, off-lock) are
//! driven fast with stub backends, while the concrete
//! [`MatchProveService`] = `ProveService<`[`PlayedMatch`]`, `[`MatchProof`]`>`
//! runs the real deployed fold ([`fold_played_match`]).
//!
//! ## GPU dispatch on the fold path (honest scope)
//!
//! The fold reaches the GPU through the same runtime dispatch the rest of the
//! prover uses: [`dregg_circuit_prove::gpu_backend`]'s `GpuDft` / `GpuBn254Mmcs`
//! select the GPU kernels when an adapter is present and fall back to the CPU
//! path (identical types, identical output) when it is not — [`gpu::available`]
//! reports which. The GPU speedup is realized on a GPU box; the correctness of a
//! folded proof is identical either way (bit-exact roots), so the CPU box is the
//! correctness gate and the GPU box is the speed win.
//!
//! **What is REAL here:** the async service — proving is OFF the play path,
//! bounded and metered, the proof correctness-identical to the foreground fold.
//!
//! **NAMED (not built here), per the deploy plan:**
//! * **GPU-ing the whole-match fold's inner apex aggregation.** Today
//!   [`dreggnet_game_board::prove_match`] → `prove_turn_chain_recursive` folds
//!   through the CPU recursion config (`create_recursion_backend`,
//!   `Radix2DitParallel` DFT + `MerkleTreeMmcs`). The GPU recursion variant
//!   (`gpu_backend::create_gpu_recursion_config` / `prove_recursion_layer_gpu`,
//!   `GpuDft` + `GpuFoldValMmcs`) EXISTS and is runtime-dispatched, but routing
//!   the per-layer aggregation through it is a `circuit-prove` change this
//!   additive crate does not make. This is the ~241 s inner-MMCS lever — the
//!   order-of-magnitude (~45 min → ~20 min) needs it.
//! * **On-device (wasm) proving.** The fold runs wherever this service runs — a
//!   server-side worker. "The moves never leave the device" needs the prover
//!   compiled to the client, a separate workstream.
//! * **The service→board submit wire.** [`MatchProof`] is handed to
//!   [`dreggnet_game_board::GameBoard`] by the caller; this crate stops at
//!   `Done{proof}`.
