//! # `giver` — the CROSS-CELL quest-giver: a grant that READS the quest cell.
//!
//! [`crate`]'s turn-in reward is a SAME-CELL gate — the `reward` slot lives on the quest
//! cell, opened by a [`FieldGte`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::FieldGte) on that
//! cell's own committed progress. This module closes the other half the roadmap names: a
//! **quest-giver whose grant reads the quest cell**, a real cross-cell
//! [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] — "the giver hands over its reward BECAUSE the
//! objective was completed on ANOTHER cell." It re-homes [`dungeon_on_dregg::multicell`]'s
//! proven cross-cell gate onto a quest turn-in.
//!
//! ## The two cells share ONE executor ledger
//!
//! | cell | role | program (executor teeth) |
//! |------|------|--------------------------|
//! | [`QUEST`](QuestGiverWorld::quest) | the quest-state cell | authored [`CellProgram::Cases`] — ordered `WriteOnce`/`FieldDelta` step-flags + a `FieldGte(steps_done, N)` + `WriteOnce(reward)` turn-in (the [`crate`] teeth, authored directly in the [`dungeon_on_dregg::meta`] pattern so the cell can live on a shared ledger) |
//! | [`GIVER`](QuestGiverWorld::giver) | the quest-giver's grant | [`CellProgram::Predicate`]`([ObservedFieldEquals])` — the cross-cell gate |
//!
//! The giver cell carries ONE tooth: an [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] naming the
//! QUEST cell + its `reward` slot at the quest cell's **post-turn-in finalized root**
//! ([`QuestGiverWorld::grant_root`]). On every turn touching the giver, the verified
//! executor rebuilds a finalized-root authority from the COMMITTED LEDGER and admits the
//! grant IFF the quest cell's live commitment IS the grant root (the errand was turned in)
//! AND the giver's local grant value equals the quest cell's committed `reward`, with the
//! Merkle-open witness present. So:
//!
//! * **before the errand is turned in** the quest cell's commitment is not the grant root
//!   ⇒ the authority has no binding ⇒ the grant REFUSES (fail-closed);
//! * **after the player really completes + turns in the quest** the quest cell IS at the
//!   grant root ⇒ the authority binds `reward -> 1` ⇒ the giver grant COMMITS;
//! * a **forged grant** — granting before the turn-in, or with a value diverging from the
//!   quest's real reward, or with the witness stripped — is REFUSED. The authority is
//!   rebuilt from the LIVE ledger, never the submitter's claim.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — the finality source
//!
//! As in [`dungeon_on_dregg::multicell`]: in this in-process world the executor's
//! "finalized view" of the quest cell is its CURRENT committed state (turns commit
//! synchronously). The gate is genuinely executor-enforced ACROSS cells and fails closed;
//! the witness blob is STRUCTURALLY required (its absence refuses), and the host recomputes
//! the genuine `(cell, commitment, field, value)` from its own committed ledger. A
//! PRODUCTION finality source (a cross-node finalized-root channel / the recursive light
//! client) is the named add — it would furnish the quest cell's root from an independently
//! finalized chain, so the giver could gate on a quest cell on a DIFFERENT node's ledger.

// ── The FACTION-gated quest-giver: the giver opens on the REAL faction cell ─────────
//
// The reconciliation the saga names: the quest-giver's start opens ONLY when the player's
// standing with the Embers clears the faction threshold — read off dreggnet-faction's REAL
// committed faction cell through its CANONICAL SHARED READER
// ([`dreggnet_faction::standing::read_standing`] / [`FactionStanding::content_available`]),
// NOT a locally re-authored mirror. The standing is itself kernel-enforced, un-fakeable
// committed cell state on dreggnet-faction's own [`WorldCell`]: a `Monotonic` `rep_embers`
// ratchet (standing is never un-earned), a `FieldGte(rep_embers, `[`REP_THRESHOLD`]`)`-gated
// `WriteOnce(embers_quest)` trial, and a `WriteOnce(embers_betrayed)` betrayal seal. The
// giver consumes that standing as its gate, with every slot resolved BY NAME
// (`rep_embers` / `embers_quest` / `embers_betrayed`, via the roster's `rep_var` etc.), so
// the gate can never be pointed at the wrong slot — the SILENT-INVERSION hazard a hardcoded
// index carries (alphabetical slot 1 is `embers_quest`, slot 2 `embers_betrayed`, not `rep`)
// is structurally excluded.
//
// ## Honest scope — where the un-fakeability lives
//
// dreggnet-faction's [`WorldCell`] encapsulates its own executor, so the giver cannot pin an
// in-executor cross-cell [`ObservedFieldEquals`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals)
// against it (that needs both cells on ONE ledger, which the `WorldCell` boundary precludes).
// The gate is therefore a HOST read of the real committed faction cell via the canonical
// reader — but the standing it reads is un-fakeable KERNEL state: you cannot reach
// `rep_embers >= REP_THRESHOLD` without real `Monotonic`-ratcheted pledge turns the faction
// executor admits, and a betrayal permanently seals the content. This is exactly the consumer
// pattern [`dreggnet_faction::standing`] was built for (its doc names `dreggnet-quest` as the
// gap this closes) — the giver reads GENUINE standing, never a self-reported flag and never a
// re-guessed slot. The previous cross-cell predicate gated at the kernel but against a
// FABRICATED faction cell; this gates on the REAL one.
