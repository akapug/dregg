//! # `giver` — the CROSS-CELL quest-giver: a grant that READS the quest cell.
//!
//! [`crate`]'s turn-in reward is a SAME-CELL gate — the `reward` slot lives on the quest
//! cell, opened by a [`FieldGte`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::FieldGte) on that
//! cell's own committed progress. This module closes the other half the roadmap names: a
//! **quest-giver whose grant reads the quest cell**, a real cross-cell
//! [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] — "the giver hands over its reward BECAUSE the
//! objective was completed on ANOTHER cell." It re-homes [`dungeon_on_dregg::multicell`]'s
//! proven cross-cell gate onto a quest turn-in.
//!
//! ## The two cells share ONE executor ledger
//!
//! | cell | role | program (executor teeth) |
//! |------|------|--------------------------|
//! | [`QUEST`](QuestGiverWorld::quest) | the quest-state cell | authored [`CellProgram::Cases`] — ordered `WriteOnce`/`FieldDelta` step-flags + a `FieldGte(steps_done, N)` + `WriteOnce(reward)` turn-in (the [`crate`] teeth, authored directly in the [`dungeon_on_dregg::meta`] pattern so the cell can live on a shared ledger) |
//! | [`GIVER`](QuestGiverWorld::giver) | the quest-giver's grant | [`CellProgram::Predicate`]`([ObservedFieldEquals])` — the cross-cell gate |
//!
//! The giver cell carries ONE tooth: an [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] naming the
//! QUEST cell + its `reward` slot at the quest cell's **post-turn-in finalized root**
//! ([`QuestGiverWorld::grant_root`]). On every turn touching the giver, the verified
//! executor rebuilds a finalized-root authority from the COMMITTED LEDGER and admits the
//! grant IFF the quest cell's live commitment IS the grant root (the errand was turned in)
//! AND the giver's local grant value equals the quest cell's committed `reward`, with the
//! Merkle-open witness present. So:
//!
//! * **before the errand is turned in** the quest cell's commitment is not the grant root
//!   ⇒ the authority has no binding ⇒ the grant REFUSES (fail-closed);
//! * **after the player really completes + turns in the quest** the quest cell IS at the
//!   grant root ⇒ the authority binds `reward -> 1` ⇒ the giver grant COMMITS;
//! * a **forged grant** — granting before the turn-in, or with a value diverging from the
//!   quest's real reward, or with the witness stripped — is REFUSED. The authority is
//!   rebuilt from the LIVE ledger, never the submitter's claim.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — the finality source
//!
//! As in [`dungeon_on_dregg::multicell`]: in this in-process world the executor's
//! "finalized view" of the quest cell is its CURRENT committed state (turns commit
//! synchronously). The gate is genuinely executor-enforced ACROSS cells and fails closed;
//! the witness blob is STRUCTURALLY required (its absence refuses), and the host recomputes
//! the genuine `(cell, commitment, field, value)` from its own committed ledger. A
//! PRODUCTION finality source (a cross-node finalized-root channel / the recursive light
//! client) is the named add — it would furnish the quest cell's root from an independently
//! finalized chain, so the giver could gate on a quest cell on a DIFFERENT node's ledger.
