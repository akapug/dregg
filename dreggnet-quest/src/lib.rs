//! # `dreggnet-quest` — a QUEST is a gated committed cell, and a completion is a receipt.
//!
//! A quest-giver hands you a multi-step gated objective; each step is a real cap-bounded
//! turn that advances a [`WriteOnce`] step-flag; the steps are ORDER-gated (a deep step
//! cannot be raised until its prerequisite is set); you return and TURN IN for a reward
//! that opens only once the committed step-flags clear a [`FieldGte`] gate; and a
//! completion is a [`Playthrough`](spween_dregg::Playthrough) **re-executed to a declared
//! WIN** — never a self-reported "I did the steps."
//!
//! This is the **dialogue idiom generalized** (docs/GAME-INFRA-ROADMAP.md, world #1 — the
//! biggest world unlock). It re-homes [`dungeon_on_dregg::dialogue`]'s proven quest-giver
//! shape (`WriteOnce` topic step-flags, `BoundedBy` step-ordering, the `FieldGte`-gated
//! grant) onto a longer, ordered CHAIN with a return-and-turn-in reward, and binds the
//! completion to [`ugc_dregg`]'s no-cheat re-execution model.
//!
//! ## The failure mode this exists to kill
//!
//! The recurring LARP (docs roadmap, "FAILURE MODE"): quest state kept as **host
//! bookkeeping** — a client `steps_done += 1`, a turn-in that trusts a self-reported
//! count. Here **quest state is a gated committed cell**: every step-flag is real cell
//! state advanced by a real turn the verified executor admits IFF the step's gate passes,
//! the turn-in reward is a real [`FieldGte`] tooth on the committed `steps_done`, and the
//! completion is re-executed by a stranger — a forged / out-of-order record fails on
//! replay. Nothing here trusts the player's word.
//!
//! ## The quest — "The Loremaster's Errand" (a 3-step ordered chain)
//!
//! The [`ERRAND`] scene is one board room where each step is a self-looping choice (a real
//! turn that advances a step-flag and returns to the board), a turn-in choice gated on the
//! committed progress, and a hall reached once the reward is granted:
//!
//! | slot          | the quest cell remembers        | tooth (executor-enforced `StateConstraint`)                       |
//! |---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `step_1`      | the first ward is lit           | [`WriteOnce`] + [`FieldDelta`]`(+1)` — set once, only `0 -> 1`     |
//! | `step_2`      | the second ward is lit          | `WriteOnce` + `FieldDelta(+1)` + [`BoundedBy`]`(step_2 <- step_1)` |
//! | `step_3`      | the third ward is lit           | `WriteOnce` + `FieldDelta(+1)` + `BoundedBy(step_3 <- step_2)`     |
//! | `steps_done`  | how many wards are lit          | [`FieldDelta`]`(+1)` per step — moves in lockstep with the flags   |
//! | `reward`      | the errand is turned in         | [`FieldGte`]`(steps_done, 3)` + `WriteOnce` — the GATED turn-in    |
//!
//! The load-bearing details:
//!
//! * **A step is a real committed turn** advancing a [`WriteOnce`] flag; a step, once done,
//!   stays done, and **re-lighting a lit ward is REFUSED** (`FieldDelta(step_k, +1)` wants
//!   `0 -> 1`; a `1 -> 1` re-write has delta `0`) — so `steps_done` cannot be inflated by
//!   spamming one step. It moves in lockstep with the DISTINCT flags.
//! * **Order-gating** ([`BoundedBy`]): step 2 cannot be raised until step 1 is set, step 3
//!   until step 2 — "step B requires step A." An out-of-order step is a real
//!   [`WorldError::Refused`](spween_dregg::WorldError) that commits nothing (anti-ghost).
//! * **The turn-in reward is gated on the committed steps** ([`FieldGte`]`(steps_done, 3)`,
//!   compiler-emitted from `{ steps_done >= 3 }`, plus a [`WriteOnce`] `reward`): a turn-in
//!   without the steps is refused; with them it commits. Never an ungated grant.
//! * **A completion is a re-executed receipt** ([`verify_quest`] / [`quest_win`]): a
//!   recorded [`Playthrough`](spween_dregg::Playthrough) is re-driven against a fresh,
//!   identically-seeded quest cell and must reproduce the committed state chain AND reach
//!   the declared [`WinCondition`](ugc_dregg::WinCondition) (`reward == 1`). A forged record
//!   — an out-of-order step retconned in — fails [`verify_by_replay`](spween_dregg::verify_by_replay)
//!   on the `BoundedBy` tooth. This is the ugc-dregg no-cheat model, on a quest.
//!
//! ## The cross-cell quest-giver ([`giver`])
//!
//! The turn-in reward above is a SAME-CELL gate (the reward lives on the quest cell). The
//! [`giver`] module adds the CROSS-CELL half (the multicell idiom, [`dungeon_on_dregg::multicell`]):
//! a quest-giver cell whose grant is a real [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] reading
//! the quest cell's committed `reward` slot at its post-turn-in finalized root — the giver
//! hands over its reward only because the objective was completed on ANOTHER cell. The grant
//! is refused before the quest is turned in and commits after.
//!
//! ## Honest scope + named residuals
//!
//! * A completion is a **re-executed receipt**, not a client counter — the whole point.
//! * The quest is a FIXED 3-step ordered chain authored here (the concrete slice, like
//!   [`dungeon_on_dregg::dialogue`]'s Vigil). A **durable per-character quest LOG** (this
//!   crate's live cell is in-process; the persistent per-identity store is the character
//!   store's job, exactly as [`dungeon_on_dregg::progression`]'s sheet is), **branching
//!   quests gated on faction standing** (a `FieldGte` on a per-faction reputation slot — the
//!   faction whitespace the roadmap names), and **quests as authorable spween objects via
//!   the `/gallery` publish-scene flywheel** (an author writes the quest scene as text; the
//!   ordering teeth ride an attenuated `TransitionCase`, exactly [`ugc_dregg`]'s
//!   `authored_signed` path) are named seams over this real core, not gaps in it.
//! * The reward AMOUNT / the objective content are quest-design; the teeth guarantee the
//!   LEDGER invariant (ordered once-set step-flags, a step-gated turn-in, an un-fakeable
//!   completion), not the game-balance.
//!
