//! mlkem_live_encaps.rs — the RUNNING-BINARY gate that the node's deployed ML-KEM-768 ENCAPSULATION runs
//! through the VERIFIED Lean core (BRICK K5's `Dregg2.Crypto.MlKemEncaps.mlkemEncaps`), not the `ml-kem`
//! crate — and that the full Lean-routed handshake (Lean encaps → Lean decaps) agrees.
//!
//! ## What this proves ("the ml-kem crate leaves the LIVE KEM-encaps TCB")
//!
//! The hybrid session KEM initiator (`dregg_pq::hybrid_kem::initiate`) produces the ML-KEM-768 ciphertext +
//! shared secret. It routes through an install-time function pointer: with the REAL encaps core installed it
//! produces `(ct, K)` from the extracted, full-byte `MlKemEncaps.mlkemEncaps` running as leanc-native code and
//! NEVER calls the `ml-kem` crate's `.encapsulate` (`dregg-pq/src/hybrid_kem.rs`: the installed branch generates
//! a fresh 32-byte `m`, builds the `hex(ek) hex(m)` wire, calls the core, decodes `hex(ct) hex(K)`; the crate
//! `.encapsulate` sits only in the `else`). The X25519 + transcript + HKDF combiner is unchanged.
//!
//! The node installs that core at startup via `dregg_node::install_mlkem_verified_encaps_core()` (wired in
//! `node/src/lib.rs` right after the ML-KEM decaps install). This test drives that EXACT production install
//! function — not a copy — then:
//!
//!   1. asserts `dregg_pq::mlkem_encaps_real_core_installed()` is `true` after the install;
//!   2. mints a GENUINE ML-KEM-768 keypair with the `ml-kem` crate, feeds the verified Lean encaps shadow the
//!      SAME `hex(ek) hex(m)` wire the node builds, and asserts the crate — decapsulating the Lean-produced
//!      ciphertext — recovers the Lean-produced shared secret (`decapsulate(dk, ct_lean) == K_lean`): the Lean
//!      encaps produced a genuine ct/K pair (byte-exactness vs the crate's deterministic encaps is the
//!      build-time proof `encaps_matches_crate`);
//!   3. drives the DEPLOYED hybrid path end-to-end with BOTH cores installed (`responder_offer` → `initiate`
//!      Lean-encaps → `finish` Lean-decaps): `initiator_key == responder_key`, and a ciphertext tampered in
//!      flight makes the two DIVERGE.
//!
//! ## If the linked archive lacks the export
//!
//! `install_mlkem_verified_encaps_core()` gates on `mlkem_encaps_real_core_available()`: a build whose Lean
//! archive does not export `dregg_mlkem_encaps_real` returns `ExportAbsent` and the node keeps the `ml-kem`-
//! crate fallback. In that build the routing cannot be demonstrated; the test FAILS LOUDLY with the exact
//! blocker rather than passing vacuously.
