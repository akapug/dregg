//! ⚑ **THE EXHIBIT: the reflexive endpoint tooth becoming real.**
//!
//! `dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound` takes `expected_old_commit` / `expected_new_commit` from its
//! CALLER, and until 2026-08-07 no production surface had them. The one that re-verifies a served
//! artifact for a stranger — `discord-bot`'s `/proof turn` — read the pair **out of the artifact**
//! (`proof_verify::extract_commits`) and handed it straight back, so the verifier's two
//! `CommitmentMismatch` teeth compared `x != x` and **structurally could not fire**.
//!
//! This file drives the closure end to end, through the REAL router:
//!
//! * a REAL full-turn STARK from the production prover (`turn_proving::prove_and_verify_finalized_turn`);
//! * the pair the node's commit path DERIVED for it, persisted under the same key
//!   `blocklace_sync` writes (`turn_proving::turn_proof_anchors_config_key`);
//! * `GET /api/turn/{hash}/anchor` serving it as `proof_state_commits`, parsed with the SHARED
//!   codec the checker parses it with (`dregg_circuit::commit8_wire`) — no second convention;
//! * **COMPLETENESS**: the honest artifact verifies against the served pair;
//! * ⚑ **THE REFUSAL, EXHIBITED**: one lane of the served pair moved, and the same call is
//!   REFUSED. The mutation is built CONSTRUCTIVELY here and asserted to have changed the value
//!   before the verdict is read, so this cannot decay into a no-op falsifier;
//! * **THE `cipherclerk` BOUNDARY**: a committed turn whose artifact this node did not mint serves
//!   `proof_commit_status: "absent"` and a null pair, which is what makes the checker refuse
//!   rather than serve a wrong pair. A ledgerless producer cannot compute this chain's
//!   whole-ledger rotation context, so there is no honest pair for its artifacts and none is
//!   invented.
//!
//! ## What this exhibit does NOT establish, stated here so the file cannot be read as more
//!
//! The served pair is **node-derived, not committee-signed**. The committee signs
//! `TurnReceipt::{pre,post}_state_hash`, a DIFFERENT commitment of the same transition — see
//! `turn/tests/receipt_state_commit_is_not_the_proof_state_commit.rs`. So a hostile NODE can still
//! serve a forged artifact beside a matching forged pair; what it can no longer do is serve an
//! artifact whose own published commitments contradict what its commit path derived, and no
//! checker anywhere reads the expected pair out of the object it is judging.
//!
//! ## Why the durable state is seeded rather than driven through consensus
//!
//! Same reason as `turn_anchor_binds_a_proof_to_the_committee.rs`: reaching
//! `execute_finalized_turn` needs a live blocklace quorum, and what is under test is the CUSTODY
//! of the pair — derived at commit time, persisted, served, bound — not the consensus round. The
//! seed writes exactly the objects and keys the finalized path writes, so a drift between this
//! seed and the production writer shows up as an endpoint that serves no pair.
