//! One application-payload admission predicate — and one admission STAGING RUN —
//! for every `SignedTurn` ingress.
//!
//! Consensus authentication proves which validator carried a payload; it does
//! not authorize the payload's agent, so every ingress runs
//! [`validate_signed_turn`] before the turn can reach the authoritative ledger.
//!
//! # What each ingress actually does — MEASURED, not intended
//!
//! The previous version of this docblock said this module "prevents a new
//! transport from accidentally implementing a weaker subset", named three
//! transports, and claimed validation runs "before any ledger mutation". Every
//! one of those clauses was false at the time it was read (2026-08-06), and the
//! interesting falsehood was not weakness but STRICTNESS — see below. So this
//! block states the arrangement rather than an aspiration, and the arrangement is
//! now enforced by a shared function instead of by this paragraph.
//!
//! **The five production `validate_signed_turn` call sites**, and what surrounds
//! each:
//!
//! | site | what it is | staging run |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `api::post_submit_turn` | `POST /turn/submit`, node-signed thin ingress | [`stage_signed_turn_admission`] |
//! | `api::submit_signed_turn` | `POST /turns/submit` + `POST /api/poa/signal/{a}/claims` | [`stage_signed_turn_admission`] |
//! | `api::post_faucet` | node-built faucet envelope | its own (pipelined-nonce delta, below) |
//! | `api::post_aggregate_bundle` | `POST /turns/aggregate` | none — proves, never executes |
//! | `blocklace_sync::execute_finalized_turn` | consensus finalization — THE AUTHORITY | its own (isolated clone) |
//! | `submit_queue_drainer::execute_submission` | pg `dregg.submit_queue`, `pg-mirror-live` ONLY | [`stage_signed_turn_admission`] |
//!
//! ⓘ `private_dependent_turns` calls the predicate twice more (arming, and
//! release) as READ-LOCK PRE-CHECKS. They mutate nothing and execute nothing;
//! they exist so a turn is not sealed into custody that the ingress which will
//! actually apply it would refuse. They deliberately use the pure
//! [`claimed_actor_cell`] rather than the mutating claim.
//!
//! ⓘ The drainer is `#![cfg(feature = "pg-mirror-live")]` and `node/Cargo.toml`
//! declares **no `default` feature at all**, so that transport does not exist in
//! a default build. Do not read its row as describing a shipped ingress.
//!
//! ⚠ **The predicate does NOT run before every ledger mutation, and the old
//! docblock's claim that it did was false.** [`claim_signer_actor_cell`] WRITES
//! to the live ledger and must run FIRST on the write-lock ingresses, because the
//! predicate resolves authority against the LIVE agent cell and a fresh or
//! faucet-stubbed client has none that binds its signer. Every such write is
//! inside an armed restore point, so it is O(touched)-reversible and a refused
//! turn leaves the ledger byte-identical — but "recoverable" is not "before any
//! mutation", and stating the stronger thing is how a reader stops checking.
//! Finalization is the one path that genuinely does not write first: it uses the
//! pure [`claimed_actor_cell`] and installs the result on an isolated clone,
//! because a claim in authoritative RAM that no commit record carries is an
//! attested-root split.
//!
//! ⓘ **The boundary of this module's guarantee.** It covers ingresses that STAGE
//! a `SignedTurn` and predict finalization's verdict. Three other places call
//! `executor_setup::execute_via_producer` on a `Turn` and are NOT covered:
//! `api::post_resolve_conditional` (a stored pending conditional, committed
//! locally), `mcp::handlers_act` (the operator's own MCP `act` surface), and
//! `exact_fnsp_v3_execution_authority`. None of them provisions Transfer
//! destinations either, so a conditional or MCP transfer to an unseen cell hits
//! the same executor refusal. They are a different question — they commit rather
//! than stage — and they are named here so this block is not read as covering
//! them.
//!
//! # ⚑ The split this module was reorganised to kill: STRICTER, not weaker
//!
//! `POST /turn/submit` and the pg drainer used to execute their staging run
//! against a ledger that had NOT had [`install_pre_execution_state`] applied —
//! specifically, without `blocklace_sync::provision_transfer_destinations`. A
//! `Transfer` to a destination cell nobody has seen yet is refused by the
//! executor as `transfer destination not found` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs`),
//! so those two ingresses answered a TERMINAL REFUSAL for a turn that
//! `POST /turns/submit` accepts and that finalization commits — on the same node,
//! at the same instant, for byte-identical effects. The drainer wrote
//! `status='refused'` into `dregg.submit_queue` and never handed the envelope to
//! consensus at all.
//!
//! That is a LIVENESS SPLIT between transports on one chain, and it protected
//! nothing: finalization provisions unconditionally and is the sole authoritative
//! application, so the strict ingresses refused turns the chain then had no
//! objection to. The gate set that is correct is **finalization's**, because
//! finalization is the only run whose verdict is binding; a staging run exists to
//! PREDICT that verdict, and a prediction made against a ledger finalization will
//! never produce is not a stricter check, it is a wrong one.
//!
//! # How parity is held now
//!
//! [`stage_signed_turn_admission`] is the single staging run: claim → predicate →
//! receipt continuity → [`install_pre_execution_state`] → the one executor gate →
//! unconditional rollback. A transport does not get to choose the steps or their
//! order; it chooses only how to render the refusal. [`install_pre_execution_state`]
//! is the SAME function `execute_finalized_turn` calls on its isolated candidate
//! ledger, so "what the ledger must look like before this turn runs" has exactly
//! one definition and staging cannot drift from finalization.
//!
//! The two remaining deltas are deliberate and stated here rather than implied:
//!
//! * **the faucet** builds its own envelope and must reflect a PIPELINED nonce
//!   (`faucet_reserved_nonce`) inside the journal between provisioning and
//!   execution, so it keeps its own sequence. It runs the same predicate and the
//!   same provisioning; it skips the claim, which would be a no-op (the faucet
//!   cell is genesis-minted and already its signer's canonical account).
//! * **finalization** decides the claim with the pure [`claimed_actor_cell`]
//!   BEFORE validation and installs it on an isolated clone, because a finalized
//!   payload can clear this whole perimeter and still be refused afterwards; a
//!   claim written into authoritative RAM would then survive in RAM only and
//!   split the attested root. It applies ~15 further deterministic-rejection
//!   gates no ingress runs (the PoA Signal/galley classifiers, the
//!   faithful-note/nullifier suite, `exact-fnsp-v3-carrier-refused`). Those are
//!   refusals, and an ingress that skips them is merely optimistic: the turn is
//!   admitted, reaches consensus, and is deterministically rejected there. That
//!   direction costs a block, not safety.

///    whose destination is absent (`TurnError::TransferDestNotFound`), and no node
///    holds the destination's pre-image, so every node materialises a zero-pk stub
///    at the destination id. ⚑ Deterministic in (turn, PRE-STATE), not in the turn
///    alone — the stub's ASSET is read from the Transfer's source cell in the local
///    ledger, because a Transfer is a single-asset move and the turn does not carry
///    the asset. See `blocklace_sync::provision_transfer_destinations` for why that
///    is enough for cross-node uniformity, and for the absent-source skip.
///    Finalization does this unconditionally; a staging run that omits it is not
///    predicting finalization's verdict, it is answering a different question about
///    a ledger that will never exist.
