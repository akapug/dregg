//! Economic slash loop — from a proven custody fault to a seized bond.
//!
//! This module WELDS three parts that already exist independently:
//!
//!   1. the referee — [`dregg_captp::custody::adjudicate_from_inbox`], the
//!      crypto-sound, reorg-robust verdict (`slash` iff a well-formed receipt +
//!      the inbox cell shows the box was never delivered and never refunded);
//!   2. the executor-enforced slash transition —
//!      [`dregg_storage_templates::relay_operator::build_slash_action`], which
//!      decrements `BOND_AMOUNT_SLOT` while advancing `DISPUTE_COUNT_SLOT` by
//!      exactly one (`BoundedBy{bond,dispute}` + `FieldDelta{dispute,+1}`); and
//!   3. the relay service HTTP surface (`relay_service.rs`), which had no
//!      dispute/slash route.
//!
//! The loop is **bilateral**: an owner-anchored fraud proof (the relay's OWN
//! signed [`dregg_captp::custody::CustodyReceipt`] against the inbox cell's
//! authenticated state), NOT a global-consensus vote.
//!
//! # What is REAL here
//!
//!   * [`referee_then_plan`] runs the real referee and, on a slash verdict,
//!     computes a [`SlashPlan`] whose seizure is capped by the bond floor
//!     (`bond_min`) — the same floor the relay-operator slash transition
//!     enforces.
//!   * [`build_slash_turn`] drives the real [`build_slash_action`] and appends
//!     the effects that dispose of the seized bond FROM the relay cell: a
//!     bounded RESTITUTION [`Effect::Transfer`] to the wronged inbox owner
//!     (their proven loss + a small bounty), and the REMAINDER as a conserving
//!     [`Effect::Transfer`] to the configured remainder destination
//!     ([`default_slash_treasury`] by default). The bond leaves the operator in
//!     full (`restitution + remainder == seized`); nothing is destroyed.
//!     `build_slash_action` deliberately omits these (its doc: "the accompanying
//!     `Effect::Transfer` … is the cclerk-side composition"); this is that
//!     composition. Restitution makes the wronged party whole; the remainder is a
//!     public fault-beacon + funding flywheel at a deployment-chosen cell (an OSS
//!     fund, a lottery among grain-owners, or a burn address) — never a windfall
//!     to the disputer, never a protocol-governed entity.
//!   * [`handle_dispute`] is the `POST /relay/dispute` intake: it gates on the
//!     referee's own `well_formed`, reads the inbox cell (the content-addressed
//!     delivered set is the service's `delivery_proofs` cache), runs the referee,
//!     and on a slash applies the transition to the in-process template mirror
//!     (bond down, dispute +1 — the same slot moves the ledger action encodes).
//!
//! # What still needs promotion (honest gaps)
//!
//!   * **Emitting the signed ledger turn from the route.** [`build_slash_turn`]
//!     produces the real [`Action`] (bond/dispute `SetField`s + the conserving
//!     restitution `Transfer` + the conserving remainder `Transfer`), and it is
//!     unit-tested with a test
//!     cipherclerk. The legacy in-process [`crate::relay_service::RelayState`]
//!     holds no [`AppCipherclerk`], no governance slash capability, and no minted
//!     relay-operator `CellId`, so the route mutates the MIRROR and reports the
//!     plan rather than submitting a signed turn. Promotion = give `RelayState`
//!     the operator's clerk + the real relay `CellId`, then call
//!     [`build_slash_turn`] and submit through the operator's turn pipeline.
//!   * **Cell-program intake now exists; this route is mirror-only.** The
//!     dispute intake on the cell-program path is
//!     [`crate::relay_slash_intake::intake_dispute`]: on a conviction it
//!     produces a signed Turn invoking the relay-operator CELL's `slash`
//!     method (the [`dregg_storage_templates::relay_operator`]
//!     executor-enforced transition) with the conserving payout composed in,
//!     and it is tested end-to-end against an executor with the cell program
//!     installed. The legacy `POST /relay/dispute` below remains the
//!     deprecated in-process view (it mutates the MIRROR only); wiring the
//!     intake turn into the node's live turn-submission pipeline is the
//!     remaining seam.
//!   * **The refund witness.** The in-process service has no per-message refund
//!     record queryable by `content_hash`, so [`handle_dispute`] passes
//!     `refund_recorded = false` to
//!     [`dregg_captp::custody::InboxState::from_dequeue`]. A box that was
//!     refunded (not delivered) would therefore read as `Dropped`. Production
//!     must source the refund bit from the operator's refund ledger / the cell's
//!     `refund_recorded` state. Until then a slash verdict is only sound for
//!     boxes that were genuinely neither delivered nor refunded.
//!   * The referee returns a **`bool`** (`true` = slash), NOT a magnitude: the
//!     custody model adjudicates GUILT, not a penalty. The seizure amount is a
//!     policy input ([`DEFAULT_SLASH_PENALTY`] / the disputant's request), capped
//!     by the bond floor.
