//! committee_replay.rs — boot-time derivation of the CURRENT federation
//! committee from the persisted blocklace: the constitution as a PURE VIEW of
//! the chain, never a second source of truth.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. Membership is amended ON-CHAIN (`MembershipAction` blocks →
//! quorum votes → `blocklace_sync::apply_passed_proposal` → the live epoch
//! transition), and the `federation_id` is INTENTIONALLY stable across
//! amendments so bots / bridges / light clients never re-point. But the runtime
//! `ConstitutionManager` was rebuilt fresh from the genesis committee on every
//! boot, and the executed-identity cursor (correctly, for turns) never re-serves
//! already-executed membership blocks — so a restart silently REVERTED the
//! committee to genesis: an admitted validator's finalization votes stopped
//! counting, the threshold regressed, and the signed-anchor recovery check
//! (`state.rs::verify_signed_anchor_and_rollback`, the N3 Fix-B weld) verified a
//! root quorum-signed by the AMENDED committee against the genesis key set —
//! fail-closing an honest node. That reversion is why operator adds still
//! leaned on the disruptive genesis re-roll. This module closes it: the boot
//! committee is DERIVED from the finalized membership history, so the amended
//! committee survives restart and the re-roll becomes a recovery tool, not the
//! join path.
//!
//! HOW. [`derive_from_lace`] folds the finalized membership blocks over a fresh
//! `ConstitutionManager`, in the same order the executor served them: the
//! `ordering::tau` order computed with the committee AS OF each amendment.
//! Because tau's leader election depends on the participant set, each applied
//! amendment triggers an order recompute, and the walk continues over the
//! not-yet-folded identities — exactly the shifting-order-absorbed-by-identity
//! discipline the live executor's cursor uses (`TauPrefixMonotone`). The loop
//! terminates: every recompute is preceded by a fresh amendment, and amendments
//! are bounded by the membership blocks in the lace.
//!
//! The fold itself ([`fold_membership_block`]) is the PURE twin of
//! `blocklace_sync::execute_finalized_membership` — proposal registration, the
//! proposer's implicit self-vote, Approve/Reject votes, quorum application. No
//! gossip, no devnet auto-approve, no live reconfigure. Replay can never widen
//! authority: every vote counted here was a signed, finalized on-chain block,
//! and eligibility is enforced by the same `ConstitutionManager` quorum rule
//! the live path uses.
