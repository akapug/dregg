//! Submit-seam closure for the cell-program slash intake — the intake turn
//! rides the node's OWN turn-submit pipeline.
//!
//! [`crate::relay_slash_intake::intake_dispute`] ends at a named seam: on a
//! conviction it returns a SIGNED, nonce-0 [`Turn`] invoking the
//! relay-operator cell's `slash` method, and its module docs say the
//! caller's turn pipeline sets the real nonce and ships it. This module is
//! that caller for a NODE deployment: [`prepare_slash_submit`] finalizes the
//! intake turn against the node's LIVE state (nonce off the acting cell,
//! expiry stamp, fee sized by the SAME estimator the submit executor
//! charges, receipt-chain binding) and signs it into the canonical
//! [`SignedTurn`] envelope — byte-for-byte the body `POST /turns/submit`
//! consumes (`postcard::to_stdvec(&SignedTurn)`; see
//! `api.rs::post_submit_signed_turn`).
//!
//! # What is REAL vs the remaining hop (honest scope)
//!
//! REAL — the tests below drive the ACTUAL route: they boot a solo
//! [`crate::state::NodeState`], install the relay-operator template
//! `CellProgram` on a relay cell in the node's authoritative ledger, run the
//! real referee via `intake_dispute`, finalize + sign here, and POST the
//! envelope through the axum router to `/turns/submit` — the same handler a
//! remote client hits, with every ingress gate live (ed25519 + fail-closed
//! PQ half over the turn hash, the signer↔agent binding,
//! actor/destination provisioning, the ONE producer gate
//! `executor_setup::execute_via_producer`, solo commit + receipt-chain
//! append). The relay cell's bond/dispute slots advance and the conserving
//! payout lands, enforced by the installed cell program in the node's
//! executor — nothing is re-implemented or mirrored here.
//!
//! THE REMAINING HOP — transport only. A deployment whose intake process is
//! not the node process still has to carry [`PreparedSlashSubmit::envelope`]
//! to the node's HTTP ingress (an ordinary `POST /turns/submit` with
//! `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`); an in-process embedder hands
//! it to the router exactly as the tests do. Nothing in that hop re-signs or
//! re-decides — the envelope is complete and the node's gates are the
//! authority.
//!
//! Nothing here weakens authorization: this module only finalizes fields the
//! executor checks anyway (nonce, expiry, fee, chain head) and signs with
//! the intake cipherclerk. Which authorization the DEPLOYED relay cell
//! demands for `slash` remains executor-enforced deployment configuration;
//! an unauthorized intake turn is rejected by the pipeline like any other.
//! The loop stays bilateral and owner-anchored: the conviction is the
//! intake's own referee run against authenticated inbox state, and the node
//! that executes it is the (deployment-chosen) node hosting the
//! relay-operator cell — no global-consensus vote, no global-owned entity.
