//! The node-side submit-queue DRAINER — the READ side of pg-dregg's write loop
//! (`.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §11.4, M3), symmetric to the WRITE side in
//! [`crate::pg_mirror`].
//!
//! # The one gap this closes
//!
//! The §11 write outbox (`pg_dregg::mirror::ddl::write_outbox`) already ships the
//! *enqueue* half: a pg role calls `dregg_submit_turn(signed_turn, agent)` and a
//! row lands in `dregg.submit_queue` with `status='pending'`, RLS-gated so a role
//! enqueues only the turns its capability admits `submit` on. What was missing was
//! the half that closes the loop: a row's `status` never walked
//! `pending → executed | refused`, because nothing *drained* the queue. This
//! module is that drainer. It is the node-side tail that:
//!
//! 1. `LISTEN`s on the `dregg_submit_queue` notify channel (low latency) AND
//!    periodically sweeps the `submit_queue_pending` partial index (a safety net
//!    so a notification lost across a reconnect, or a row enqueued while the
//!    drainer was down, is still drained — a node restart resumes from the
//!    `pending` rows, losing nothing);
//! 2. for each pending row, `postcard`-decodes the `signed_turn` bytes into a
//!    [`dregg_sdk::SignedTurn`] and runs the SAME admission gates the node's
//!    `POST /turns/submit` handler runs (signature over the turn hash,
//!    agent-derivation, receipt-chain), then executes it through THE ONE executor
//!    gate ([`crate::executor_setup::execute_via_producer`], #171) — the verified
//!    Lean producer is authoritative exactly as for an HTTP-submitted turn;
//! 3. writes the outcome back in one `UPDATE`:
//!    `status='executed', receipt_hash=…, resolved_at=now()` on commit, or
//!    `status='refused', error=…` on rejection.
//!
//! # The spine invariant (preserved)
//!
//! > **Reads are free SQL; state mutates ONLY through verified turns.**
//!
//! Postgres never executes — `dregg_submit_turn` only *records an intent*. The
//! drainer hands that intent to the REAL verified executor (the same one every
//! ingress uses), so the executor stays the sole trust boundary; the drainer is
//! plumbing, not a second semantics. A queued turn the executor rejects is
//! recorded `refused` and changes no state. The post-state cell projection into
//! the `dregg.*` mirror tables is NOT this module's job: it rides the existing
//! commit-path mirror ([`crate::state::NodeStateInner::mirror_committed_record`])
//! when the executed turn reaches finality, exactly as a locally-submitted turn's
//! post-state does — duplicating it here would fight the M2 [`crate::pg_mirror`]
//! `RootChain` ordinal discipline. The drainer's load-bearing contract is solely
//! "execute the queued intent through the real executor and resolve the row."
//!
//! # Opt-in, off by default
//!
//! The drainer connects ONLY when `pg-mirror-live` is built AND
//! `DREGG_PG_MIRROR_URL` is set — the same on/off switch the [`crate::pg_mirror`]
//! WRITE side uses ([`crate::pg_mirror::PgMirrorConfig::from_env`]). With the flag
//! unset the node behaves byte-identically: [`spawn`] returns `None` and no task
//! runs. The drainer reads the queue as the `dregg_kernel` role (the role the §11
//! DDL grants `SELECT, UPDATE` on `dregg.submit_queue`, and which must hold
//! BYPASSRLS to read every pending row regardless of submitter) — the connection
//! URL is expected to authenticate as that role.
