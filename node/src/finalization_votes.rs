//! Quorum finalization votes — the explicit signed-vote agreement layer.
//!
//! # Why this exists (the soundness gap it closes)
//!
//! The blocklace finality executor computes finality **unilaterally per node**:
//! each node runs `ordering::tau` over its own view of the DAG and decides "this
//! block is Ordered" on its own. At n=1 (solo) that is the whole story. At n≥2 a
//! node that has locally finalized a block cannot, from the DAG alone, *know*
//! that the rest of the committee agrees it is final — the DAG-derived ack count
//! (`FinalityTracker::record_ack`) is still a function of THIS node's view.
//!
//! This module adds the missing message exchange: when a node finalizes a
//! turn-bearing block locally (it reaches `Ordered`, which subsumes local
//! `Attested`), it gossips a **signed** [`FinalizationVote`] (carried as a
//! `BlocklaceGossipMessage::FinalizationVote` on the blocklace topic — the
//! proven-bidirectional dissemination channel). Every node collects votes keyed
//! by *distinct verified signer* and only declares a block **consensus-wide
//! Attested** once it holds `2f+1` distinct-signer votes for it. That is the
//! step from "I think it is final" to "a quorum has signed that it is final": a
//! portable, verifiable certificate of agreement rather than a per-node guess.
//!
//! The collector is a pure value (no I/O), so the threshold-gating logic is
//! exercised by unit tests without a running node (see the tests at the bottom).
//! The gossip wiring lives in [`crate::blocklace_sync`].
