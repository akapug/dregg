//! transport_parity_e2e.rs — DO TWO INGRESSES ON THE SAME NODE ANSWER THE SAME?
//!
//! `signed_turn_validation` exists so every `SignedTurn` transport reaches one
//! verdict. Until 2026-08-06 its docblock ASSERTED that and nothing checked it,
//! and the way it was false is the reason this file exists: the failure was not a
//! transport that checked too little, it was a transport that checked something
//! ELSE and refused a turn the chain commits.
//!
//! # The split, concretely
//!
//! `blocklace_sync::provision_transfer_destinations` materialises a deterministic
//! zero-pk stub for any `Transfer` destination no node has seen — the recipient's
//! public key is not carried over consensus, so every node mints the identical
//! landing site from the turn's own data. `execute_finalized_turn` does this
//! UNCONDITIONALLY before it executes, and the executor refuses a `Transfer` whose
//! destination is absent (`TurnError::TransferDestNotFound`).
//!
//! `POST /turns/submit` provisioned before its staging execution. `POST
//! /turn/submit` did not. So on ONE node, at one instant, for the same effect:
//!
//! * `/turns/submit` → `accepted: true`, the turn enters consensus, finalization
//!   provisions the destination and credits it; and
//! * `/turn/submit`  → `accepted: false, "rejected: transfer destination not
//!   found: …"` — terminal, never submitted, nothing to retry.
//!
//! The pg `submit_queue` drainer had the same omission with a worse ending: it
//! wrote `status='refused'` into the queue row. (That transport is
//! `pg-mirror-live`-only; its half of this proof lives in
//! `submit_queue_drainer.rs` so it runs under the feature that compiles it.)
//!
//! ⚑ WHICH SIDE WAS WRONG. The strict one. A staging run exists to PREDICT
//! finalization's verdict — finalization is the sole authoritative application —
//! so a prediction computed against a ledger finalization will never produce is
//! not a stricter check, it is a wrong one. And it guarded nothing: the identical
//! turn walked in through the other door and committed. The repair is therefore
//! `signed_turn_validation::install_pre_execution_state`, called by finalization
//! AND by the one shared staging run every ingress now takes.
//!
//! THE CANARY (cheap, and it is the whole point): delete the
//! `install_pre_execution_state` call from
//! `signed_turn_validation::stage_signed_turn_admission` and
//! [`the_two_http_turn_ingresses_agree_on_a_transfer_to_a_fresh_destination`]
//! goes red on the `/turn/submit` half with `transfer destination not found`,
//! while the `/turns/submit` half stays green — which is exactly the shape of the
//! defect, reproduced.
