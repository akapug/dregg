//! Verified FINALITY GATE — gate the live commit on the Lean-exported finalization rule.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! `blocklace_sync::poll_finalized_blocks` computes the finalized total order with the Rust
//! `dregg_blocklace::ordering::tau` and serves the not-yet-executed blocks (tracked BY IDENTITY in
//! `crate::execution_cursor::ExecutionCursor`; see TauPrefixMonotone) to the executor. The
//! verified Lean model of that rule (`metatheory/Dregg2/Distributed/BlocklaceFinality.lean`:
//! `computeRounds`/`findAllFinalLeaders`/`tauOrder`) was, until now, only AGREEMENT-CHECKED in a
//! unit test (`ordering::tests::test_tau_differential_against_lean_model`). It did NOT gate the live
//! commit.
//!
//! This module converts "agreement-checked" into "Lean-gated". At commit time it:
//!   1. wire-encodes the SAME `(wavelength, participants, lace)` the Rust `tau` consumes, using the
//!      grammar `Dregg2.Distributed.FinalityGate.encodeLaceWire` mirrors byte-for-byte;
//!   2. calls the verified Lean rule via the FFI export `dregg_blocklace_finalize`
//!      (`dregg_lean_ffi::shadow_blocklace_finalize`), which runs `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder` and
//!      returns the verified finalized order projected to `(creator, seq)` (the differential
//!      coordinate — the `BlockId` hash differs Rust↔Lean, but `(creator, seq)` is content-identical);
//!   3. exposes [`VerifiedFinality::admits`] — "the verified rule finalizes this `(creator, seq)`" —
//!      so `poll_finalized_blocks` admits a block to the executor ONLY when the verified rule
//!      finalizes it.
//!
//! The Lean theorem `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes` proves `admits` is EXACTLY membership in the
//! verified `tauGolden` order, so gating on it IS gating on the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`.
//!
//! # Flag + fail-safety
//!
//! Gated by [`finality_gate_enabled`] (`DREGG_FINALITY_GATE`, **default ON**). When the archive HAS
//! the export and the rule disagrees with the Rust `tau` on a `(creator, seq)`, the gate REFUSES that
//! block (it is not sliced to the executor) and records the divergence — the verified rule wins.
//!
//! ⚑ **FAILS CLOSED when the gate cannot answer.** This is a CORRECTION: until
//! `blocklace_sync::finality_belt_disposition` landed, a missing export / `ERR` wire / panicked FFI
//! thread made the gate a NO-OP WITH A WARNING and the poll advanced finality over the **un-gated**
//! Rust tau order — the same fail-OPEN class as the conservation twin
//! (`turn/src/executor/atomic.rs`'s `ConservationGateUnavailable`). [`VerifiedFinality::compute`]
//! still collapses every failure to `None`; what changed is the CALLER's disposition: a `None` where
//! the belt is armed now REFUSES to advance finality (finalize nothing this poll, re-attempt later)
//! unless one of two DECLARED bypasses holds — no `dregg_blocklace_finalize` export linked at all, or
//! the operator's `DREGG_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CONSENSUS=1`. `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` revokes both. The
//! bypasses are declared in `scripts/ci-invariants/gate-dataflow.tsv` (invariant 6), which slices
//! the disposition and reddens if the gate-absent path can admit.
//!
//! # ⚑ The enrollment repair — the rule now knows WHO IS ENROLLED
//!
//! [`VerifiedFinality::admits`] used to document that an unenrolled key "is never interned and
//! never admitted". Both halves were false, and
//! `tests::attacker_block_from_unenrolled_creator_is_refused_by_the_verified_rule` FAILED on it:
//! the verified rule finalized 100% of a 4-creator lace with 3 enrolled, including all three of
//! the unenrolled creator's blocks. The rule consulted `participants` for the round-robin leader
//! schedule and the supermajority count, and NEVER for who may be ordered at all.
//!
//! REACHABILITY — this was NOT only defence-in-depth. `receive_block_pinned`'s
//! `BlockError::UnenrolledCreator` is the sole enrollment filter on the live ingest path, and two
//! production paths get past it without any attack on it:
//!   * **rotation-out.** The pinned roster is INSERT-ONLY (`blocklace/src/finality.rs::enroll_pq`;
//!     `blocklace_sync.rs::apply_committee_change` says so outright) while
//!     `constitution.current.participants` SHRINKS on a passed membership proposal
//!     (`blocklace_sync.rs::apply_passed_proposal`). A removed validator's NEW blocks keep passing
//!     the pinned ingest while it is absent from the `participants` slice this gate is handed —
//!     the falsifier's exact configuration, reached by an ordinary governance action.
//!   * **restart.** `blocklace/src/finality.rs::from_checkpoint`, reached from
//!     `blocklace_sync.rs`'s boot `store.load_blocklace`, re-authenticates every block on restore
//!     (ed25519 signature + causal closure + equivocation re-derived, since 2026-08-08 — it was
//!     the verbatim `from_checkpoint_trusted` before that) but still enforces NO roster check:
//!     an unenrolled creator's validly-signed blocks come back.
//!
//! THE FIX is in the verified rule, in Lean, where the rule lives:
//! `BlocklaceFinality.enrolledId` + `tauOrder`/`tauOrderFast`/`tauOrderFastImpl`, with
//! `tauOrder_only_enrolled` (every finalized block's creator is a participant, NO hypothesis on
//! the lace) and `tauOrder_enrolled_eq_unfiltered` (on an all-enrolled lace the filter is the
//! identity — a pure subtraction, not a liveness trade). `blocklace/src/ordering.rs::tau` carries
//! the mirror so the live per-poll Rust↔Lean differential stays silent on an attacked lace.

    ///   * ROTATION-OUT. The pinned roster is INSERT-ONLY (`blocklace/src/finality.rs::enroll_pq`;
    ///     `blocklace_sync.rs::apply_committee_change` states it) while
    ///     `constitution.current.participants` shrinks on a passed membership proposal

    ///     constitution every poll. A removed validator's NEW blocks keep passing the pinned ingest
    ///     while it is absent from the `participants` this gate is handed — exactly the lace below,
    ///     produced by governance rather than by an attacker.
    ///   * RESTART. `blocklace/src/finality.rs::from_checkpoint` rebuilds the lace from redb —
    ///     re-authenticated since 2026-08-08 (signature + closure + equivocation), but still with
    ///     NO roster check: an unenrolled creator's validly-signed blocks come back.
