//! Canonical shared types for the dregg federation protocol.

//! and other crates.
//!
//! # Key invariants
//!
//! - [`Signature`] is ALWAYS 64 bytes (Ed25519).
//! - [`PublicKey`] is ALWAYS 32 bytes (Ed25519).
//! - [`AttestedRoot`] carries `Vec<(PublicKey, Signature)>` with correct sizes.

// =============================================================================
// Hybrid post-quantum identity commitment
// =============================================================================
//
// The pre-quantum audit (2026-07-09) closed every load-bearing SIGNATURE surface
// to a hybrid `ed25519 ∧ ML-DSA-65`, but the identities those surfaces speak for
// (`CellId`, `FederationId`, the wire participant node-id) were ed25519-ONLY:
// they did not cryptographically commit to the ML-DSA key, so the PQ key had to
// be ENROLLED OUT-OF-BAND (a separate roster table, pinned by the caller). That
// left a gap — nothing in the identity itself forced a presented ML-DSA key to
// be the RIGHT one.
//
// The fix below makes the identity BE the enrollment: a hybrid id is the
// domain-separated BLAKE3 hash of BOTH public keys, so the ML-DSA key is a
// derivable function of the id, not a side table. A verifier recomputes the
// commitment from the two presented keys and REJECTS any ML-DSA key that does
// not hash into the claimed id (`verify_committed_ml_dsa`). This is the
// cryptographic enroll+pin.
//
// `dregg-types` deliberately takes NO post-quantum crypto dependency (no
// `fips204` / `dregg-pq`) — it hashes the ML-DSA public-key BYTES only. The
// ML-DSA key handling itself lives in `dregg-pq`; callers pass the serialized
// public key (`MlDsaPublicKey.0`, 1952 bytes for ML-DSA-65) as `ml_dsa_pk`.
