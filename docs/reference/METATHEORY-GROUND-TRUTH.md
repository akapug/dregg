# METATHEORY GROUND TRUTH — read this BEFORE modeling anything in Lean

> **STOP.** If you are about to model the effect-VM, the circuit/STARK, the kernel state, capabilities, or
> turn soundness in Lean — **they already exist.** This file says where. Modeling them fresh produces a
> *mirror*: a real theorem about a fake object, which then gets described as a theorem about the real system.
> That has happened (2026-07-09; see the HORIZONLOG **RETRACTION** entry and
> `memory/feedback-integrator-must-not-compress-scope`).

## The rule
Before writing `inductive Effect` / `def applyEff` / `def verifyCore` / any `KernelCap`, grep this tree first.
Then paste the **real signatures and absolute paths** into any subagent prompt. Prose invites reconstruction.

## Where the real models live

### The effect algebra + the real state
- **`Dregg2/Exec/RecordKernel.lean:309` — `structure RecordKernelState`** (the real state: `cell`, `bal`, …).
- **`Dregg2/Circuit/Argus/Stmt.lean:102` — `def interp : RecStmt → RecordKernelState → Option RecordKernelState`**
  — the real interpreter.
- **`Dregg2/Circuit/Argus/Effects/` — 29 files**, one per real effect: `CreateCell`, `Mint`, `Burn`,
  `NoteSpend`, `NoteCreate`, `Delegate`, `DelegateAtten`, `Attenuate`, `ExerciseViaCapability`, `CellSeal`,
  `CellUnseal`, `CellDestroy`, `MakeSovereign`, `BridgeMint`, `Introduce`, `EmitEvent`, `IncrementNonce`, …
- Per-effect soundness against the kernel, e.g. `Stmt.lean:174 interp_transferStmt_eq_recKExec`,
  `:258 interp_mintStmt_eq_recKMint`, `:272 interp_burnStmt_eq_recKBurn`,
  `Effects/MakeSovereign.lean:193 interp_makeSovereignStmt_eq_kernel`.
- The deployed Rust `Effect` enum has **34 variants** (`turn/src/action.rs:1061`), applied by
  `apply_effect_to_cell` (`turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:1332`). Any Lean `Effect` with six constructors over a
  scalar is **not** it.

### The circuit / turn-soundness apex
- **`Dregg2/Circuit/CircuitSoundness.lean:750` — `turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`**
  `(hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (S : CommitSurface) (R : Registry) (c : TurnDecodeChain hash S start fin)`
  `(href : StepsRefine hash S R c) : ∃ acts : List FullActionA, turnSpec start acts fin`
  — the decoded turn chain **refines the turn spec**. Also `:813 turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec_gen`.
- Closure: `Dregg2/Circuit/CircuitSoundnessAssembled.lean:677 hrefinesAll`,
  `Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureAll.lean:1596 hrefinesAllClosed`, `Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureForest.lean:101`.
- Effects↔circuit: 20 files under `Dregg2/Circuit/Argus/` reference `Surface2` (e.g. `createCellCircuit`).

### THE CARRIED OBLIGATIONS (what the apex names, and where each stands)
`CircuitSoundness.lean`'s header names the apex's explicit hypotheses:
1. **`[StarkSound]`** — soundness of the deployed STARK verifier. **DISCHARGED at the deployed
   registry**: `algoStarkSound_kernel` (`Dregg2/Circuit/AlgoStarkSoundKernel.lean`) supplies
   `StarkSound hash Rfix`, and the FRI-LDT floor is instantiated at the **deployed** field/rate/query
   count (`BabyBearFriDeployedInstance.lean`; `FriLdtJohnson.friLdtDeployedBound_discharge`,
   axiom-clean). Orient from `docs/reference/STARK-SOUNDNESS-CENSUS.md` for the floor's exact shape;
   the `L>1` list-decoding content is DISCHARGED at the deployed code: `rsListBound_johnson_112`
   proves `RSListBound (codeC 6 ω) 112 15` at the Johnson radius (`FriLdtJohnsonList.lean`, no
   axiom, no sorry), and the BCIKS20 δ-preserving correlated-agreement primitive is closed by
   ordered-pair counting (`wrap_correlatedAgreement_sharp_proved : WrapCorrelatedAgreementSharp 292`;
   `wrap_perFold_soundness_capacity` — the ~112.6-bit per-fold bound, carried to the deployed
   arity-8 posture at ~109.84 bits by `FriArityTransfer.lean`).
2. **`[Poseidon2SpongeCR hash]`** — Poseidon2-sponge collision resistance (`Dregg2/Circuit/Poseidon2Binding.lean`).
   The named crypto floor; it stays a hypothesis (a standard CR assumption, not Lean-provable).
3. Per-effect carried facts: `cellLeafInjective CH`, `RestHashIffFrame RH` (hypotheses of
   `hrefines_forest_closed`, `Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureForest.lean:101`).
- Also `Dregg2/Circuit.lean` carries a `-- PRIMITIVE:` digest-binding obligation (reduced to `HashCR`).

### The crypto floor (the good part of the 07-09 work)
- `Dregg2/Crypto/HybridCombiner.lean` — `SigScheme`, `EufCma`, and the **projection** argument (a hybrid
  forgery projects to component forgeries). This one *is* about the real construction.
- `Dregg2/Crypto/IdentityCommitment.lean` — `verify_committed_ml_dsa` binding → `HashCR`. Corresponds to the
  deployed `dregg-types` function of the same name.
- `Dregg2/Crypto/HermineSelfTargetMSIS.lean`, `SchnorrEufCma.lean` — the DL/MSIS extractions.
- `Dregg2/Crypto/OneWayToHiding.lean`, `DoubleSidedO2H.lean` — a q-query QROM adversary built from
  `EuclideanSpace ℂ`; `norm_sq_sum_orthogonal` (orthogonal errors combine in quadrature) is real.
- `Dregg2/Circuit/FriSoundness.lean:250` — `fold_close_of_two_alpha`, the BBHR18 two-challenge
  reconstruction. Real lemma, **instantiated at the deployed parameters**: `BabyBear` at the wrap
  rate `1/64`, `|L|=128`, `numQueries=19` (`BabyBearFriDeployedInstance.lean`, `wrapRate_friProximity`).

### Capabilities
- `Dregg2/Crypto/CapabilityChain.lean` — the cryptographic attenuation chain (real).
- `Dregg2/Firmament/SeL4Kernel.lean` — a Lean seL4 model. **Caution:** its `Slot.rights : AuthReq` is *defined*
  to be the protocol's own authority type, so any "the two lattices coincide" claim is definitional until the
  kernel model is given an independent rights type and a mapping is *proved*.

## Known-bogus artifacts (deleted 2026-07-09, listed so they are not resurrected)
`Crypto/EffectVmSemantics.lean` (an additive counter over `ZMod 5` called "the deployed effect-VM"),
`Circuit/CircuitSoundCompose.lean` (`circuit_sound` instantiated at `ZMod 5`, `|L|=4`, error `1/5`),
`Crypto/CapWeld.lean` (`capMap c := c.rights`, definitional), `Crypto/ParameterSecurity.lean` +
`Crypto/LatticeEstimate.lean` (λ = `by decide` on ℕ, **no `∀ adversary`**, unsourced constants — `192` is the
NIST Category-3 *label*, not quantum core-SVP).

Also: `Crypto/Fips204Verify.lean`'s toy `verifyCore : ℤ → ℤ → (ℤ×ℤ×ℤ) → Bool` (`:118`) is **not** ML-DSA
(no `R_q`, no NTT, no SHAKE, no packing) — cite the toy for nothing. The deployed story is
`MlDsaVerifyReal.verifyCore` (`Fips204Verify.lean:356-442`): the FULL-DIMENSION verify (n=256 negacyclic
ring, NTT, SampleInBall/ExpandA over SHAKE, the real 1952/3309-byte codec), exported as
`dregg_fips204_verify_real` and proved (`native_decide`) to accept a genuine `fips204` v0.4.6 signature
and reject tampers (`verifyRealFFI_accepts_real` / `_rejects_tampered` / `_rejects_wrong_msg`). The node
INSTALLS it at startup as the accept/reject authority (`install_mldsa_verified_verify_core`,
`node/src/lib.rs:924`); `dregg-pq::ml_dsa_verify` consults the `fips204` crate only as a fallback when
the archive export is absent (`dregg-pq/src/mldsa.rs:509-535`), and `tests/tests/verify_routing_guard.rs`
enforces the routing. ML-KEM likewise has full-dimension Lean encaps/decaps cores installed
(`node/src/lib.rs:1013,1043`; `MlKemFips203FullDim.lean`).

## Checklist before claiming a theorem is about the deployed system
1. Read the **type** of every object in the statement. A type signature refutes a headline faster than an audit.
2. For a security bound: **where is the `∀ adversary`?** `:= by decide` on a ℕ is arithmetic, not security.
3. For "X *is* Y": was `X` **defined** to be `Y`?
4. Any "engineering, not open" caveat (NTT, hash, field size) is **load-bearing** until proven otherwise.
5. A result that would be publishable if true gets audited **before** it is celebrated.
