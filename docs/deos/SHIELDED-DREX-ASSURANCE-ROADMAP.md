# Shielded DrEX — Assurance Roadmap

The north star: a DrEX where a batch **clears over hidden commitments** and the **only public
output is a proof that a fair, conserving, valid batch happened** — nobody, not even the operator,
learns who traded, the amounts, or the allocations.

This document maps the Lean/AIR/assurance work between what exists today and that north star. For
each of the six components it gives the honest grade (PROVEN / BUILT / NEEDED), a difficulty
(S / M / L / RESEARCH), dependencies, and a citation. Then a sequence, and the single most-valuable
next step.

Grading legend:
- **PROVEN** — a machine-checked Lean theorem (its *statement* audited, not just `#assert_axioms`-clean).
- **BUILT** — a circuit/AIR or Rust artifact that runs, with tested teeth (both polarities).
- **NEEDED** — the gap, with difficulty and what it depends on.

The whole tree's soundness floor is `HashCR` (Poseidon2 sponge collision-resistance) +
`Poseidon2ChipArithSound`, with the BCIKS20 list-decoding core proved for the deployed code and the
deployed FRI provably ~112.6-bit (memory `project-linking-tower-forgery-closure`). Everything below
inherits that floor for its STARK soundness; component 6 states where the shielded objects sit on it.

## The six components at a glance

| # | Component | PROVEN | BUILT | NEEDED (gap) | Diff. | Depends on |

## 1. The ring-clearing AIR

**PROVEN.** `Market/ShieldedClearing.lean::shielded_ring_clears` — a shielded ring whose matched
cycle is `CycleValid` and settles through the verified executor is simultaneously conserving (per
asset, real ledger), fair (`RingBalanced` + every leg within its committed offer/want), and
private + no-double-spend (each leg a fresh member spend). `LedgerRealizationExt.lean::
shielded_ring_fused_clears` adds the **fusion** clause `LegFused` (the matcher's `node.offerAsset`/
`offerAmount` ARE a spent note's `asset`/`value`), with the load-bearing tooth
`legA_not_fused` (the un-fused demo leg does NOT satisfy it) and `fusedRing` non-vacuity.

**BUILT.** `circuit-prove/src/shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs` — the 2-leg, tight-cycle
ring-clearing apex. Enforces in-AIR: fusion gates (`offer_asset==asset`, `offer_amount==value`),
the `CycleValid` 2-cycle edges, the tight amount match (`offer_amount[k]==want_min[(k+1)%2]`),
distinct nullifiers (`nf₀!=nf₁` via inverse witness), Pedersen conservation, and the value-binding
recompute anchoring fusion to the spent note under Poseidon2 CR. The apex `connect`s each leg to a
real `prove_shielded_spend_leaf_with_claim`. Teeth tested: non-conserving, wraparound-mint,
out-of-range, double-spend, mis-fusion, mismatched-fold — all UNSAT.

**NEEDED.**
- **N-leg (variable-length cycles).** The AIR hard-codes `RING_LEGS = 2` and a leg-major column
  layout. Generalizing to N legs is a parameterized descriptor + the fold shape (`bind_leg_node`
  already generalizes leg-by-leg). **Difficulty M.** No new crypto; a descriptor-scaling build.
  The Lean side is already N-general (`shielded_ring_clears`/`_fused_clears` quantify over the list).
- **Partial-fill `offer ≥ want_min` inequality in-AIR.** The AIR enforces the *tight* swap
  (`offer_amount == want_min`); a genuine partial fill needs the **inequality** `offer_amount ≥
  want_min` as an in-AIR range/compare gate. The Lean partial-fill lowering is already ledger-real
  and general (`partialFill_cycle_ledger_realized`, `pricedPartialFills_conserves`, no tightness).
  **Difficulty M** — the Bignum range bedrock exists (`Dregg2.Bignum.legs_noWrap_conservation`,
  and the AIR's own `VALUE_BITS` bit-decomposition gadget); this is a compare gadget reusing it.

**Sequence note:** N-leg unlocks the app-wiring (a real DEX batch is not 2 legs); the partial-fill
inequality unlocks interior clearing. Both are M and independent of the crux (3).

---

## 2. Value-commitments in-AIR

**PROVEN.** `RealCrypto.lean::twoLeg_noWrap_conservation` + `inAir_conservation_refines_pedersen`
— a field conservation gate `Σ value_in ≡ Σ value_out (mod p)` **plus the range bound** upgrades to
integer conservation, so the in-AIR field gate refines the real group-Pedersen conservation
`ring_conserves_pedersen_list`. `pedCommit_binding` / `pedCommit_mint_refused` are the binding +
anti-mint teeth over the two-generator `pedTwoGen`.

**BUILT.** The wraparound-mint hole is **closed in-circuit**: the AIR bit-decomposes every
conservation value into `VALUE_BITS = 29` boolean columns with a compile-time `RING_LEGS·2^29 ≤ p`
no-wrap assertion (`shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs::VALUE_BITS`, `RANGE_TARGET_COLS`), tested by
`wraparound_mint_ring_is_unsat` / `out_of_range_output_is_unsat`. This moves the shielded pool's
per-output Bulletproof range proof from ATTESTED off-AIR to a CIRCUIT constraint, for the
BabyBear-scale range.

**NEEDED.**
- **Full Ristretto EC-point excess in-circuit.** The in-AIR conservation runs over the
  two-**coordinate** abstraction `pedTwoGen (v, r)`, NOT the real group point `v·G + r·H` over
  Ristretto (named residual (ii) in the AIR header, lines ~88–93). Realizing the actual curve-point
  excess `Σ(v·G + r·H) = 0` in-circuit is heavy EC-in-circuit arithmetic (foreign-field, point
  add/double, scalar mul). **Difficulty RESEARCH.** Depends on EC-in-circuit primitives the tree
  does not yet carry. Until then, binding of the coordinate abstraction to the real curve rides the
  named DLog `binding` floor + the off-AIR Schnorr excess for the blinding coordinate.
- **64-bit amount range.** One BabyBear field caps a 2-leg conserving sum near `2^30`; amounts above
  `2^29` still lean on the off-AIR Bulletproof (`pool.rs::output_range_proofs`). **Difficulty M→L** —
  a multi-limb (Bignum) in-AIR range, or accept the off-AIR Bulletproof with the weld back to Lean.

**Honest framing:** the *value-minting* soundness hole (the one that lets a batch print money) is
CLOSED in-circuit for the deployed field range. What remains is faithfulness of the coordinate
model to the real curve (a modeling-resolution upgrade, not an open mint hole) and the wider range.

## 3. ⚑ The privacy / zero-knowledge property — "nobody learns what settled" (THE CRUX)

This is the new thing and the differentiator. It must be scoped exactly, because the codebase today
proves *soundness* of the clearing (it conserves, it is fair, it cannot double-spend) but has **no
theorem stating the clearing proof is zero-knowledge over the trades**. Read the grades carefully.

**PROVEN (but abstract, not yet on the clearing object):**
- `Metatheory/Open/PerfectZK.lean` closes the **perfect/statistical** fragment of ZK
  indistinguishability *generically*: given a perfect-ZK law `hperf : ∀ s w, view s w = sim s` (the
  real verifier view equals a witness-free simulation), it proves `view_indep_of_witness : ∀ s w₁ w₂,
  view s w₁ = view s w₂` — the verifier extracts zero information about which witness was used — with
  a real teeth/non-teeth pair. **This is a template, not instantiated on the ring-clearing transcript.**
  It **deliberately does NOT touch the computational layer** (PPT adversary, negligible advantage,
  simulator against efficient distinguishers) — that stays a parameter the metatheory carries.
- `Dregg2/Privacy.lean` — the value tier (Pedersen hiding, additively homomorphic), the graph tier
  (`unlinkable` stealth, `nullifier_hides_identity`), each as an abstract hiding **carrier** bundled
  with its computational law. Again: carriers, not a clearing-level theorem.

**BUILT (mechanism present, statistical-ZK is a tested config not a proven theorem):**
- The shielded-spend circuit proves through the **hiding** uni-STARK path (`prove_dsl_zk`,
  `HidingFriPcs`, `ZK = true` — `shielded/spend_circuit.rs`, `shielded/mod.rs`). Value, owner, key,
  Merkle path, randomness, leaf commitment live **only in the witness** under the hiding PCS. The
  circuit exposes exactly **3 PIs**: `[nullifier, merkle_root, value_binding]`, where `value_binding`
  is a *hiding* Poseidon2 commitment to the value (blinded by the note randomness).
- The ring-clearing apex exposes `[nf₀, root₀, vb₀, nf₁, root₁, vb₁]` — nothing else. All plaintext
  (values, offer/want, out_val/out_blind, range bits) is witness-only.
- The shielded pool (`pool.rs`) hides value + owner + **asset type** jointly (`HiddenAssetLeg`,
  `commit_hidden_asset`), with a transcript (`pool_message`) that binds no cleartext asset type.

**NEEDED (the crux gap — state it precisely):**

A DrEX batch is fully private only when there is a **theorem that the public transcript of the
clearing is independent of the private trades** — i.e. an observer (including the operator) learns
only "a fair, conserving, valid batch of size *n* cleared," and nothing about who / amounts /
allocations. Concretely this decomposes into three obligations, none of which exists yet at the
clearing level:

1. **State the clearing-level hiding theorem.** Instantiate PerfectZK's `view`/`sim` on the actual
   ring-clearing transcript. Prove `view_indep_of_witness` for the *real* exposed transcript: the
   public output (the proof + `[nf, root, vb]` per leg) is a simulable function of only the public
   data (the committed tree roots, the fresh-nullifier set, the batch size) — **independent of the
   private trade content** (owner, value, offer/want, allocation). **Difficulty RESEARCH** — writing
   the honest statement is the hard part (what is `view`? what does `sim` get?), and it is the
   differentiator. Depends on components 1 and 2 (the transcript must be finalized first).

2. **Discharge the per-PI leakage.** The three exposed lanes must each be shown to leak nothing:
   - `nullifier` — revealed **by design** to gate double-spend. Must reduce to the
     `nullifier_hides_identity` / `unlinkable` carrier (a nullifier is unlinkable to the holder).
     Today that is an abstract `Prop`, not tied to the deployed nullifier derivation.
   - `merkle_root` — public tree state; leaks nothing beyond the anonymity set (which is the whole
     tree). Cheap once stated.
   - `value_binding` — a hiding Poseidon2 commitment; hiding rests on the randomness + `HashCR`.
     Must be stated as a hiding property, not merely "it's a hash."
   **Difficulty M** once (1) frames it; these are reductions to named carriers.

3. **The statistical-ZK of the FRI PCS itself.** `HidingFriPcs` / `ZK = true` gives statistical
   zero-knowledge of the STARK, but this is a **tested config choice, not a proven simulator theorem**
   in the tree — and PerfectZK explicitly keeps the computational/statistical simulator as a
   *parameter*. Making "the proof reveals nothing beyond its PIs" a first-class named floor (the
   HidingFriPcs statistical-ZK obligation) — or proving it — is a heavy crypto obligation.
   **Difficulty RESEARCH.** This is the floor the whole reveal-nothing claim rests on; it should be
   NAMED and graded (statistical-ZK of the deployed hiding FRI), the same way `HashCR` and the DLog
   `binding` are named, rather than left implicit in a config flag.

**Honest one-line grade for component 3:** the clearing is proved *sound and private-by-construction*
(the plaintext never leaves the witness; only `[nf, root, vb]` is exposed), and the abstract ZK
machinery exists — but **there is no theorem yet that the clearing transcript reveals nothing about
the trades.** That theorem (statement + simulator/indistinguishability + the named statistical-ZK
floor) is the crux, and it is the single highest-value differentiator to build. Do not claim
"nobody learns what settled" as *proved* until it lands; today the honest claim is "private by
construction, with the hiding property tested at the PCS layer and the reveal-nothing theorem named."

---

## 4. Membership + nullifier in-clearing

**PROVEN.** `ShieldedClearing.lean::ShieldedLeg.refines` (from `shielded_spend_claim_refines`) — a
valid shielded-spend claim `[nullifier, merkle_root, value_binding]` refines a sound VM step:
AUTHORIZED (spends a real committed member note) + NO-DOUBLE-SPEND (fresh → joins spent set → never
re-spendable). The deployed nullifier flip (memory `project-vk-epoch-nullifier-flip`) forces
membership + freshness at the deployed descriptor (`noteSpendVmDescriptor2R24`, sorted-Merkle
accumulator, `nf ∉ pre.nullifiers` via `absent` + `aafi_insert`).

**BUILT.** The apex binds each ring leg to a real spend leaf via in-circuit `connect`
(`bind_leg_node`); a leg claiming a tuple no verifying spend backs is a `connect` conflict ⇒ UNSAT
(`mismatched_fold_does_not_bind`, `forged_spend_leg_never_mints_a_leaf`).

**NEEDED.** Bind the ring's legs to the **deployed** nullifier accumulator inside the clearing AIR.
Today each leg's `pre`/`post` is a per-leg toy `ShieldedState`; the freshness is proved against that
local state, not against the one deployed sorted-Merkle accumulator that the rest of the system
advances. The fusion at the spend-leaf is real; the *accumulator threading* — the clearing apex
consuming and advancing the single canonical nullifier root — is the weld. **Difficulty M.** Depends
on the deployed accumulator (exists) + the observer-threading residual named in the nullifier-flip
memory (item-3: `ShadowNullifierAccumulator` into `WireState`). Also open there: in-STARK
non-membership bound to the committed limb (light-client attestation).

---

## 5. Shielded SetField-attestation

**Grade: NEEDED (design).** Neither Lean spec nor circuit exists for the shielded allocation.

The goal: settle the **per-trader allocation attested-but-hidden** — prove a valid allocation
happened (each trader received exactly its cleared amount of its wanted asset) **without revealing
the allocation**. Today the clearing proves the *aggregate* is fair and conserving; the individual
trader→allocation map is not itself committed-and-hidden as a first-class object.

**NEEDED.** A shielded allocation-commitment settlement: each trader's post-batch position as a
hidden commitment, with a proof it equals `receivedAmount`/`receivedAsset` from the cleared cycle
(the fair-clearing already proves those quantities — `clearing_respects_limits`,
`cycle_individuallyRational`). Plus resolving the **SetField cohort ambiguity** (named): which
cohort a SetField write attributes to, so an allocation cannot be silently reassigned. **Difficulty
L.** Depends on 3 (the hiding property must be stated before "attested-but-hidden allocation" is
meaningful) and 4 (allocations land as note-creates against the accumulator).

---

## 6. Composition + deployed-assurance

**PROVEN.** The AIRs are STARK-sound on the real floors (`HashCR` + `Poseidon2ChipArithSound`,
BCIKS20 proved for deployed code, FRI provably ~112.6-bit — memory
`project-linking-tower-forgery-closure`). The fusion is spec-proven end-to-end
(`shielded_ring_fused_clears`), and the in-AIR conservation refines the Lean group-Pedersen
conservation (`inAir_conservation_refines_pedersen`) — the deployed field gate forces what the Lean
proves for the value-mint hazard (no toy stand-in: the `refVC` additive toy and `refTreeRoot` linear
hash are *retired* by `RealCrypto.lean`).

**BUILT.** The 2-leg apex folds and verifies green (`honest_shielded_2ring_folds_and_verifies`), and
the cleared claim round-trips.

**NEEDED / named residuals (what is NOT yet clean):**
- The N-leg apex under the **deployed VK** (composition 1 + 6): the 2-leg apex is a leaf-wrap config,
  not the deployed epoch VK. **Difficulty M→L.**
- The full Ristretto EC excess (2) and 64-bit range (2) remain ATTESTED off-AIR — the coordinate
  `pedTwoGen` model is faithful for the mint hazard but is a resolution placeholder for the real
  curve.
- The blinding coordinate's group-scalar reduction rides the off-AIR Schnorr excess (out of the
  value-mint weld's scope, correctly — a blinding wrap mints no value).
- The uniform-price/optimality layer is MODEL-proved, not ledger-realized (DREGGFI-VISION §7,
  ZK-AUCTION-SUITE §8) — individual-rationality fairness IS ledger-realized; say which.

- **1 (N-leg AIR)** unlocks a real DEX batch (not 2 legs) → app wiring. Independent of the crux.
- **4 (accumulator bind)** makes the double-spend gate deployed-real, not per-leg toy. Independent, M.
- **2 (EC-in-circuit)** is the deepest single item (RESEARCH) but is a *faithfulness* upgrade — the
  mint hazard is already closed — so it is not on the critical path to a demonstrable private batch.
- **3 (the ZK theorem)** depends on 1+2 finalizing the transcript, but its *statement* can be drafted
  now against the current 2-leg transcript and refined. It is the differentiator and gates the honest
  "nobody learns what settled" claim.
- **5 (shielded allocation)** waits on 3+4.

---

## The single most-valuable next step

**Two, in priority order — and they are the ones the task frame calls out:**

1. **The clearing-proof ZK / reveal-nothing theorem (component 3).** This is the crux and the
   differentiator: it is the *only* thing that turns "private by construction, tested at the PCS
   layer" into "proved that the operator learns nothing about who/amounts/allocations." Concretely,
   the first move is to **write the honest statement** — instantiate `PerfectZK.view`/`sim` on the
   ring-clearing transcript `[nf, root, vb]ⁿ` + the proof, prove `view_indep_of_witness` reducing the
   exposed lanes to the named carriers (`nullifier_hides_identity`, value-binding hiding, public
   root), and **name the HidingFriPcs statistical-ZK floor** explicitly (graded, both-pole teeth),
   the way `HashCR` and DLog `binding` are named. Difficulty RESEARCH; highest strategic value.

2. **The N-leg ring-clearing AIR (component 1).** Difficulty M, no new crypto, and it unlocks a real
   DEX batch + the app wiring. It also finalizes the transcript shape that (1) must quantify over, so
   the two are complementary: build N-leg to fix the transcript, then state the ZK theorem over it.

Everything else (EC-in-circuit, 64-bit range, shielded allocation) is real work but either a
faithfulness upgrade off the critical path or a downstream dependent.

---

## Honest 4-line summary

1. **PROVEN:** the private-matching *clearing spec* is machine-checked and non-vacuous — a shielded
   ring clears conserving + fair + no-double-spend + **fused** to real hidden notes
   (`shielded_ring_clears`, `shielded_ring_fused_clears`), over real Pedersen (DLog binding) and real
   Poseidon2 (sponge CR), toys retired; the value-mint / wraparound hole is closed *in-circuit*.
2. **BUILT:** the 2-leg tight-cycle ring-clearing apex AIR runs and folds green with tested teeth
   (non-conserving, wraparound, double-spend, mis-fusion, mismatched-fold all UNSAT), proving through
   the hiding PCS with only `[nf, root, vb]` exposed and all plaintext witness-only.
3. **THE FRONTIER is the reveal-nothing property (component 3):** the clearing is private *by
   construction* but there is **no theorem yet that its transcript is independent of the trades** — no
   simulator/indistinguishability at the clearing level and no named statistical-ZK floor for the
   deployed hiding FRI. That theorem is the differentiator and does not exist today.
4. **Also NEEDED:** N-leg variable cycles + the partial-fill inequality in-AIR (M), binding legs to
   the *deployed* nullifier accumulator (M), full Ristretto EC excess in-circuit (RESEARCH,
   faithfulness), and the shielded attested-but-hidden allocation (L). Honest posture: the 2-leg AIR
   and the spec are real; the fully-private N-leg ZK clearing that reveals nothing is the frontier —
   do not overclaim it as proved.
