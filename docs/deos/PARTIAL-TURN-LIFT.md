# Partial-Turn Lift — the held promise as a first-class continuation

A turn is the exercise of an attenuable proof-carrying token over owned state, leaving a
verifiable receipt. A *partial* turn is that same exercise with a hole in it: a value it
will consume is not yet known, but the SHAPE of how it will be consumed — which field, whose
write, under which predicate — is fixed now. This document specifies the lift that makes a
held partial turn a first-class object the cockpit can stage, inspect, and resume.

## 1. What already exists (census, not invention)

The promise-pipelining substrate is built and proven; the lift WIRES it, it does not build it.

- **`turn::eventual`** (`turn/src/eventual.rs`) — `EventualRef { source_turn, output_slot,
  federation_id }`, `Target::{Concrete(CellId), Eventual(EventualRef)}`, `TurnOutput`,
  `Pipeline { turns, dependencies, atomic }`, `PipelineBuilder`. A turn whose `Target` is
  `Eventual` is a turn with a hole: it names *the slot a future turn's output fills*.
- **`Dregg2/Exec/ConditionalTurn.lean`** — `ConditionalBatch { nodes, edges }`, `Slots := Nat
  → Bool`, `execConditionalTurn` — Kahn-topological all-or-nothing execution; an open
  `EventualRef` edge IS a hole, its fill IS the producer node's commit-arm slot write. Proven:
  run order respects every edge (no use-before-define).
- **`Dregg2/Exec/GuardedHole.lean`** — the keystone. `GuardedHole { field, actor, target,
  guard }` (the EAGER SHAPE) + `fillGuarded h s n` (= `predStateStepGuarded`, the guarded
  `put`). The theorem with teeth: **`holeFill_binds_in_circuit`** — a successful fill binds
  BOTH its δ (post-state is exactly the `stateStep` write, no hidden mutation) AND its guard
  (every `Pred`-caveat discharged) into the committed post-state. The negative tooth,
  **`holeFill_rejects_guard_violation`** — a value violating the guard does NOT fill
  (fail-closed). Determination is EAGER, witness is LAZY.
- **`captp::pipeline`** — promise pipelining drained through the verified kernel executor;
  no-amplification + break-cascade over the executable drain.
- **`World` suspend gate** (`starbridge-v2/src/world.rs`) — `suspend()` / `resume(ResumeMode)`
  / `pending: VecDeque<Turn>`. A turn submitted while suspended STAGES into `pending` (the
  continuation) and commits on `resume(Drain)`.

## 2. The gap, named precisely

The cockpit's held continuation today is a **flat queue of fully-concrete turns**
(`VecDeque<Turn>`). Every staged turn already knows every value it will write. There is no way
to stage a turn that *awaits* a value — to hold a promise. The promise-pipelining structures
(`Pipeline`, `EventualRef`, `GuardedHole`) live in `turn::eventual` and in Lean, but the
suspend continuation cannot carry them.

The lift is therefore TWO surfaces:

1. **The held-promise continuation** — make the suspended continuation able to carry a
   `Pipeline`-with-holes (turns with unresolved `EventualRef`/`Target::Eventual`), not only a
   `VecDeque<Turn>`. Staging a turn with an open hole HOLDS A PROMISE; resume FILLS the hole
   (binding δ and guard, fail-closed) and only then drains.
2. **The effect-vocabulary surface** — an effect whose payload is a (partial) `ConditionalBatch`
   so a turn can WITNESS or EMIT a partial turn. (Design only here; see §6.)

## 3. The UX of a held promise

A held promise has a small, total lifecycle the cockpit renders directly:

```
        stage(turn with hole)            fill(value)                drain
  ┌──────┐ ─────────────────▶ ┌────────┐ ──────────────▶ ┌────────┐ ─────▶ commit
  │ EMPTY│                    │  HELD  │   (guard admits) │ READY  │
  └──────┘                    └────────┘                  └────────┘
                                   │ fill(value), guard REJECTS
                                   ▼
                              stays HELD  (fail-closed; the late witness
                                           cannot escape the eager shape)
```

- **EMPTY** — no continuation staged.
- **HELD** — a partial turn is staged with ≥1 unresolved hole. The cockpit shows the eager
  shape of each hole: which field it lands in, whose write, under which guard. The value is the
  only unknown. The world head is frozen (suspend gate); nothing commits.
- **READY** — every hole filled with a guard-admitted value. The continuation is now a concrete
  `Pipeline` (no `Eventual` targets remain) and may drain through the normal `commit_turn` gate.
- A fill whose value VIOLATES the hole's guard does NOT advance the state — the hole stays open,
  the continuation stays HELD. This is `holeFill_rejects_guard_violation`: fail-closed, never a
  silent admit.

The held promise is the UX shadow of `holeFill_binds_in_circuit`: you can stage a promise, but
you can only RESOLVE it on the terms the hole fixed up front.

## 4. Connections (the same object in three clothes)

- **A beacon value** (the resharing-chains workflow / forward-secure common-secret chains) is a
  promise resolved at the tick: a hole filled at quorum-after-t. The eager shape (which field
  the beacon lands in, under the threshold guard) is fixed when the chain is staged; the value
  arrives at the tick.
- **A time-lock** is a hole whose guard is a deadline predicate (`Conditional.resolve`): held
  until the clock admits, then filled.
- **A CapTP promise** (`captp::pipeline`) is a hole whose producer is a remote send; the
  `EventualRef.federation_id` names the remote federation whose receipt fills it.

All three are the same structure: a lazy witness over an eager shape, bound at fill.

## 5. Why STRONG holes stay inexpressible (the load-bearing line)

This lift carries ONLY the weak guarded hole — a `Pred` guard on a late VALUE. It deliberately
does NOT introduce a hole in a conservation or authority position (an undetermined δ, a lazy
SHAPE). A continuation that could stage a turn whose *contribution to conservation* is unknown
would let an undetermined-δ turn ride into the drain. dregg forbids this by inexpressibility:
there is no non-zero-δ primitive, joint turns take the whole agreeing cone, authority must be
in-circuit. The held-promise model enforces the same line: a hole carries a VALUE and a guard,
never an open δ-shape. Failure is by inexpressibility (safe), not by a silent admit.

## 6. The effect-vocabulary surface (design, deferred)

To let a turn WITNESS/EMIT a partial turn, the per-effect forest (`FullForestA`) the kernel and
the light-client apex fold over would need a node carrying a (partial) `ConditionalBatch`. The
open questions (honest, from the partial-turn memory):

1. A new `FullAction` variant carrying a `ConditionalBatch`, vs. a reflection of the existing
   `execConditionalTurn` into the forest. What does the executor do when an effect's payload is
   itself a batch of turns (nesting / fixpoint)?
2. Is the CIRCUIT in scope? The apex folds `FullForestA`; whether a batch-bearing effect can be
   given a descriptor + a refinement rung is the real feasibility question, not assumed.
3. How do slot-fills commit in the content-addressed record world (`RecChainedState` /
   `recTotal`)?

This surface is NOT built in this slice. The slice below builds surface (1): the headless
held-promise continuation, which is the part with a clean, bounded, fail-closed semantics.

## 7. The slice that ships

`starbridge-v2/src/held_promise.rs` — a gpui-free headless model of a held-promise
continuation. It mirrors the real shapes (`EventualRef`-style slot references, the eager
guarded-hole shape, fail-closed fill) without pulling in the executor, so it is testable in
isolation and both-polarity tested:

- `HeldPromise` — a continuation that may carry open holes; states EMPTY / HELD / READY.
- `Hole { field, actor, target, guard }` — the eager shape (mirrors `GuardedHole`).
- `Guard` — a minimal two-valued predicate over the fill value (mirrors a `PredCaveat`,
  enough to make the tooth bite TRUE and FALSE).
- `fill(slot, value)` — binds the value into the slot IFF the guard admits; fail-closed
  otherwise (the hole stays open, the state is untouched).
- `is_ready()` — true iff no holes remain open; only then may the continuation drain.

Both-polarity teeth: a guard-admitted value FILLS and advances toward READY; a guard-violating
value is REJECTED and the continuation stays HELD with the hole still open. A continuation with
an open hole is NOT ready (cannot drain) — the structural fail-closed.

## 8. Wiring (applied)

The module is registered in the shared crate root: `starbridge-v2/src/lib.rs` declares
`pub mod held_promise;` under `#[cfg(feature = "embedded-executor")]` (alongside `pub mod
world;`), with a comment citing this document. It carries no new dependencies (`std` only;
`serde` is already in the workspace if serialization is wanted later — the module does not
require it).

The cockpit cutover is the NAMED residual: `World::pending` is a flat `VecDeque<Turn>`
(`starbridge-v2/src/world.rs:185`), so the suspended continuation cannot yet carry a held
promise. The follow-on replaces the flat queue with a continuation that may carry a
`HeldPromise` — fill at resume, drain only when READY — a shared-`world.rs` edit sequenced by
the main loop.

## 9. The lift, wired onto a real `Pipeline` (`pipeline_continuation.rs`)

`starbridge-v2/src/pipeline_continuation.rs` — the §1/§7 model carried by a REAL
`dregg_turn::Pipeline`. Where `held_promise.rs` mirrors the shapes standalone (no executor),
this file IS the §2 surface-(1) lift: the suspend continuation able to hold a **Pipeline-with-
holes** instead of only a flat `VecDeque<Turn>`. gpui-free, both-polarity tested, gated on
`embedded-executor` (where `dregg-turn`/`dregg-cell` are linked).

- `HeldPipeline` — a continuation that stages real `dregg_turn::turn::Turn`s (the concrete body,
  with `dependencies` + the `atomic` flag carried verbatim) AND `PipelineHole`s (the promises).
  Same EMPTY / HELD / READY lifecycle; `is_ready()` is the structural fail-closed.
- `PipelineHole { eref, field, actor, target, guard, value }` — the eager `GuardedHole` over a
  REAL `dregg_turn::eventual::EventualRef`. The hole's identity IS the `(source_turn, output_slot)`
  the pipeline executor resolves; the partial turn it rides carries the matching
  `Target::Eventual(eref)` / `Effect::PipelinedSend { target: eref, .. }`. A hole IS a nullifier.
- `resolve(eref, value)` — binds IFF `guard.admits(value)`; fail-closed otherwise (hole stays
  OPEN, no state changes — `holeFill_rejects_guard_violation`). The bind sets only `value`
  (`None → Some`), never the shape (`holeFill_binds_in_circuit` — δ AND guard). Resolution IS a
  spend: a second resolve of a bound hole finds no OPEN hole (one-shot linearity, no overwrite).
- `resolve_at_tick(eref, tick_value)` — the §4 beacon connection: a beacon value is a promise
  resolved at the tick (a hole whose `AtLeast { threshold }` guard the quorum-after-t must reach).
- `drain() -> Result<Pipeline, DrainError>` — the READY→commit edge. Returns a runnable concrete
  `dregg_turn::Pipeline` (validatable, executable via `execute_pipeline` / `World::resume`) IFF
  READY; `StillHeld { open_holes }` while any hole is open (a held promise can NEVER drain);
  `Empty` when nothing is staged. `bound_values()` exposes the `EventualRef → i64` resolution
  table for a caller that rewrites the `Eventual` targets into concretes before drain.

Both-polarity teeth (the eleven tests): an all-concrete continuation drains to a real `Pipeline`
(`validate().is_ok()`); a staged partial turn HOLDS the promise and `drain()` is `StillHeld`; a
guard-admitted value resolves and drains; a guard-violating value is rejected, stays HELD, leaks
no δ into `bound_values()`; a double-resolve is a no-op (value not overwritten); a beacon below
threshold is fail-closed and above it resolves; a mixed concrete+partial atomic pipeline drains
only once the hole fills (deps + atomic flag preserved); the eager shape is never mutated.

### Wiring (applied)

- `starbridge-v2/src/lib.rs` declares `pub mod held_promise;` and `pub mod
  pipeline_continuation;`, both `#[cfg(feature = "embedded-executor")]` (alongside `pub mod
  world;` — `pipeline_continuation` needs `dregg-turn`/`dregg-cell`, which are gated on that
  feature).
- No new `Cargo.toml` dependencies: `dregg-turn`/`dregg-cell` are already pulled under
  `embedded-executor`; `pipeline_continuation` re-exports `Guard` from `held_promise`.

The cockpit/`World::pending` cutover (replacing `VecDeque<Turn>` with a `HeldPipeline`, filling at
resume / quorum-after-t, draining only when READY) is the remaining shared-`world.rs` edit — left
to the main loop. `HeldPipeline::drain()` is the exact seam it plugs into: the suspended world's
`resume(Drain)` hands the drained `Pipeline` to the executor instead of re-submitting a flat queue.
