# Token Mirror Bridge — mirroring a Solana/pump.fun SPL token into dregg's value layer

## What this is

A **mirror** brings an external token (`$DREGG`, an SPL token launched on
Solana via pump.fun) *into* dregg's value layer as a first-class conserved
asset. Once mirrored, the asset is an ordinary dregg `AssetId` and is `Payable`:
it pays for on-substrate services (the execution-lease / ToolGateway) over the
*existing* rails, with no new kernel verb.

This is the asset analogue of the chain bridges already in this crate
(`midnight`, `ethereum`, `mina`): those settle dregg *state proofs* onto other
chains; the mirror brings another chain's *value* into dregg.

## The two halves

### Mirror (Solana → dregg)

1. A holder locks `N` $DREGG into a lock vault on Solana (an SPL program /
   token account the bridge controls; the Solana-side program is *named, not
   built here* — see the honest-gap section).
2. The oracle / validator-set observes the lock and produces a **threshold
   attestation** over the canonical lock payload
   `(lock_id, spl_mint, amount, dregg_recipient, epoch)`.
3. dregg verifies the attestation against the oracle key for that epoch, checks
   the `lock_id` has not been seen (replay), checks `amount ∈ [min, max]`, and
   credits `currently_locked += amount` (`MirrorState::verify_lock` →
   `credit_lock`; the finer-grained `record_escrow` raises `currently_locked`
   ahead of `draw_mint` drawing against it).
4. The mirror mints `N` mirror-$DREGG to the recipient via
   `MirrorState::mint_against_lock`, which produces the existing
   `Effect::Mint { target, slot: 0, amount }`. `Mint` is `Generative`: the
   asset's *issuer well* is debited as the conserving dual, so the turn is
   per-asset `Σδ = 0` (`turn/src/action.rs` — `Effect::Mint`, `LinearityClass`).

### Redeem (dregg → Solana)

1. The holder burns `N` mirror-$DREGG via the existing
   `Effect::Burn { target, slot: 0, amount }` (`Annihilative`; the `was_burn`
   disclosure binds into the receipt).
2. dregg decrements `live_supply` and `currently_locked` and emits a
   `SolanaUnlockRequest { spl_mint, amount, solana_recipient, redeem_id }`.
3. The oracle / validator-set unlocks `N` $DREGG from the lock vault on Solana
   to the named recipient.

## Conservation invariant

The mirror enforces, after every operation:

```
live_supply ≤ currently_locked
```

— the mirror-$DREGG in circulation inside dregg never exceeds the $DREGG locked
on Solana. Each attested lock raises `currently_locked` by exactly its amount
and authorizes exactly that much mint; each redeem lowers both
`live_supply` and `currently_locked` by the burned amount. A mint that would
push `live_supply` past `currently_locked` is rejected
(`MirrorError::InsufficientLocked`) — so an unbacked mint is structurally
impossible, *given a truthful attestation*. The kernel's per-asset `Σδ = 0` is
a separate, independent guarantee on the `Mint`/`Burn`/`Transfer` effects
themselves (the executor's conservation checker, not the mirror).

## Trust model — be honest

**This first slice is a TRUSTED-ORACLE / validator-set bridge.** The dregg side
trusts that the threshold attestation over a lock is honest: i.e. that a quorum
of the oracle set will not sign a lock that did not happen, and will not refuse
to sign a real unlock. This is the *same* trust posture as the `midnight`
bridge's `FederationAttestation` (a Schnorr/Ed25519 threshold signature
aggregated to one epoch key), reused here directly. An optional **watchtower**
(permissionless fraud challenge, as in `midnight_gateway::Watchtower`) can turn
"trust the quorum" into "trust the quorum *unless* anyone proves fraud", but it
still rests on at least one honest watching party and an on-Solana fraud oracle.

**The trustless path (BUILT to `ConsensusVerified`):** a real trustless mirror
needs dregg to *verify the Solana lock itself*, not trust an attestation. This
is now the **Solana light client** route, and its cryptography + consensus
arithmetic are real (no longer a stub): `verify_lock_proof_consensus`
(`bridge/src/solana_trustless.rs`) reaches `LockProofTrust::ConsensusVerified` by
checking, against a tracked per-epoch `EpochStakeTable`, that ≥ 2/3 of active
stake validly voted the claimed `bank_hash` (real per-vote Ed25519 +
stake-weighted sum + duplicate collapse via `verify_supermajority`), that the
`bank_hash` recomputes from its committed components (`BankHashComponents::compute`,
binding the accounts hash + PoH tail), that the vault account's lock record is
included in that accounts hash (`verify_accounts_inclusion`, domain-separated
sorted Merkle), and — when present — that the PoH tick chain links the slot's
blockhash to a verified anchor (`verify_poh_segment` / `verify_poh_anchored`).
It routes through the SAME `credit_lock` conservation accounting as the trusted
path. Full design (Option A vs B, the migration): `docs/deos/TRUSTLESS-SOLANA-BRIDGE.md`.

The **zk proof of the lock** (a SNARK/STARK attesting "account X held ≥ N $DREGG
locked at slot S under program P") is the *other* route and remains distinct: the
**Ethereum** side of this repo already has the STARK→SNARK→EVM *settlement*
pattern (`bridge/src/ethereum.rs`, gap = the gnark Groth16 STARK-verifier
circuit), but the *inbound* zk-proof-of-lock for Solana is **not** reusable from
the ETH settlement path.

**The honest gap that remains** is narrowed to the **mainnet wire-format
adapter layer** (`solana_trustless.rs` calls it out explicitly): parsing real
vote `Transaction`s into `ValidatorVote`s, sourcing/rotating the
`EpochStakeTable` from Solana's stake program, the exact accounts-hash
fan-out/preimage, and a bounded/recursive PoH anchor policy. The `LockProofTrust`
dial tells the caller exactly which level a verification achieved, so the
structural check (`StructureOnly`) can never be mistaken for the consensus check.

## The payment path (end-to-end, real rails)

Once minted, mirror-$DREGG is an ordinary `AssetId`. Paying for a service is the
existing `Payable` desugar — the *same* `resolve_pay` route the SDK metered
ToolGateway charge uses (`sdk/src/tool_gateway.rs` →
`dregg_payable::resolve_pay`):

```rust
// bridged $DREGG (asset = mirror.asset) pays a lease/provider cell
let (action, _sig) = dregg_payable::resolve_pay(
    consumer_cell,     // holder of mirror-$DREGG
    mirror.asset,      // the mirrored AssetId
    lease_price,
    lease_provider,
    InvokeAuthority::Signature,
)?;
// → exactly one conserving Effect::Transfer { from, to, amount } (Σδ = 0)
```

No new verb, no `Effect::Invoke`, no new commitment field: the bridged asset
flows through the one verified value rail.

## What is real vs modeled (this slice)

- **Real:** the dregg-side mirror mechanism — attestation verification (Ed25519
  threshold sig + epoch key + replay dedup + amount bounds), the conservation
  invariant `live_supply ≤ currently_locked`, mirror-mint producing the real
  kernel `Effect::Mint`, redeem producing the real `Effect::Burn` + unlock
  request, and the proof that bridged $DREGG pays an execution-lease through
  `resolve_pay` (one conserving `Effect::Transfer`).
- **Trusted (this first slice):** the attestation itself (trusted-oracle). The
  trustless replacement is now built to `ConsensusVerified` (see above /
  `solana_trustless.rs` + `solana_consensus.rs`); this doc's *slice* is still the
  trusted-oracle path, with the light client as its now-real successor.
- **Real (trustless successor):** the Solana-consensus verification —
  stake-weighted Ed25519 vote check, bank-hash recompute/binding, sorted-Merkle
  accounts inclusion, PoH tick-chain linking — reaching
  `LockProofTrust::ConsensusVerified` (`bridge/src/solana_trustless.rs`,
  `bridge/src/solana_consensus.rs`; design `docs/deos/TRUSTLESS-SOLANA-BRIDGE.md`).
- **Not built (named gaps):** the Solana-side lock-vault SPL program; the
  mainnet **wire-format adapter layer** for the trustless path (real vote
  `Transaction` parsing, `EpochStakeTable` sourcing/rotation, exact
  accounts-hash preimage, PoH anchor policy); the inbound zk-proof-of-lock
  route; the executor wiring that grants the mirror cell `EFFECT_MINT` authority
  over its own issuer well in a live `World` (the effect is produced here;
  minting it requires the mirror cell to hold mint authority — see
  `turn/src/executor/apply.rs`, `holds_mint_authority`).
