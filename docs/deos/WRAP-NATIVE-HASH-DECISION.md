# The wrap must hash BN254-native, not emulate BabyBear (measured decision)

*2026-07-11. A panel of three cryptoarchitect research agents + a red-teaming
synthesis, prompted by ember's question "are we sure this is as efficient as
possible?" Verdict: **our current gnark wrap is on the expensive emulated path;
the fix is the production-standard BN254-native-hash outer layer. High confidence,
production-anchored, measured.** Corrects the efficiency assumption in
`ETH-NATIVE-WRAP.md`.*

## The problem (measured, not assumed)

dregg's proof is BabyBear (31-bit) + Poseidon2. The gnark wrap circuit (BN254)
verifies it — but BabyBear does not fit BN254 natively, so every BabyBear op is a
BN254 mul + range checks. **Measured in our own `chain/gnark` today:**

- emulated BabyBear Poseidon2-w16 = **16,837 R1CS/permutation**
- emulated BabyBear Poseidon2-w24 = **27,213 R1CS/permutation**

A FRI verifier is **hash-dominated**: ~19 queries × (~24-deep input Merkle path +
~7 FRI-round paths) × several tables + the NPO Poseidon2 tables ≈ **~1,000–3,000
permutations**. At ~16.8k each that is **~20–70M constraints for hashing alone** →
a GPU-class Groth16 prove (SRS 2²⁵+, tens of GB, minutes-to-tens-of-minutes) —
**no better than the SP1 RISC-V path we are replacing.** The SP1 slowness was the
*same emulation tax*; a naive gnark FRI verifier just relocates it from RISC-V
cycles to BabyBear-in-BN254 field emulation.

## The fix (what RISC0 and SP1 both actually do)

Insert **one BN254-native-hash outer "shrink" recursion layer** between the apex
and gnark — the analogue of **RISC0's `identity_p254`** and **SP1's `shrink`
stage**. It re-verifies the current `ir2_leaf_wrap` apex and **re-commits its FRI
Merkle tree with Poseidon2-over-the-BN254-scalar-field**, with Fiat–Shamir over a
`MultiField32Challenger` (pack BabyBear→BN254 on absorb, split BN254→BabyBear limbs
on squeeze). Trace/quotient arithmetic stays over BabyBear; **only the hash field
switches.** The gnark verifier then hashes **natively**.

- RISC0 docs, verbatim: *"In Groth16 over BN254, it is much more efficient to
  verify a STARK that was produced with Poseidon over the BN254 base field
  compared to using Poseidon over BabyBear."* Their production `stark_verify.circom`
  (native Poseidon254) = **5,676,573 R1CS** (SRS 2²³) — the real size of a
  native-hash STARK→SNARK wrap, i.e. ~5.7M, not tens of millions.
- SP1 does the identical thing (`crates/recursion/circuit/src/hash.rs` +
  `challenger.rs`: inner layers over SP1Field, the **outer/wrap layer switches to
  `outer_perm` = Poseidon2 over Bn254Fr** with a `MultiField32ChallengerVariable`).
- Counter-example (the expensive path we're on): Polygon plonky2→gnark keeps
  Goldilocks-Poseidon, ~75% of the circuit is emulated hashing.

## The number (measured, this is the whole point)

| | per Merkle compress | full wrap (hashing) | Groth16 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Emulated BabyBear** (current) | 16,837 R1CS (w16), 27,213 (w24) | ~20–70M R1CS | GPU, tens of GB, minutes+ |
| **Native BN254 Poseidon2** (fix) | **187 R1CS** (measured, gnark std) | ~1–6M R1CS | CPU/modest-GPU, seconds–~2min |

**Swing on the dominant term: 90–145×.** Destination anchored to RISC0's real
5.68M-constraint native wrap.

## We already have the primitives (this is instantiation, not new crypto)

dregg's pinned Plonky3 checkout (`82cfad7`) **already ships everything**:
`bn254/src/poseidon2.rs::Poseidon2Bn254<3>` (t=3, α=5, 8 full + 56 partial),
`challenger/src/multi_field_challenger.rs::MultiField32Challenger`, the merkle-tree
MMCS. The recursion verifier is **field-generic** (`recursion/src/backend/fri.rs`:
`Val<SC>: PrimeField64`, not BabyBear-hardcoded). The gap is only that
`DreggRecursionConfig` hard-codes BabyBear Poseidon2 and there is **no outer BN254
config** — and `ETH-NATIVE-WRAP.md` planned the gnark circuit around BabyBear
gadgets (the emulated path).

## What we keep vs. redo

- **KEEP:** the plonky3-recursion BabyBear IVC (folding / `expose_claim` / VK-pin),
  the Groth16 EVM verifier + `IDreggSettlement.sol` + `bridge/src/ethereum.rs`
  (unchanged), the FRI verify **structure** in `chain/gnark` (`VerifyFri`, the fold
  logic, grinding, the query walk — the *algorithm* is unchanged), and `babybear.go`
  (still needed for the outer AIR's quotient-eval arithmetic).
- **REDO:** `chain/gnark`'s **hash + challenger** gadgets — `poseidon2_w16.go` /
  `poseidon2_w24.go` for *Merkle hashing* and `challenger.go` switch from emulated
  BabyBear Poseidon2 to **native `Poseidon2Bn254`**; regenerate transcript fixtures
  against the MultiField sponge. The emulated w16/w24 gadgets survive ONLY for the
  small BabyBear quotient-eval arithmetic, not for hashing. So the challenger /
  grinding / FRI-query / VerifyFri **work is not wasted** — the structure carries;
  the hash primitive underneath swaps.

## Red-team (the one place it could underperform)

The outer shrink layer's *prover* cost: Poseidon2-over-BN254 is a big-field hash,
slower per node than BabyBear. Rebuttal: the shrink trace is **tiny** (re-verify
ONE apex, re-expose 25 lanes), bounded, paid once off-chain, and dwarfed by the
gnark Groth16 prove it saves — RISC0/SP1 eat exactly this and land at seconds. It
**holds, but must be measured**, and the single risk is if dregg's apex has an
unusually large opening/public-value surface making the shrink trace big.

## MEASURED (experiments 1 + 3, 2026-07-11) — the real number + two corrections

Three validation experiments ran (native gadget + perm count + residual). The
combined, grounded picture — and it moved the number:

**Corrections to the estimates above:**
- **`max_log_arity = 1`, not 3** (the "3" was the *inner* config; the wrap verifier
  overrides to 1 — `plonky3_recursion_impl.rs:341`, empirically confirmed). FRI folds
  by 2 → **~17–19 FRI rounds, not ~7**. This is why the perm count is higher.
- **Real Poseidon2-w16 perm count ≈ 10,000–13,000** (central ~11,000), NOT the
  ~1,000–3,000 first estimated — driven by arity-1's ~18 rounds + a ~3,636 constant
  (leaf-hash/injection/challenger). Empirically measured via an instrumented
  `verify_all_tables` at the exact ir2 knobs; model
  `perms(m)=19·[(m+5)(m+6)/2+5m+9]+3636`.
- **The verifier hashes ONLY width-16** (`all_perms == w16_perms`). The width-24
  table is constraint-checked, never *hashed* — so the 27,213 w24 figure does NOT
  enter the hashing cost; only the w16 187/16,837 does. (But the w24 table's **452
  columns** dominate the *arithmetic* residual below.)
- **Native BN254 Poseidon2 measured = 243 R1CS/perm (t=3)**, KAT-verified against the
  HorizenLabs/zkhash gold vector. (The panel's 187 was a t=2 variant.) Swing on the
  hashing term ≈ **16,837/243 ≈ 69×**.

**The two terms (measured):**
| term | emulated | native |
|---|---|---|
| **Hashing** (~11,000 w16 perms) | ~185M R1CS | **~2.0–2.7M** |
| **Arithmetic residual** (reduced opening: ~752 opened cols × 19 queries, ~96–221 R1CS/col — Exp 3) | ~3.2M (range 1.4–4.2M) | ~3.2M (UNTOUCHED by the hash swap) |
| **TOTAL** | **~188M** (infeasible) | **~5.2M** (feasible, ≈ RISC0's real 5.68M) |

So: **naive emulated ~188M (dead on arrival) → native-hash ~5.2M (feasible, CPU/
modest-GPU minutes, ≈ RISC0).** Native-hash is confirmed necessary and correct, but
it lands at ~5M, not ~1.2M — the residual and the (larger-than-thought) hashing term
both matter.

**The three-lever plan to reach the ~1–2M fast target:**
1. **Native-hash** (185M→~2M hashing) — the confirmed go, biggest single cut.
2. **Fewer queries via higher blowup** — 19→~12 queries (log_blowup 6→10 holds
   130-bit soundness) cuts ~37% off BOTH terms (~5.2M→~3.3M), nearly free (tiny
   shrink prover).
3. **Cut the arithmetic residual** — (a) **fewer opened columns** (the width-24 table
   alone is 452 cols ≈ ~1.9M of the residual — does the apex need it that wide?), and
   (b) **GKR-batch the reduced openings** (one sumcheck replaces ~14,300 per-column
   ExtMuls → the ~3.2M residual toward ~0.3M). Full stack → **~1.5–2M**.

**⚠ FLAG — the rotated-proof pipeline is BROKEN at HEAD on `mldsa-sign-route`:**
`generate_rotated_effect_vm_trace` panics (wide-commit carrier count 59≠56,
out-of-bounds at `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs:3650/3663`, debug+release),
so `k_fold_turn_chain_proves_and_verifies` and the `*_deployed_tooth` tests fail
before proving. Exp 1's apex perm count is therefore *extrapolated* (m_apex 16–19,
the dominant remaining uncertainty), not from a real apex proof. This regression
(likely from in-flight DEBT-A wide-commit carrier work) blocks end-to-end wrap
validation and should be fixed.

## ⚑ MEASURED (2026-07-12): native-hash VerifyFri assembled + the hashing bet CONFIRMED

`chain/gnark/fri_verify_native.go` — the native-hash twin of `VerifyFri` (MultiFieldChallenger
+ native BN254 Merkle, same fork-faithful order, fold on emulated BabyBear via the SHARED
`friFoldRowArity2` path). Compiled at the ir2 shape (R=18 arity-2 rounds, 19 queries,
QueryPowBits=16):

| term | emulated | native | swing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TOTAL** | 40,938,030 | **1,018,263** | **40.2×** |
| hashing + transcript | 40,717,530 | 797,763 | **51.0×** |
| fold-arith residual | 220,500 | 220,500 | 1× (byte-identical, code-guaranteed) |

The re-architecture's **central bet is confirmed**: the dominant hashing term collapses
**40.7M → 0.8M (51×)**, and the fold residual is provably untouched (both circuits call one
shared fold path). Emulated ~40.9M lands in the ~30-70M band; native ~1.0M in the ~1-6M band.

**Honest scope of this measurement:** the synthetic instance is SINGLE-MATRIX — it exercises
the FRI-core hashing + one fold chain, NOT the batch-STARK reduced-opening residual (the ~3.2M
term above from ~752 opened columns × 19 queries). So it validates the DOMINANT HASHING term
directly and strongly; the full ~5.2M native total awaits the reduced-opening assembly + the
Rust shrink layer (`DreggOuterConfig`). It verifies a synthetic native-hash FRI, not a real
dregg apex (that needs the shrink layer). Verification boundary: the gadget + canaries +
challenger 61.9× were re-confirmed independently; the 40M-compile total is the committed
measurement test's figure (reproducible).

## Validate before re-architecting (the disciplined path)

Do NOT rip out gadgets yet. Two cheap experiments settle dregg's real numbers:

1. **Count the real perms** (~½ day): instrument the Rust apex verifier (the FRI
   Merkle-path walks at `ir2_leaf_wrap_config`) with a Poseidon2-permutation counter
   → the true current-path total (is it ~800 or ~3,000 perms?).
2. **Minimal native-hash FRI verify in gnark** (~1–2 days): build N native-BN254-
   Poseidon2 Merkle openings at the real ir2 depth/query count, compile, count → the
   real end-to-end constraint number, confirming ~1–6M before committing.

Then: prototype the Rust shrink layer (`DreggOuterConfig` = `Poseidon2Bn254` MMCS +
`MultiField32Challenger`), a bit-exact Rust↔gnark transcript differential
(TWO-GATES-PROVABLY-AGREE), and plan the Groth16 SRS for the ~1–6M circuit
(Perpetual Powers of Tau 2²³ covers it) before regenerating the settlement verifier.
Resolve the gnark version gap: dregg is on gnark v0.11.0 (no native Poseidon2 std);
bump to v0.15+ (ships `std/permutation/poseidon2`, 187 R1CS measured) or hand-roll a
~187-constraint native BN254 Poseidon2.
