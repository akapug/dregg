# Is dregg's universal-memory (umem) construction post-quantum?

This is an honest, grounded analysis. It separates the umem **memory argument** (the
thing `Dregg2/Crypto/UniversalMemory.lean` proves sound) from the **surrounding
authorization machinery** it rides inside, and states the quantum exposure of each
cryptographic carrier by name, against the carrier floor the assurance case publishes.

The short answer: **the umem memory argument is hash-based and carries no
elliptic-curve / discrete-log assumption of its own — it is plausibly post-quantum
modulo hash output sizing. The non-PQ exposure lives entirely in the surrounding
signature (ed25519) and value-commitment (Pedersen / DLog) carriers, not in the
memory argument.** So yes, umem is the post-quantum-est part of dregg — but "the
whole umem *path* end-to-end" is not yet fully PQ, because the token that authorizes
a memory write is an ed25519 signature.

## What umem actually is (the object under analysis)

`Dregg2/Crypto/UniversalMemory.lean` proves that **one** Blum offline-memory multiset
argument over a unified, domain-tagged address space (`Domain × κ`, the five domains
registers/heap/caps/nullifiers/index — `UniversalMemory.lean:75-86`) soundly covers
every per-domain projection simultaneously. The three load-bearing pieces:

1. **The interior memory argument** — `universal_memory_sound`
   (`UniversalMemory.lean:197-213`) reduces consistency of every domain to ONE balance
   via `MemoryChecking.memcheck_sound`. This is a **multiset / LogUp** permutation
   argument; its soundness is *combinatorial inside the field* (the balance is an
   algebraic identity the STARK enforces), not a crypto assumption.

2. **The boundary roots** — the four map roots (cap/nullifier/heap/index) are derived
   sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle roots over the final memory cells: `boundaryCells`
   (`:320`), `boundary_root_derived` (`:416-422`), and the anti-forgery teeth
   `boundary_init_root_bound` (`:475-479`) and `nullifier_fresh_binds_root`
   (`:578-593`). These ride exactly ONE named crypto carrier:
   **`Poseidon2SpongeCR`** (`Poseidon2Binding.lean:158-169`), collision-resistance of
   the in-circuit Poseidon2 sponge. The header pins it explicitly: "Crypto enters
   ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis ... never as an axiom"
   (`UniversalMemory.lean:47-49`).

3. **The proof that wraps it** — the whole memory table + boundary roots are attested
   by the deployed batch-STARK. That soundness is the STARK floor
   (`docs/STARK-FLOOR.md`): `StarkSound` / FRI extraction over BabyBear with a
   Poseidon2 Merkle commitment. No pairing, no DLog.

So the umem argument's *entire native* cryptographic dependency is two things:
**Poseidon2 collision-resistance** and **FRI/STARK soundness** (which itself bottoms
out in Poseidon2 CR for its Merkle commitments). Both are hash-based.

## (1) PQ vs non-PQ — by carrier

The assurance case names eight floor items (`AssuranceCase.lean:21-41`). Mapping them
onto the umem path:

### PQ — the umem memory argument itself (hash-based, no DLog)

| Carrier | Where (file:line) | Role in umem | Quantum status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Poseidon2-permutation CR** | `AssuranceCase.lean:27-32`; `Poseidon2Binding.lean:158-169` | Sorted-Merkle boundary roots; `root_injective` anti-forgery teeth; nullifier absence binding | **PQ-plausible.** Generic hash, no algebraic structure broken by Shor. |
| **FRI / STARK soundness** | `AssuranceCase.lean:38-39`; `docs/STARK-FLOOR.md` | Attests the memory table + balance + boundary roots | **PQ-plausible.** FRI is hash-/IOP-based; its Merkle commitments are Poseidon2. No DLog. |
| **The Blum multiset balance** | `universal_memory_sound`, `memcheck_sound` (`UniversalMemory.lean:197`) | The interior soundness — registers/heap/caps/nullifiers/index from one check | **Not cryptographic.** A field-algebraic permutation identity; nothing for a quantum computer to attack beyond the field/hash terms already counted. |
| **BLAKE3 CR** | `AssuranceCase.lean:33` | Out-of-circuit transcript/content hash | **PQ-plausible.** Generic hash. (Adjacent, not strictly inside the in-circuit memory argument.) |

### NOT PQ — the surrounding authorization / value carriers

| Carrier | Where (file:line) | Role | Quantum status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ed25519 EUF-CMA** | `AssuranceCase.lean:34`, `:149-155`; `turn/src/action.rs:216,256,395-407,523`; `turn/src/composer.rs:22`; `turn/src/conditional.rs:481-484` | The signature that AUTHORIZES the turn whose effects produce the memory writes; `credentialValid` routes to the ed25519 carrier | **BROKEN by Shor.** ed25519 is a discrete-log scheme on Curve25519; a CRQC recovers the signing key from the public key. |
| **Pedersen / discrete-log** | `AssuranceCase.lean:37`, `:231-233`; `cell-crypto/src/value_commitment.rs`, `value_link_zk.rs`; `circuit/src/effect_action_air.rs` | Pedersen value commitments (only when values are committed rather than cleartext) | **Hiding BROKEN by Shor** (DLog falls); binding is computational-DLog too. The case proves committed = cleartext (`Spec.committed_iff_cleartext`, `:233`), so this is conditional, not always on the umem path. |
| **X25519 / curve25519 ECDH** | `captp/Cargo.toml:15-17`; `cell-crypto/Cargo.toml:16-21` | CapTP transport key agreement, stealth one-time keys (`action.rs:395-407`) | **BROKEN by Shor** (ECDH = DLog). Transport-layer, adjacent to umem, not in the memory soundness. |
| **HMAC / AEAD** | `AssuranceCase.lean:35-36` | Macaroon caveat tags; sealed payloads | **PQ-plausible** (symmetric — Grover only). Adjacent to authority, not the memory argument. |

The key structural fact: **no elliptic-curve or discrete-log assumption appears
*inside* the umem memory argument.** The DLog carriers (ed25519, Pedersen, X25519)
sit in the authorization and value-hiding layers that *feed* the memory writes, not in
the soundness of the writes themselves.

## (2) Grover / Shor exposure, honestly

**Shor** (breaks DLog/factoring — the catastrophic one):
- Hits **ed25519, Pedersen, X25519** completely. These are not weakened — they fall.
  A CRQC can forge any turn signature, open Pedersen commitments to any value, and
  break CapTP transport key agreement.
- Does **nothing** to the hash-based umem memory argument (Poseidon2 CR, FRI, the Blum
  balance). Shor has no purchase on a generic hash or a multiset identity.

**Grover** (quadratic speedup on generic search — the survivable one):
- Hits **Poseidon2, BLAKE3, FRI's Merkle commitments, HMAC, AEAD keys**. The classic
  rule: an `n`-bit collision/preimage target effectively drops toward `n/2`-ish under
  quantum search (with substantial caveats — Grover parallelizes poorly, and the
  collision speedup via BHT is closer to `n/3` and rarely worth it in practice).
- **The honest sizing question for umem.** The STARK floor (`docs/STARK-FLOOR.md:97-114`)
  states the soundness envelope as `130` bits conjectured / `73` bits proven, with the
  field challenge space `|EF| ≈ 2^124` and the Poseidon2 commitment hash as additional
  caps. Under Grover the relevant question is the **hash output / commitment width**,
  not the FRI query count: FRI soundness error is an interactive-protocol bound that
  Grover does not generically halve, but the **Poseidon2 Merkle commitment** and any
  fixed-output digest are subject to Grover preimage / BHT collision search. The
  faithful **8-felt (`≈124`-bit) commitment surface is already DEPLOYED** (the
  `node8` gadget, `CAP_DIGEST_W`/`HEAP_DIGEST_W = 8`, v9→v13 geometry — see
  `docs/FAITHFUL-COMMITMENT-LAW.md` / `docs/reference/faithful-commitment.md`), and
  it is exactly the quantity to size against a Grover adversary: a `124`-bit digest
  gives `~62`-bit quantum collision resistance under the (optimistic) BHT model. So
  the remaining PQ-Grover question is a **margin** one against that deployed 124-bit
  surface (widen further only if a larger quantum margin is demanded), not a
  faithful-commitment widening still-to-do — that campaign has landed.
- The grinding term (`query_proof_of_work_bits = 16`, `STARK-FLOOR.md:104`) is a hash
  preimage PoW; Grover halves its effective cost (`16 → ~8` bits). Negligible either
  way, but worth noting it is a Grover-soft term.

Net: **umem's PQ exposure is a sizing problem (Grover → double the hash/commitment
output), not a structural break.** The structural break (Shor) is entirely in the
non-umem carriers.

## (3) What would make the WHOLE umem path fully PQ

The memory argument is already on PQ-plausible primitives. To make the *end-to-end
path* — "an authorized turn produces a sound memory commitment a light client can
trust" — fully post-quantum, three changes:

1. **Replace ed25519 with a PQ signature.** This is the load-bearing one: today the
   token that authorizes a memory write is a DLog signature (`action.rs`,
   `AssuranceCase.lean:34,149-155`). Swap the `AuthPortal` / `CryptoKernel.verify`
   carrier to a NIST PQ scheme — ML-DSA (Dilithium) or SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, itself
   hash-based and thus the most conservative). The Lean side already routes this
   through a `Prop`-portal (item 3 of the floor), so the proof structure is unchanged;
   only the realized carrier and the wire format change. *(No PQ signature crate is
   currently wired into the workspace — the only "dilithium/sphincs/falcon" hits in
   the tree are a wordlist entry and transitive Cargo.lock substrings, not authority
   code.)*

2. **Remove / replace Pedersen value hiding.** If confidential values are wanted PQ,
   Pedersen (DLog) must go — to a hash-based or lattice commitment. The case already
   makes Pedersen conditional (committed = cleartext, `:233`); the cleartext path is
   already PQ, so the simplest fully-PQ posture is "no DLog value commitments."

3. **Size the hashes for Grover.** Keep Poseidon2/BLAKE3/FRI, but pin the commitment
   and digest widths so post-Grover margins meet the target. The commitment surface is
   already matched to the FRI `~130`-bit envelope: the faithful `8-felt` (`~124`-bit)
   commitment is DEPLOYED at HEAD (`docs/FAITHFUL-COMMITMENT-LAW.md` /
   `docs/reference/faithful-commitment.md`; the historical widening analysis is
   archived at `.docs-history-noclaude/FAITHFUL-STATE-COMMITMENT.md`), so this is a
   margin-tuning knob rather than open work. Prefer the proven
   (Johnson-bound `73`-bit) parameter envelope or raise queries if a quantum margin is
   demanded. X25519 transport → a PQ KEM (ML-KEM) closes the adjacent confidentiality
   leg.

Note FRI/STARK itself needs **no** redesign — it is already a transparent, hash-based
proof system. That is the whole reason this analysis comes out favorable.

## (4) Verdict — is umem "the post-quantum-est part of dregg"?

**Yes, with the boundaries named.**

- The umem **memory soundness argument is post-quantum-plausible today**: its only
  native crypto carriers are Poseidon2 collision-resistance and FRI/STARK soundness
  (`UniversalMemory.lean:47-49`, `AssuranceCase.lean:27-32,38-39`), both hash-based,
  with the interior covered by a non-cryptographic field-algebraic Blum balance
  (`universal_memory_sound`, `:197`). No elliptic-curve or discrete-log assumption
  lives inside it. Its only quantum exposure is **Grover sizing of the hash/commitment
  output** — a parameter choice, not a broken assumption.

- It is *more* post-quantum than the rest of dregg precisely because the rest of
  dregg's trust still leans on **Shor-breakable DLog carriers**: ed25519 turn
  signatures (`AssuranceCase.lean:34`), Pedersen value commitments (`:37,231-233`),
  and X25519 transport. Those are the parts that *fall* to a CRQC, not merely shrink.

- The honest caveat against overclaiming: **"umem is PQ" ≠ "the umem path is PQ."** A
  light client trusting a Q-chain trusts the STARK (PQ-plausible) *and* the ed25519
  signature that authorized the turn (NOT PQ). Until the signature carrier is swapped
  for a PQ scheme, an adversary with a quantum computer forges authority *before* the
  memory argument ever runs — the sound memory commitment then faithfully records a
  forged turn. The memory argument is honest; its input authority is not yet
  quantum-safe.

The carrier floor that grounds all of this: `AssuranceCase.lean:21-41` (the eight
items), `docs/STARK-FLOOR.md` (the FRI/Poseidon2 envelope), and
`Dregg2/Circuit/Poseidon2Binding.lean:158-169` (the sole in-circuit crypto carrier the
umem boundary roots ride). The one-line summary: dregg's *memory commitment* is built
on the post-quantum side of the cryptographic ledger; its *authority tokens* are not —
and closing that gap is one carrier swap (ed25519 → ML-DSA/SLH-DSA) plus a hash-width
sizing pass.
