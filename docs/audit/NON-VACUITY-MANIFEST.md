# Non-Vacuity Manifest — every load-bearing security-property theorem + its biting tooth

**Elevated-Assurance Pillar 4b** (`docs/deos/ELEVATED-ASSURANCE-PROGRAM.md` §4b). The poster's law:
*a green only counts if it reds when the thing it guards breaks.* This manifest is the total ledger
that makes that law a **gate** — one row per load-bearing security-property theorem (the ones that
claim a WORLD property, per `docs/audit/SECURITY-PROPERTY-MAP.md`), each pinned to:

- **fires** — a NAMED, `#assert_axioms`-clean non-vacuity companion: the theorem's hypotheses are
  jointly satisfiable AND its conclusion is exercised on a concrete instance (not vacuously true), and
- **bites** — a NAMED biting companion: a hostile forge/mutation that makes the guarded property
  FALSE, so the theorem is two-valued (not `:= True`).

The **meta-gate** that enforces this manifest — `circuit/tests/security_property_nonvacuity_gate.rs` —
is a static ledger (the `keystone_descriptor_deployment_gate.rs` idiom, because Lean theorems are not
reflectively enumerable from Rust). It REDS when a load-bearing theorem is `Missing` a tooth, when a
`SpotCheckedOnly` row lacks a `promote:` closure lane, or when a named companion is **absent from the
metatheory Lean source** (the ledger cannot go stale silently — deleting a Lean tooth reds the gate).
Its companion in-band check is Lean's `#keystone_audit_tagged` (`Dregg2/Verify/KeystoneLint.lean`),
which sweeps every `@[load_bearing_keystone]` and throws at elaboration if a tagged keystone loses its
`satisfiable`/`teeth`. This gate is the **totality** layer over that per-keystone discipline.

## Status classes

- **HAS-BITING-TOOTH** — a NAMED fires + a NAMED bites, both source-grounded. The gate passes.
- **SPOT-CHECKED-ONLY** — only `#guard`/`example` witnesses (they red at elaboration but are not
  registrable NAMED companions). Allowed ONLY with a `promote:` closure lane.
- **MISSING** — no non-vacuity companion. Always fails the gate. *(The finding — none remain.)*

## The finding (what 4b closed)

Before this lane, two load-bearing property apexes each had **one leg of the tooth as a `#guard`
only**, not a NAMED companion the meta-gate could register:

1. **`reachable_total_zero`** (Guarantee B) had a NAMED `reachable_total_zero_satisfiable` (fires) but
   its biting forge lived only as `#guard` witnesses in `ReachableConservation.lean` (the unauthorized
   mint / non-live-issuer refusals). **Added** `reachable_total_zero_teeth` + `nonzero_state_unreachable`
   (`Dregg2/Verify/KeystoneAuditConservation.lean`): a fabricated single-cell state carrying value with
   no matching issuer-well debit FAILS `ExactConservation` and is therefore **unreachable** — the value
   law provably discriminates and constrains the reachable state space. `#assert_axioms`-clean.

2. **`reshareN_attenuates`** (Guarantee A extension, over the kernel) had a NAMED
   `reshare_refuses_amplification` (bites) but its non-vacuity fired only as `#guard`s. **Added**
   `reshareN_attenuates_satisfiable` (`Dregg2/Deos/Membrane.lean`): a concrete two-hop reshare chain
   whose `⊆` conclusion is exercised AND whose attenuation is STRICT (a `grant` authority held upstream
   is darkened downstream) — the subset is proper, so the theorem is non-vacuous. `#assert_axioms`-clean.

Both are now registered rows above, and the meta-gate cross-checks that these exact names exist in the
Lean source, so deleting either tooth reds the build.

## How the meta-gate is itself non-vacuous

`meta_gate_bites` (`security_property_nonvacuity_gate.rs`) proves the gate REDS on: a `Missing` row, an
un-laned `SpotCheckedOnly` row, a `HasBitingTooth` naming a companion absent from the source (the
stale-ledger catch), and an empty companion name — and PASSES a fully-grounded row (so it is not
red-for-everything). The decisive case removes the real `reachable_total_zero_teeth` name from the
scanned source-set and asserts the gate reds on exactly that row. A coverage gate that passed vacuously
would be the exact sin it polices; this one is proven to bite.

## Adding a new security property

When a new WORLD-property apex lands: add its `*_satisfiable` (fires) + a biting `*_teeth`/`forged_*`
(bites) companion in Lean, then add a `HasBitingTooth` row here and in the gate's `security_property_manifest()`.
A new property added without a row does not appear in the ledger — pair this with review of new
`@[load_bearing_keystone]` / `#assert_axioms` blocks. If you genuinely cannot name the tooth yet, use a
`SpotCheckedOnly("… promote: <lane>")` row — a conscious, reviewed decision, never a silent gap.
