# Substrate-Soundness Repair Roadmap

From a driving-first audit (2026-07-12) + the offering/game lanes' findings. Each item was found because an offering
or game had to WORK AROUND it. Fix at the root; retire the workarounds. (STATUS updated as lanes land.)

## CONFIRMED (code-evidenced), ranked by load-bearing × cheap
1. **Bazaar pair — vacuous self-modifying gate + clamp-hidden underflow** (MUST fix together). The scene compiler's
   pre->post lift (`spween-dregg/src/compiler.rs:444-475`) collapses `{gold>=50} ~ gold-=50` to `FieldGte(slot,0)`
   (always true) when the spend meets the threshold; `world.rs:292` CLAMPS an underflowing Modify at 0 instead of
   refusing — so an ineligible spend commits. Fix: world.rs rejects on underflow; the compiler stops encoding a
   pre-state floor via a clamped post-state threshold. App-level, cheap. → IN FLIGHT (spween lane).
2. **Le/Lt over-strict clamp** (`compiler.rs:458-466`) — same threshold-clamp root, opposite direction (spurious
   false rejection of eligible plays). Fold into #1. → IN FLIGHT (spween lane).
3. **Passage entry-effect re-run** — `Driver::advance`/`flush` (`world.rs:591-623`) commit a destination passage's
   entry effects UNGATED under the choice's method; a cycle back re-seeds state. Fix: a compiler-emitted once/WriteOnce
   guard on entry-effect slots (the re-run is external `spween::Runtime` behavior). → IN FLIGHT (spween lane).
4. **Scene-compiler dispatch-default-deny — dead heap hatch.** `compile_scene` (`compiler.rs:175-224`) builds
   `CellProgram::Cases` with only per-choice `MethodIs` cases + NO `Always` catch-all, so `apply_raw` (the >16-slot
   heap-collection escape hatch, `world.rs:333`) matches no case -> refused (`NoTransitionCaseMatched`). apply_raw/
   read_heap have ZERO test coverage. Fix: compiler emits an `Always`-guarded catch-all (or a heap-method case). Cheap.
   → TODO (fold into the spween lane / a follow-up; pin with a 5-line apply_raw repro first).

## SUSPECTED (mechanism evidenced, needs a driven repro)
5. **AffineLe-quorum aliasing in collective-choice** (SECURITY). Quorum = `AffineLe{M·RESOLVED − ΣTALLY ≤ 0}` with
   TALLY slots carrying ONLY `Monotonic` (`collective-choice/src/lib.rs:520-540`) — no per-turn delta cap, no per-voter
   actor binding. If `vote.rs` doesn't bind writer->distinct voter + cap the increment to +1, ONE actor can inflate a
   TALLY slot to M and arm RESOLVED — a forged quorum (the exact weakness `CountGe` was minted to replace, see
   `cell/src/program/types.rs:688-694`). Affects /council + the liquidity vote. Fix: migrate to `CountGe`, or add
   per-turn delta caps + per-slot actor binding. → IN FLIGHT (quorum lane).

## KERNEL + CIRCUIT (coordinate with metatheory/circuit — do NOT ship Rust ahead of the Lean/AIR twin)
K1. **HeapAtom has no exact-delta twin + no cross-key relation** (`cell/src/program/types.rs:468-489`). `DeltaBounded`
    bounds |Δ| but doesn't PIN it; every HeapAtom is single-key (no heap `FieldLteOther`). So heap-keyed quantities
    can't carry exact conservation teeth — the Bazaar hoisted its purse into fixed slots to get FieldDelta. Fix: add
    `HeapAtom::DeltaEquals{d}` + a cross-key relational atom, each an append-only variant WITH its Lean twin
    (`metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/Program.lean`) + the circuit AIR. → HELD (schedule when the circuit swarm settles).

## VERIFIED-FIXED (do NOT re-open)
- dregg-doc `three_way` now consumes its base (`graph.rs:399-440`) — fixed this session.
- The dispatch-default-deny KERNEL guard is correct (`eval.rs:101-129` + the `is_method_dispatching` carve-out).
- `starbridge-apps/nameservice` + `escrow-market` carry an `Always` invariants case (no default-deny). NOTE: the
  BROKEN one is `starbridge-nameservice` (what dreggnet-names wraps), being fixed separately.
- collective-choice's PROGRAM is a pure `Always` invariants program (no default-deny) — the exposure is #5's TALLY
  binding, not the dispatch.
