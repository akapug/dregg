# Substrate-Soundness Repair Roadmap

From a driving-first audit (2026-07-12) + the offering/game lanes' findings. Each item was found because an offering
or game had to WORK AROUND it. Fix at the root; retire the workarounds. (STATUS updated as lanes land.)

## CONFIRMED (code-evidenced), ranked by load-bearing × cheap
1. **Bazaar pair — vacuous self-modifying gate + clamp-hidden underflow** (MUST fix together). The scene compiler's
   pre->post lift (`spween-dregg/src/compiler.rs:444-475`) collapses `{gold>=50} ~ gold-=50` to `FieldGte(slot,0)`
   (always true) when the spend meets the threshold; `world.rs:292` CLAMPS an underflowing Modify at 0 instead of
   refusing — so an ineligible spend commits. Fix: world.rs rejects on underflow; the compiler stops encoding a
   pre-state floor via a clamped post-state threshold. App-level, cheap. → FIXED (see STATUS).
2. **Le/Lt over-strict clamp** (`compiler.rs:458-466`) — same threshold-clamp root, opposite direction (spurious
   false rejection of eligible plays). Fold into #1. → FIXED (see STATUS).
3. **Passage entry-effect re-run** — `Driver::advance`/`flush` (`world.rs:591-623`) commit a destination passage's
   entry effects UNGATED under the choice's method; a cycle back re-seeds state. Fix: a compiler-emitted once/WriteOnce
   guard on entry-effect slots (the re-run is external `spween::Runtime` behavior). → FIXED (see STATUS + CORRECTION).
4. **Scene-compiler dispatch-default-deny — dead heap hatch.** `compile_scene` (`compiler.rs:175-224`) builds
   `CellProgram::Cases` with only per-choice `MethodIs` cases + NO `Always` catch-all, so `apply_raw` (the >16-slot
   heap-collection escape hatch, `world.rs:333`) matches no case -> refused (`NoTransitionCaseMatched`). apply_raw/
   read_heap have ZERO test coverage. Fix: compiler emits an `Always`-guarded catch-all (or a heap-method case). Cheap.
   → FIXED via a reserved HEAP_HATCH_METHOD case, NOT the catch-all proposed here (see the CORRECTION).

## SUSPECTED (mechanism evidenced, needs a driven repro)
5. **AffineLe-quorum aliasing in collective-choice** (SECURITY). Quorum = `AffineLe{M·RESOLVED − ΣTALLY ≤ 0}` with
   TALLY slots carrying ONLY `Monotonic` (`collective-choice/src/lib.rs:520-540`) — no per-turn delta cap, no per-voter
   actor binding. If `vote.rs` doesn't bind writer->distinct voter + cap the increment to +1, ONE actor can inflate a
   TALLY slot to M and arm RESOLVED — a forged quorum (the exact weakness `CountGe` was minted to replace, see
   `cell/src/program/types.rs:688-694`). Affects /council + the liquidity vote. Fix: migrate to `CountGe`, or add
   per-turn delta caps + per-slot actor binding. → FIXED (CountGe; see STATUS — including the wasm card twin).

## KERNEL + CIRCUIT (coordinate with metatheory/circuit — do NOT ship Rust ahead of the Lean/AIR twin)
K1. **HeapAtom has no exact-delta twin + no cross-key relation** (`cell/src/program/types.rs:468-489`). `DeltaBounded`
    bounds |Δ| but doesn't PIN it; every HeapAtom is single-key (no heap `FieldLteOther`). So heap-keyed quantities
    can't carry exact conservation teeth — the Bazaar hoisted its purse into fixed slots to get FieldDelta. Fix: add
    `HeapAtom::DeltaEquals{d}` + a cross-key relational atom, each an append-only variant WITH its Lean twin
    (`metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/Program.lean`) + the circuit AIR. → LANDED (see the K1 section at the bottom).

## VERIFIED-FIXED (do NOT re-open)
- dregg-doc `three_way` now consumes its base (`graph.rs:399-440`) — fixed this session.
- The dispatch-default-deny KERNEL guard is correct (`eval.rs:101-129` + the `is_method_dispatching` carve-out).
- `starbridge-apps/nameservice` + `escrow-market` carry an `Always` invariants case (no default-deny). NOTE: the
  BROKEN one is `starbridge-nameservice` (what dreggnet-names wraps), being fixed separately.
- collective-choice's PROGRAM is a pure `Always` invariants program (no default-deny) — the exposure is #5's TALLY
  binding, not the dispatch.

## STATUS (2026-07-12, after the repair swarm)
FIXED + committed:
- #1/#2/#3-compiler (Bazaar pair) — spween-dregg/compiler.rs: the clamp-defeated lift now emits a companion FieldDelta;
  the broke buyer is REFUSED. Driven 153/0 (dungeon-on-dregg 118 incl. dice-combat + the workarounds).
- #5 (quorum aliasing, SECURITY) — collective-choice: RESOLVED gated on CountGe (>=M distinct committed voters, actor-
  bound commitment); a single-actor tally-inflation forge is REFUSED. Driven 11/0; /council + the liquidity vote inherit.
- nameservice dispatch-default-deny — starbridge-nameservice name_cell_program -> a flat Predicate; the app's own 6
  integration tests pass again; teeth still bite.
PENDING an ember action:
- #3-runtime (BUG 2, passage re-entry re-run) — FIXED on disk in the EXTERNAL ~/dev/spween (effects_executed HashSet),
  but breadstuffs pins emberian/spween@afb5b1f, so it lands only by committing+pushing spween + bumping the rev in
  spween-dregg/Cargo.toml. The test retreat_into_seed_room_does_not_reseed is #[ignore]d until then.
CLOSED SINCE (the former trailing TODO list — every item landed):
- #4 (dead heap hatch) — CLOSED below (see the CORRECTION: the Always-catch-all shape was disproven; the landed fix is a
  reserved HEAP_HATCH_METHOD case).
- wasm poll_program quorum-aliasing twin — FIXED: the wasm card's own poll_program (wasm/src/bindings_card.rs:1725)
  gates RESOLVED on a CountGe over the actor-bound commitment slot (`:1766`, commitment binding `:1773`), explicitly
  mirroring the fixed CollectiveChoice::poll_program (`:1185-1197`); the AffineLe-over-Monotonic forge is refuted in the
  file's own tests (`:1813-1908`).
K1 (HeapAtom::DeltaEquals + a cross-key relational atom) — LANDED, Rust + Lean twin + AIR wire (see the K1 section below).

## CORRECTION (2026-07-12): #4 fix-shape was wrong; #3-runtime + BUG2 landed
- #3-runtime (BUG 2) — LANDED: spween pushed (emberian/spween 95980f7) + rev-bumped across all 6 consumers; the re-entry
  test passes. (Two spween::Value versions during a partial bump was the pitfall — bump all pinners together.)
- #4 (dead heap hatch) — FIXED, but the proposed `Always`-catch-all was DISPROVEN (Always isn't a dispatch guard, so it
  never dispatches a novel method; EffectKindIs would open a choice hole). Correct fix: a reserved HEAP_HATCH_METHOD
  MethodIs case with Immutable teeth on all register slots (the hatch dispatches but reaches ONLY the heap). Driven 118/0.
  Honest boundary: the hatch is method-specific, not arbitrary-method.

## K1 LANDED (Rust+Lean), follow-up A closed, follow-up B open
- HeapAtom::DeltaEquals + outer HeapFieldLteOther — Rust (cell/program) + Lean twin, proven + #assert_axioms-clean,
  driven (dregg-cell 702/0). Append-only. Retires the Bazaar's fixed-slot-purse workaround.
- FOLLOW-UP A (AIR) — CLOSED: the heap-plane caveat wire exists. Exact-delta rides the tag-8 FIELD_DELTA re-eval
  (`new == old + p0` IS the HeapAtom::DeltaEquals semantics — the tag-8 alignment is proven in the Lean twin,
  EffectVmEmitRotationCaveat.lean `heapAdmits_deltaEquals_iff`); the displaced BOUNDED twin has its own staged tag
  SLOT_CAVEAT_TAG_FIELD_DELTA_BOUNDED = 20 (circuit/src/effect_vm/pi.rs:529) and the cross-key relation its own
  SLOT_CAVEAT_TAG_HEAP_FIELD_LTE_OTHER = 21 (pi.rs:543). Heap atoms are no longer executor-replay-only — they reach the
  PI off-AIR re-evaluation (staged: VK bytes unchanged; un-upgraded verifiers reject the tags as unknown, epoch-lockstep).
- FOLLOW-UP B (Lean fidelity) — OPEN, named seam: an EXACT heap-absent-fail-closed Lean lemma for HeapFieldLteOther.
  The Lean `heapFieldLteOther` (metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/RelationalCaveat.lean:367) reuses `fieldLteOther` at heap names
  and reads an absent key as 0 (the file states this explicitly, `:355-357`); the Rust executor fails closed on an
  absent key — a strict tightening (sound: they coincide exactly when both keys are present) but not exactly modeled.
