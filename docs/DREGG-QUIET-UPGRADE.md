# DREGG QUIET UPGRADE — building the new world atop the old

*Spec and governing rules for the content-script layer that scans any page for dregg-things in
plaintext and quietly upgrades them into live, verified, hyperinteractive `<dregg-*>` components.
Companion to `DREGG-WEB-SPEC.md` (the element/capability substrate). The layer is built:
`extension/src/detect.ts` (the detector, §2), `extension/src/port.ts` + `extension/src/netlayer.ts`
(the port + resolver, §3), `extension/src/elements/dregg-poll.ts` (the thin view). §§1–7 are the
governing rules the code cites; §9 states build status.*

## 0. The thesis

The old web can only carry **references**. That is all it needs to carry, because **dregg content
self-certifies**: `dregg://` objects are blake3-content-addressed and proof-verified. Therefore:

> **Twitter is an untrusted transport.** It carries a plaintext `dregg://poll/…`. It cannot forge
> the object (content hash) and cannot fake the tally (proof). The extension + the proof supply the
> physics. No platform cooperation is required, ever.

So we do not ask platforms to adopt dregg. We let people **paste a reference into the old web**, and
whoever holds the agent sees the new one. It degrades to a plaintext link; it upgrades to verifiable
hyperinteractivity. **This is not a growth hack — it is the content-addressing pillar realized in
the wild.** And it is not Twitter-specific: a detector upgrades *any* page — Mastodon, Discord, HN,
a blog, a wiki, a forum, an email client. **The extension is a universal upgrader of the existing web.**

---

## 1. The payload — one string, two readings

A dregg-thing must survive: plaintext, 280 chars, copy/paste, and link-shorteners (t.co) that rewrite
`href` but preserve the visible text.

**Canonical form:** `dregg://<kind>/<content-addr>[?q]` — e.g. `dregg://poll/b3_7f2a…`
**Mirror form (REQUIRED for graceful degradation):** `https://dregg.net/d/<kind>/<content-addr>[?q]`

The mirror form is a *clickable link* for anyone without the extension (its target is the
server-rendered, still-verifiable tier-`server` view — a named seam, not yet built; §9 item 4),
**and** it is detectable by the scanner as the same dregg-thing. One string, two readings: **inert-but-useful without the agent,
live-and-verified with it.** Posters SHOULD paste the mirror form; the scanner accepts both.

Constraints:
- The content-addr is the object's blake3 digest → **the reference is self-authenticating**; a
  platform that rewrites the URL breaks the link (fail-closed), it cannot substitute content.
- Query params are *hints only* (a display label). Never trusted, never rendered before verification.
- Length: keep the canonical under ~64 chars so it fits alongside prose in a post.

## 2. The detector (content script)

A single platform-agnostic content script:
- `MutationObserver` over the document; scans **text nodes** and **anchor `href`s** for the
  dregg-thing pattern (canonical or mirror). Handles t.co by preferring the anchor's *visible text*
  when the `href` is a shortener.
- **Idempotent**: mark upgraded nodes (`data-dregg-upgraded`), never double-upgrade; survive SPA
  re-renders (Twitter re-mounts aggressively) by re-scanning on mutation, keyed by the content-addr.
- **Respectful**: replace only the matched node/anchor; preserve surrounding prose and layout; keep
  the original link text as **light-DOM fallback content** inside the element, so if the component
  fails to boot the reader still sees a working link.
- **Opt-in per origin** (see §6): the user allows quiet-upgrade per site; default-deny on unknown
  origins is the safe posture.
- Platform adapters are DOM-quirk shims only (t.co unwrap, virtualized-list re-scan). **No
  platform-specific trust logic, ever.**

## 3. THE SPLIT — thin view in the page, engine in the extension

**The load-bearing architectural consequence.** A hostile host's CSP will block wasm in the page
context, and a hostile page must not be able to touch the prover. So:

```
  ┌── PAGE (hostile: Twitter) ──────────────────┐      ┌── EXTENSION (the person's agent) ─────┐
  │  <dregg-poll>                               │      │                                        │
  │    · Shadow DOM render surface (closed)     │◄────►│  netlayer  : fetch dregg:// (content-  │
  │    · light-DOM fallback = the original link │ port │              addressed, cross-origin,  │
  │    · NO wasm, NO keys, NO trust             │      │              cached, verified)         │
  │    · reflects trust="extension" + badge     │      │  executor  : the wasm world (in-tab    │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘      │              turn, receipt)            │
                                                        │  verifier  : light-client re-check     │
   the page can neither forge what's in the shadow      │  custody   : cipherclerk + confirm-    │
   nor reach the engine that produced it                │              intent consent (ext. UI)  │
                                                        └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is **more** trustworthy than an in-page engine, not less:
- **Shadow DOM (`mode: "closed"` on hostile hosts)** — page script cannot read or rewrite the
  rendered view. The page can *host* a `<dregg-poll>`; it cannot *lie about what's inside it.*
- **The prover/executor runs in extension context** — a hostile page cannot tamper with it, cannot
  see the witness, cannot swap the wasm.
- **The consent step happens in extension chrome.** `confirm-intent` shows the *faithful reading* of
  the turn bound to `[turn <hash>]` in UI the page **cannot overlay, forge, or clickjack.** So even
  a fully hostile page cannot trick a person into signing a different turn than they see. **This is
  the single most important security property of the whole design.**

### Port protocol (element ↔ background)
Minimal, capability-shaped, all responses carry a trust tier:
- `resolve(uri) → { object, receipt_chain, verified: bool, tier }` — content-addressed fetch + verify
- `render(uri, state) → html` — the world's `render_html()` (in-wasm, extension side)
- `fire(uri, turn, arg) → { receipt, new_state, verified }` — a real cap-gated verified turn
- `sign(turn_bytes) → signature | refused` — routes to `confirm-intent` consent UI (extension chrome)
- `verify(uri) → { ok, tier, receipt_count }` — the self-verify badge's source of truth

The element **never trusts the page for state**; every repaint re-reads through the port. The page
cannot inject affordances (the click wire is scoped to the shadow root).

## 4. The upgrade lifecycle

1. Detector matches a dregg-thing → creates `<dregg-poll>` (or the kind's element), moves the
   original link into its light DOM as fallback, sets `src`.
2. `connectedCallback` → open a port to the background → `resolve(src)`.
3. On `verified: true` → attach **closed** shadow root, `innerHTML = render(…)`, wire clicks *inside
   the shadow*, reflect `trust="extension"` + `[verified]`, render the honest badge.
4. On `verified: false` or resolve failure → **do not render the object**. Keep the fallback link,
   set `[error]`, show "⚠ could not verify — showing the original link." **Fail-closed, visibly.**
5. Click a choice → `fire(...)` → if the turn needs custody, `sign(...)` → the extension's
   confirm-intent shows the faithful reading → person approves → receipt → repaint + re-verify.

## 5. Trust labeling (never hide the tier)

Reflected attribute + visible badge, always:
- `trust="extension"` → "✓ verified by your cipherclerk"
- `trust="sdk"` → "✓ verified in this page" (page-bundled wasm; page code, still content-verified)
- `trust="server"` → "✓ verified by dregg.net (trust the origin)" — the mirror-form fallback
- absent/`[error]` → "⚠ unverified — original link shown"

A person must always be able to tell *who checked this*. The semantic web's failure was that an
asserted claim looked identical to a true one.

## 6. Security posture (the invariants)

- **Transport is untrusted** (content-addressed + proof) → fetch from anywhere; verify always.
- **Page is untrusted** → closed shadow DOM; engine in extension; click wire shadow-scoped; state
  never read from the page.
- **Consent is un-overlayable** → signing happens in extension chrome (confirm-intent), never in-page.
- **Fail-closed and visible** → an unverifiable object renders nothing but the original link + a
  warning. Never render unverified content as if verified.
- **Per-origin opt-in** for quiet-upgrade; default-deny unknown origins. The person decides which
  hostile hosts get upgraded.
- **No platform-specific trust logic.** Adapters may only fix DOM quirks.
- **Privacy**: resolving a dregg-thing reveals interest in that object to the netlayer. The extension
  netlayer SHOULD cache and MAY batch/pad; a per-origin gateway sees the origin's traffic. Document
  this honestly; do not pretend it is private.

## 7. Degradation ladder

| person has | what they see | tier |
|---|---|---|
| extension | live `<dregg-poll>`, can vote (custody), self-verified in-shadow | `extension` |
| page bundles `@dregg/sdk` | live element, verify locally; vote needs passkey/extension | `sdk` |
| nothing | a clickable `https://dregg.net/d/…` mirror link → server-rendered verifiable view | `server` |
| link broken/mangled | plaintext text; nothing pretends to be verified | — |

## 8. Why the poll is the first artifact — and what stands beside it

The `ViewNode` render vocabulary's core competence — buttons + integer args + numeric binds — *is*
a poll, so `<dregg-poll>` is the smallest complete artifact of the split and ships first. The
catalog does not stop there: `<dregg-doc>` (`extension/src/elements/dregg-doc.ts`) renders a
verifiable document, holds a first-class conflict as BOTH alternatives side by side, and publishes
a resolution as a real verified turn through the background DocEngine; `<dregg-story>`,
`<dregg-descent>`, `<dregg-sprite>`, and the composition pair `<dregg-embed>`/`<dregg-transclude>`
register from the same content script (`extension/src/content.ts`). Note the delivery split: the
plaintext *detector* pattern covers `poll` only (`detect.ts`); the other elements upgrade
author-placed tags, not scanned prose.

## 9. Build status

1. **BUILT — `<dregg-poll>` the thin-view element** (`extension/src/elements/dregg-poll.ts`):
   closed shadow root held in a module-private `WeakMap` (never on the instance), light-DOM
   fallback, shadow-scoped click wire, honest trust badge, fail-closed render — over the committed
   `PollWorld` (`wasm/src/bindings_card.rs:1238`, the real `collective-choice` engine's shape as
   an in-tab world; a second click is a genuine double-vote its nullifier refuses).
2. **BUILT — the background port + resolver** (`extension/src/port.ts`:
   `resolve`/`render`/`fire`/`verify`, every response tiered, custody routed through
   `confirm-intent`; `extension/src/netlayer.ts`: the real resolver — `blake3(content) == addr`
   gate, serve-receipt membership, receipt-stream root recompute, committee-anchored quorum, each
   fail-closed). The background wires `netlayerResolveObject` when a node URL is configured;
   `defaultResolveObject` (an FNV addr→shape derivation in `port.ts`) is the fixture/test
   stand-in only.
3. **BUILT — the detector** (`extension/src/detect.ts`): MutationObserver, canonical+mirror
   patterns, idempotent (`data-dregg-upgraded`, keyed by content-addr), per-origin default-deny
   (`dregg_upgrade_origins`), shortener adapter as the only platform-specific shim.
4. **NAMED SEAM — the mirror-form server view** (`dregg.net/d/…`, tier `server`) is not built:
   the mirror string parses and upgrades under the extension, but the no-extension click path has
   no server renderer, and no public devnet currently serves one.
5. **BUILT — packaging**: MV3 manifests for Chromium (`extension/manifest.json`) and Firefox
   (`extension/manifest-firefox.json`).

*Open: whether closed-shadow blocks our own devtools panel (likely: expose a privileged inspection
channel through the background, not the page); rate/padding policy for netlayer privacy. The
canonical URI grammar is pinned in `port.ts` (`dregg://<kind>/<addr>`, addr = `b3_<hex>`); the
detector's kind registry covers `poll`.*
