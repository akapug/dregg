//! # dregg Solana lock program (native, no Anchor)
//!
//! The Solana SIDE of the dregg token mirror (`docs/deos/TOKEN-MIRROR-BRIDGE.md`,
//! the "named, not built" gap). A `$DREGG` holder calls [`instruction::LockInstruction::Lock`]
//! to escrow their SPL `$DREGG` into a program-owned vault; the program writes a
//! 72-byte lock record the dregg relayer decodes and mirrors into the shielded
//! value layer.
//!
//! ## Why the layout is load-bearing
//!
//! The dregg relayer reads a lock-record account and (a) REQUIRES its Solana-owner
//! == the configured `lock_program` (this program), (b) decodes exactly 72 bytes
//! `lock_id(32) ‖ recipient(32) ‖ amount_le(8)` via `decode_lock_record`
//! (`bridge/src/solana_wire.rs:614-644`), (c) binds mint/amount/vault
//! (`bridge/src/solana_relayer.rs:671-738`, `observe_lock_at` /
//! `verify_finalized_account`; `scan_program_locks` iterates all accounts THIS
//! program owns). So the program MUST own every lock-record account and write those
//! exact 72 bytes — see [`record`].
//!
//! ## lock_id derivation
//!
//! `lock_id` (the mirror's replay nonce; `bridge/src/solana_mirror.rs:94-98`) is the
//! **32-byte pubkey of the per-lock record PDA** itself. That PDA is derived from
//! `[b"lock", config, nonce_le]` where `nonce` is a monotonic counter in the config
//! account, so every lock gets a globally-unique, deterministic `lock_id` with no
//! extra account. (The mirror computes `nullifier = H(spl_mint, lock_id)`; a unique
//! `lock_id` ⇒ a unique consume-once nullifier.)
//!
//! ## Unlock trust boundary — threshold attestation (residual CLOSED)
//!
//! [`instruction::LockInstruction::Unlock`] is the redeem path. It does NOT trust a
//! single configured key: it VERIFIES, on-chain, an **M-of-N ed25519 threshold
//! attestation** over the canonical [`attestation::unlock_message_hash`] of the
//! `SolanaUnlockRequest { spl_mint = config.mint, amount, solana_recipient =
//! recipient token account, redeem_id }` (the dual of `SolanaLockAttestation`,
//! `bridge/src/solana_mirror.rs`). The signatures ride in ed25519 native-program
//! (precompile) instructions in the same transaction; the processor reads the
//! instructions sysvar, resolves exactly the (pubkey, message) pairs the runtime
//! precompile verified, and requires `>= M` from DISTINCT configured oracle keys
//! over the reconstructed hash — plus the unchanged redeem-receipt-PDA anti-replay.
//! Fail-closed on: too few sigs, a duplicate signer, a non-configured signer, a
//! wrong payload, replay, and (NOMAD-LAW) an empty signature set or `M = 0`.
