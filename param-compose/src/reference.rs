//! **THE REFERENCE ORACLE** — the host-side composition, the canonical field streams, and
//! the roots. It computes the outcome OFF-circuit; `crate::air` RE-CHECKS it in-circuit
//! (translation validation, automatafl's posture).
//!
//! This module is where §9.3's "define now" list is actually decided:
//!
//!   * **canonical subject ordering** — ascending `identity` ([`canonical_subjects`]);
//!   * **duplicate rejection** — equal identities are refused, in-circuit by a STRICT
//!     increase (`crate::air`), so there is no separate host tooth to trust;
//!   * **missing/hidden/default values** — a param slot at or past `param_count` is
//!     canonically ZERO and is bound as zero into `subjects_root`; absence is COMMITTED,
//!     never ambiguous. A ruleset term addressing such a slot is REFUSED;
//!   * **schema/projection compatibility** — `param_count` is a PI and is absorbed into
//!     `subjects_root`, so a projection built under a different width yields a different
//!     root and cannot be silently reinterpreted;
//!   * **role tags** — opaque `u64`s, unique among active subjects, `0` reserved for
//!     absent. A term whose role is absent is UNRESOLVED and the composition is
//!     unprovable (fail-closed);
//!   * **explanation-term commitments** — [`Composed::contributions`] is the per-term
//!     vector `explanation_root` binds, so a "Why?" cannot diverge from the proven terms;
//!   * **finalized-root/witness semantics** — the AIR proves a composition over the
//!     projections it is GIVEN. It does not witness their finality; the projections'
//!     provenance rides `subjects_root` and is the caller's obligation (see
//!     `crate::model::Subject::identity` and the crate doc's honest-scope section).
//!
//! # The privacy boundary
//!
//! Param VALUES are private witness — they never appear in a public input. What is public
//! is: the counts, the four roots, and (by opening a root) whatever the caller chooses to
//! disclose. So the default posture is "nothing about a subject's params is revealed, and
//! the outcome is a commitment". Selective disclosure = the caller opens `subjects_root`
//! or `explanation_root` for the terms it wishes to reveal, against the same committed
//! vectors the AIR proved over — no second encoding, no second identity.
