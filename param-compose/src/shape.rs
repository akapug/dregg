//! **THE SHAPE** — the build-time bounds that define a VK class, and nothing else.
//!
//! The whole point of this crate is what is NOT in here. A [`ComposeShape`] carries
//! *maxima* (fuel/DoS bounds), never content:
//!
//!   * no role list — a role is an opaque field element the ruleset addresses by value;
//!   * no rule table — the coefficients are WITNESSED and bound to a public `ruleset_root`;
//!   * no param names or count — `max_params` is a bound; the ACTIVE `param_count` is
//!     runtime data bound into `subjects_root`;
//!   * no subject count — `max_subjects` is a bound; the ACTIVE `subject_count` is a PI.
//!
//! So a new game / creature system / institution is a **new ruleset root + new content
//! under an existing VK**, as long as it fits the shape's bounds. Only crossing a BOUND
//! (more subjects, more params, more knots) mints a new VK — the same way a bigger board
//! mints a new size class, not a new kernel.

/// **THE BINDING WIDTH.** Number of BabyBear felts in a committed root (`ruleset_root`,
/// `subjects_root`, `outcome_commitment`, `explanation_root`).
///
/// Each felt carries ~31 bits, so `W = 8` gives a ~248-bit digest — a ~124-bit collision
/// floor, matching the deployed 8-felt `WideHash` / `CellState::compute_commitment_8` and
/// sitting above the ~112.6-bit FRI soundness floor. **This is the only deployable
/// setting.**
///
/// # Why a width parameter exists at all (the measured substrate boundary)
///
/// The one-site 8-felt primitive — [`ConstraintExpr::MerkleHash8`], the native
/// `cap_node8` arity-16 compression — is **REFUSED by the custom-leaf lowering**
/// (`circuit/src/custom_leaf_lowering.rs:625`): it is an 8-OUTPUT Poseidon2 site and the
/// IR-v2 chip adapter carries single-output (`out0`) sites only. A custom leaf that must
/// FOLD (i.e. reach the door) therefore has only the 4-ary single-output forms
/// (`Hash4to1`, `Hash2to1`, `Hash3Cap`) available, each yielding a ~31-bit lane-0 digest.
///
/// So this AIR reaches ~124 bits the only way the substrate allows: `W` parallel
/// domain-separated 4-ary absorb chains (see `crate::digest`). That costs `W`x the hash
/// sites. `W = 1` is **INSECURE and measurement-only** (a 31-bit root is a 2^31
/// second-preimage / 2^15.5 collision — an adversary grinds a second rule table with the
/// same root and the "committed" ruleset stops being load-bearing). It exists so the
/// per-lane cost of the missing primitive is a NUMBER rather than an argument.
///
/// The named follow-up that retires the multiplier: teach the IR-v2 chip adapter to carry
/// multi-output chip sites, at which point `MerkleHash8` gives `W = 8` for ONE site.
