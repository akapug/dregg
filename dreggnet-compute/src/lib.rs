//! # DreggNet offering #compute — a COMPUTE EXCHANGE (a market for compute).
//!
//! The dungeon (offering #0) proved the [`Offering`] abstraction over a *game*; the market
//! ([`dreggnet_market`]) over an *auction*; a grain over *compute execution*; polis over
//! *governance*. This crate — the **8th offering** — proves it reaches a **metered compute
//! market**: someone posts a unit of work with an escrowed budget, a worker claims it, runs it,
//! submits a result, and the escrow settles conserved to the worker. It wraps the REAL
//! compute-exchange substrate ([`starbridge_compute_exchange`]) as a [`ComputeOffering`]:
//!
//!   * **POST** ([`advance`](Offering::advance) with [`TURN_POST`]) — a requester lists a job with
//!     a **budget**. A real verified `post` turn ([`build_post_action`]) escrows the budget on the
//!     job cell — `BUDGET` is `WriteOnce` (frozen), `STATE → POSTED`, a genuine [`TurnReceipt`].
//!     The job cell carries the compute-job policy FOR LIFE ([`job_program`]).
//!   * **CLAIM** ([`TURN_CLAIM`]) — a **worker** claims the job at a price `≤ budget`. This is the
//!     substrate's **cap-gated** `bid` ([`fire_bid`] at [`PROVIDER_RIGHTS`]): a real verified turn
//!     binds `PROVIDER_HASH`, writes `BID := price`, advances `STATE POSTED → BID`. The teeth are
//!     the substrate's: a **double-claim** on an already-claimed job is a **real refusal** (the
//!     `POSTED` precondition fails — nothing submitted, anti-ghost); an **over-budget claim** is a
//!     **real executor refusal** (`FieldLteField(BID <= BUDGET)`); a claim with an insufficient cap
//!     is a **real cap refusal**.
//!   * **SETTLE** ([`TURN_SETTLE`]) — the requester releases the escrow once the worker's **result**
//!     is submitted (the result rides the settle affordance's [`Action::text`], the SUBMIT step
//!     folded into settle — the substrate has no separate result method). The substrate's `settle`
//!     ([`fire_settle`] at [`REQUESTER_RIGHTS`]) reads the live `BID` + `BUDGET` and pays the worker
//!     **in full** — `PAID := claim`, `REFUNDED := budget − claim` — the FLASHWELL
//!     `AffineEq(PAID + REFUNDED == BUDGET)` conserving the escrow (**Σδ = 0**, the budget moves to
//!     the worker). A **settle without a valid claim** (no worker), a **settle without a submitted
//!     result**, or a **below-floor job** does **NOT** settle; a settle fired by a non-requester is
//!     a real **cap** refusal.
//!
//! [`verify`](Offering::verify) re-checks the committed chain against on-ledger truth: the escrow
//! conserves (`PAID + REFUNDED == BUDGET`, Σδ = 0), the paid amount is the worker's claim (the
//! budget really moved to the worker), and the on-ledger `PROVIDER_HASH` is the **real claimant**
//! (the winner is who actually claimed). [`render`](Offering::render) / [`actions`](Offering::actions)
//! paint the open job + the post/claim/settle affordances as cap-gated deos affordances.
//!
//! ## The substrate wrapped (consumed, not re-implemented)
//!
//! [`starbridge_compute_exchange`] — its life-of-cell [`job_program`] (the four organ caveats:
//! BUDGET `FieldLteField`, ACCEPTED `WriteOnce`, FLASHWELL `AffineEq`/`AffineLe`, LIFECYCLE
//! `StrictMonotonic`), its `post`/`bid`/`settle` turn-builders + `fire_bid`/`fire_settle` (the
//! cap∧state-gated fires through the embedded verified executor), and its slot schema. We consume
//! the whole job lifecycle + settlement; we re-implement neither. See the `[HONEST SCOPE]` note at
//! the bottom for what a fuller compute market (real GPU workers, a verifiable-compute proof of the
//! run, a wallet-to-wallet token transfer) adds.

// [HONEST SCOPE] — what this offering wraps, and what a fuller compute market adds.
//
// WRAPPED (consumed, not re-implemented): the compute-exchange substrate's whole job lifecycle —
// its life-of-cell `job_program` (BUDGET `FieldLteField`, ACCEPTED `WriteOnce`, FLASHWELL
// `AffineEq`/`AffineLe`, LIFECYCLE `StrictMonotonic`), its `build_post_action` post turn, and its
// cap∧state-gated `fire_bid`/`fire_settle` fires through the embedded verified executor. POST =
// `post` (escrow the budget), CLAIM = `bid` (a worker claims ≤ budget, cap-gated), SETTLE =
// `settle` (PAID := claim, REFUNDED := budget − claim, conserved). The refusals are the substrate's
// real teeth: a double-claim (POSTED precondition), an over-budget claim (`FieldLteField`), a
// non-conserving settle (`AffineEq`), a non-requester settle (cap gate). Conservation is the
// substrate's FLASHWELL: PAID + REFUNDED == BUDGET (Σδ = 0), field-accounting on the job cell — it
// is NOT a wallet-to-wallet `Effect::Transfer` between token balances (the substrate models the
// escrow split as committed cell fields, not moving `dregg-payable` balances). "The budget moves to
// the worker" means PAID (the worker's price) is credited on-ledger, refunded to the requester,
// with no mint/burn — the executor-enforced conservation, not a fungible token move.
//
// STUBBED: the confined EXECUTION. The worker's "result" is an offering-level attestation (the
// SUBMIT step folded into SETTLE via the settle affordance's `text`); it is NOT a real grain /
// ToolGateway confined run, and SETTLE checks only that a non-empty result was submitted, not that
// it is the correct output of the job spec. The `SPEC_HASH` seals the task description but no proof
// binds the result to it.
//
// A FULLER COMPUTE MARKET adds: real GPU/CPU workers running the job in a grain-turn / ToolGateway
// jail (a real metered confined execution, not a stubbed digest); a verifiable-compute proof that
// the submitted result is the correct output of the sealed spec (so SETTLE releases on a PROVEN
// result, not an attested one); a wallet-to-wallet token settlement via `Effect::Transfer` /
// `dregg-payable` (so value moves between real balances, not just cell fields); a metering /
// billing dimension (pay per unit of compute consumed, not a flat claim price); and a
// multi-worker / bidding market (many workers competing for a job, the requester picking the best
// price — this offering's one-claim-per-job is the substrate's WriteOnce(PROVIDER_HASH) single
// provider).
