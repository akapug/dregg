"""Conformance-PARITY harness for the drorb network orchestrator.

Turns "as complete as the reference edge/mesh engine" into a measurable NUMBER.

The companion `driver.py` proves what is *wired into the running serve* (its
46-scenario base suite). THIS harness ports the reference test suites' own
scenario catalogue — the behaviours, described in neutral RFC/protocol terms, NOT
any copied code — and drives drorb's real binaries so that, scenario for scenario,
drorb passes iff the reference's corresponding test asserts the same behaviour.

Each scenario carries a `ledger` tag pointing at the row in the PARITY-LEDGER it
reproduces. The verdict comes from the bytes the binaries emit, never narration.

Verdict semantics (identical to driver.py, so the two compose):
  PASS     drorb reproduces the behaviour the reference test asserts.
  FAIL     drorb is wired for it but produces the wrong / unsafe behaviour.
  UNWIRED  the reference covers it; drorb has it proven-in-isolation but it is
           not connected to the running serve (a MISSING/PARTIAL ledger row).
           Cited by ledger row — visible, not hidden.
  SKIPPED  could not be driven here (needs an external peer / harness / dep).

Groups ported (highest-value first, per the ledger's §4 scenario catalogue and
the task's http-semantics / smuggling / h2 / proxy / cache / mesh priority):
  http-semantics      curl_compliance + cq/tests behaviours over raw sockets
  smuggling           cq/tests_conformance CL/TE desync + malformed framing
  h2-conformance      h2spec_compliance — the RECONCILE (which binary keeps h2
                      alive, and the REAL number per path)
  proxy               reverse-proxy header hygiene (XFF / Via / hop-by-hop)
  cache               RFC 7234 hit / coalesce / no-store
  mesh                the self-contained live selftests (DISCO, DERP relay)

The remaining catalogue groups (h3/QPACK depth, DNS record types, control-plane,
transport cq/timers, TURN, netstack, pki) are enumerated as CATALOGUE rows mapped
to their ledger status so the parity DENOMINATOR is honest and complete.
