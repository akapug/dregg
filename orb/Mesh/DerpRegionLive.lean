# DerpRegionLive — driving the proven DERP region selection (no crypto, `me.*` inert)

The coordination server hands each node a **DERP map** of relay regions
(`Control.Derp.DerpMap` / `DerpRegion` — the distribution soundness proven in
`Control/Derp.lean`). A node then runs a `netcheck`-style latency probe against
those regions and picks its **home** region: the reachable region with the lowest
measured round-trip latency (the `preferredDERP` home). A region that is *down*
does not answer the probe, so it is simply absent from the latency report; when the
current home goes down, the node re-runs selection over the regions that remain and
**fails over** to the next lowest-latency reachable region.

Region selection is pure, inert, latency-arithmetic — **no crypto**. This module
models it as a total function over the ground-truth `Control.Derp` map, proves the
two selection properties, and drives them in a runnable selftest:

  * `derp_region_selects_reachable` — the selected home is a region that actually
    answered the probe (reachable), and no reachable region has lower latency; and
    if every probed region is a real member of the distributed map, the home is a
    genuine map region (`derp_home_is_map_region`).
  * `derp_region_failover` — after a region goes down (drops out of the report),
    the newly selected home is *not* the downed region, is still a genuinely
    reachable region, and is the lowest-latency region among those still up.

## Honesty / realization boundary

This is a `me.*`-inert, **no-crypto** lane: region selection is *client-side*
latency arithmetic (`netcheck` → `preferredDERP`), not a wire endpoint the
dataplane serves — there is nothing on a socket to open and no HTTP route to
`curl`. The selftest therefore drives the PROVEN pure selection on the real
`Control.Derp` map structures and cross-checks each decision against an independent
brute-force oracle (a fold that recomputes the minimum), witnessing on concrete
data exactly what `derp_region_selects_reachable` / `derp_region_failover` prove.
It calls **no** FFI and **no** crypto. (Finding: the deployed engine exposes no
region-selection endpoint to curl — this is correct; preferredDERP is a node-local
netcheck decision, not a served resource, so `prove-what-runs` here is the
interpreter run of the pure logic against the proof, quoted below.)

the downed region, (2) is still a genuinely reachable region of the original report,

losing the current home fails the node over to the next-best reachable region. -/
