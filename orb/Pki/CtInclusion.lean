Pki.CtInclusion — RFC 6962 §2.1.1 inclusion/consistency, verified, plus the
**inclusion depth** bound (row pk.13).

An RFC 6962 inclusion (audit) proof for the leaf at index `i` in a size-`n`
Merkle log is the list of sibling subtree heads on the root-to-leaf descent; a
monitor holding only the signed tree head recomputes the head from the leaf hash
and the path (`Ct.rootFromPath` / `Ct.verifyInclusion`).  The abstract soundness
of that verifier — a leaf verifies against the real head *iff* it is the genuine
`i`-th appended leaf — is `Ct.inclusion_iff`, discharged relative to an arbitrary
collision-resistant, domain-separated `Ct.HashScheme` (its `hleaf_inj` /
`hnode_inj` / `leaf_ne_node` fields are the *named* idealized-hash assumptions,
carried as structure parameters, so nothing here enlarges the axiom footprint —
no `Crypto` FFI is touched).  The concrete leaf input those verifiers consume is
`Pki.Ct.mtlHash = SHA-256(0x00 ‖ leaf)` (RFC 6962 §2.1); this module is
proof-only over the abstract scheme, so it never evaluates the real hash.

What this module ADDS beyond the existing soundness (`Ct.Inclusion`) and
consistency (`Ct.Consistency`) is the **depth** dimension:

  * `pathDepth n i` — the exact number of sibling hashes on the descent to leaf
    `i` in a size-`n` tree; `depth n` — the tree depth (max over all leaves).
  * `auditPath_length` — the honest audit path has length *exactly* `pathDepth`.
  * `rootFromPath_length` / `verifyInclusion_depth` — the verifier ACCEPTS a path
    only when its length equals `pathDepth n i`; the audit-path length is pinned
    to the geometry, so a padded or truncated path is rejected.
  * `pathDepth_lt` — `pathDepth n i < n`: verification cost is strictly below the
    leaf count (it terminates in fewer steps than there are leaves).
  * `pathDepth_le_depth` + `depth_ge_log` — every leaf's depth is ≤ the tree
    depth, and `n ≤ 2 ^ depth n`, i.e. the tree is genuinely (at least)
    logarithmically deep: an inclusion proof cannot commit more than `depth n`
    siblings, and `depth n ≥ log₂ n`.
  * `inclusion_rejects_wrong_length` / `inclusion_rejects_overlong` — a proof of
    the wrong depth (in particular any proof at least as long as the tree) is
    rejected; a forger cannot pad an audit path to fake inclusion.

The three RFC-headline theorems are re-exported under stable names for the
ledger: `ct_inclusion_verifies`, `ct_inclusion_rejects_forged`, `ct_consistency`.
Non-vacuity is discharged against a concrete, genuinely collision-resistant
scheme (the free Merkle-digest term algebra `Demo.DH`): a real audit path
verifies, a forged leaf is rejected for *every* path, and an over-long forged
path is rejected by the depth bound.

`pathDepth n i` counts the sibling hashes a size-`n` audit path for leaf `i`
carries — one per interior node on the root-to-leaf descent.  It mirrors the
split-recursion of `Ct.auditPath` / `Ct.rootFromPath` exactly, so it is the
common measure of both the honest proof length and the verifier's step count. -/

depth is strictly less than the leaf count: verification consumes fewer siblings
than there are leaves, so it always terminates well below a linear bound. -/

(so `depth n ≥ log₂ n`).  Combined with `pathDepth_le_depth`, an audit path for a
size-`n` log carries at most `depth n` siblings and the depth is bounded below by
the log of the leaf count — the Merkle structure is a genuine balanced tree, not a
degenerate list a malicious log could inflate. -/

abstraction, realized structurally), not a degenerate all-equal hash.  A genuine
audit path verifies; a forged leaf is rejected for every path; an over-long
forged path is rejected by the depth bound. -/
