# Pki.ChainBuild — X.509 certification path building & validation, verified.

RFC 5280 §6.1 defines the certification path validation algorithm: given an end-
entity ("leaf") certificate, a sequence of intermediate CA certificates, and a
store of trust anchors ("roots"), decide whether the leaf chains to a trusted
root. This module is the verified **decision logic** of that algorithm — the
path-building and constraint-checking half — over an abstract, honest model of
the cryptographic pieces.

The three structural obligations a valid path must satisfy (RFC 5280 §6.1.3):

  * **Signature chaining.** Each certificate is signed by the next certificate up
    the path (the leaf by an intermediate, each intermediate by the one above,
    the top by a trust anchor). The signature *check itself* is cryptography; we
    do NOT reinvent it. It is modeled as an **opaque oracle** `signatureValid
    parent child` — an uninterpreted total predicate whose outputs are never
    computed here, only threaded through as hypotheses. This is the faithful
    boundary: the proofs establish the path-building logic *around* a
    signature-verification primitive, never assuming anything about how it
    decides.
  * **Name chaining** (RFC 5280 §6.1.3(a)(4)). The `issuer` of each certificate
    equals the `subject` of the certificate that signed it.
  * **Basic constraints** (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.9 / §6.1.4(k)). Every certificate used
    as a CA — i.e. every non-leaf certificate in the path, and the trust anchor —
    must assert `basicConstraints: cA = TRUE`. A leaf presented as its own issuer
    must NOT be honored; the mutant below shows this check is load-bearing.

Plus temporal validity (RFC 5280 §6.1.3(a)(2)): every certificate on the path
must be within its `notBefore … notAfter` window at validation time `now`.

Headline theorems (core axioms only; the signature oracle is an opaque def, not
an axiom):

  * `chain_builds_to_root` — a leaf + intermediate that name-chain to a self-
    signed trusted root, all in-window, all CA flags set, and whose signatures
    verify under the oracle, is ACCEPTED. `chain_builds_to_root_example` pins it
    to concrete certificates so the only remaining hypotheses are the three
    opaque signature checks (maximally non-vacuous).
  * `chain_rejects_no_root` — a path whose terminal certificate is not a trusted
    root (not in the store, not self-signed, or not a CA) is REJECTED, for a path
    of ANY length.
  * `chain_rejects_expired` — a path containing ANY certificate outside its
    validity window at `now` is REJECTED.
  * `mutant_ca_is_load_bearing` / `mutant_noCA_accepts_forgery` — the mutant:
    dropping the basicConstraints CA check accepts a forged path through a non-CA
    "intermediate" that the real `verifyPath` rejects. Proves the CA constraint
    is not decorative.

Two soundness projections carry the weight:

  * `verifyPath_all_valid` — acceptance implies every certificate on the path is
    temporally valid.
  * `verifyPath_last_trusted` — acceptance implies the terminal certificate is a
    trusted root.

/-! ## Model

Distinguished names, public keys, and times are abstract identifiers; the model
turns on the *relations* between them (name chaining, temporal ordering), not
their byte encodings, which are a separate parsing concern. -/

/-- A distinguished name (RFC 5280 §4.1.2.4/§4.1.2.6), abstractly an identifier.
Two certificates name-chain when one's `issuer` equals the other's `subject`. -/
abbrev Name := Nat

/-- A point in time (seconds since epoch, abstractly a `Nat`). -/
abbrev Time := Nat

/-- An X.509 certificate, reduced to the fields the path algorithm inspects. The
signature bytes and TBS encoding are abstracted behind the `signatureValid`
oracle, so no signature field appears here. -/
structure Cert where
  /-- The certificate's subject DN (RFC 5280 §4.1.2.6). -/
  subject   : Name
  /-- The issuing CA's DN (RFC 5280 §4.1.2.4); must equal the signer's `subject`. -/
  issuer    : Name
  /-- `basicConstraints: cA` (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.9): may this cert sign others? -/
  isCA      : Bool
  /-- Validity `notBefore` (RFC 5280 §4.1.2.5). -/
  notBefore : Time
  /-- Validity `notAfter` (RFC 5280 §4.1.2.5). -/
  notAfter  : Time
deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **The opaque signature-verification oracle.** `signatureValid parent child`
means: `child`'s signature verifies under `parent`'s public key (RFC 5280
§6.1.3(a)(1)). This stands in for the real cryptographic primitive (RSA/ECDSA/
EdDSA). It is deliberately *uninterpreted*: this module proves nothing about how
signatures verify, only how the path algorithm composes the primitive's verdict.
As an `opaque` definition it contributes no axiom; its values enter proofs only
as explicit hypotheses. -/

`child`, the names chain, and `parent` is a CA permitted to issue. -/

(last). The empty path has no anchor and is rejected; a singleton must be a
trusted root; otherwise the head must be in-window and link to the next, which is
itself a valid sub-path. -/

/-! ## The mutant: basicConstraints CA is load-bearing

a mutant validator that drops the CA check accepts the forgery. -/
