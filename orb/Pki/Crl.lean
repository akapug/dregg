# Pki.Crl — X.509 CRL parse + revocation decision (RFC 5280), verified.

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a signed, periodically-issued list naming
the certificates a CA has revoked before their scheduled expiry. A relying party
that trusts a certificate must consult a current CRL: if the certificate's serial
number appears on the list, the certificate is revoked and MUST be rejected; and
if the CRL itself is out of date (its `nextUpdate` time has passed), it can no
longer be trusted to reflect fresh revocations and MUST NOT be relied upon
(RFC 5280 §6.3.3). Getting this decision logic right is the security-relevant
part: a stale CRL can silently hide a revocation that happened after it was
issued.

This module is the concrete, verified model of that parse-and-decide pipeline.
It follows the same discipline as `Pki.OcspResponse`: concrete byte-level
structures and a signature-verify **oracle** carried as a named assumption (a
`Prop`, never a fresh Lean axiom), so the machine-checked content is the parse
and the revocation/freshness decision — the crypto primitive itself is out of
scope and is not reinvented here.

What is concrete here:

  * **The `TBSCertList` byte layout** (RFC 5280 §5.1.2): the `thisUpdate` /
    `nextUpdate` `Time` fields (`GeneralizedTime`/`UTCTime` octet strings) and the
    `revokedCertificates` `SEQUENCE OF`, each revoked entry keyed by its
    `userCertificate` serial (a DER `INTEGER` TLV, RFC 5280 §5.1.2.6 / §4.1.2.2).
  * **The CRL parse** — a `Bytes → Option TBSCertList` decoder with a proven
    encode/parse roundtrip: the parser recovers exactly the `thisUpdate`,
    `nextUpdate`, and the list of revoked serials the issuer encoded.
  * **The freshness gate** (RFC 5280 §6.3.3): the relying party stops trusting a
    CRL once the current time is outside `[thisUpdate, nextUpdate]`.
  * **The accept/reject decision** — accept a certificate only when the issuer's
    signature over the `tbsCertList` verifies, the CRL is fresh, and the
    certificate's serial is *not* on the revoked list.

Headline theorems (all core-axioms-only — no crypto axiom is composed in; the
signature verifier is an opaque parameter / named `Prop` assumption):

  * `crl_parses` — an encoded `TBSCertList` parses back to exactly the
    `thisUpdate`/`nextUpdate` and the list of revoked serials the issuer wrote
    (RFC 5280 §5.1.2): the parse never drops, reorders, or invents a serial.
  * `crl_revoked_rejected` — a certificate whose serial is on the CRL is rejected,
    even when the CRL signature verifies and the CRL is fresh. Revocation is
    terminal.
  * `crl_stale_rejected` — a CRL whose `nextUpdate` has passed is not trusted:
    the certificate is rejected (conservative hard-fail) even for a
    signature-valid CRL that does not list the serial (RFC 5280 §6.3.3). The
    freshness gate is load-bearing: a mutant that drops it trusts an expired CRL
    that the real check rejects.
  * `crl_forged_rejected` — under issuer authenticity (the EUF-CMA functional
    shadow), a CRL the issuer never signed is not trusted: the opaque signature
    oracle is what stands between a forged "empty" CRL and acceptance of a
    revoked certificate.

namespace Pki.Crl

/-! ## Bytes -/

/-- A byte string. -/
abbrev Bytes := List UInt8

/-- A certificate serial number, modeled as its DER `INTEGER` content octets
(RFC 5280 §4.1.2.2: serials are up to 20 octets). -/

```text

  userCertificate   CertificateSerialNumber,
  revocationDate    Time,
  crlEntryExtensions Extensions OPTIONAL } OPTIONAL
```

The security-relevant projection of that list is the multiset of revoked
serials. Each serial is encoded on the wire as a DER `INTEGER` TLV: tag `0x02`,
a short-form length octet, then the content octets. `encodeSerials` lays a list
of serials down as the concatenation of their TLVs (the flattened `SEQUENCE OF`
content), and `parseSerials` recovers it. -/

/-! ## The `Time` fields and the `TBSCertList`

`thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate` are X.509 `Time` values — `UTCTime` or
`GeneralizedTime` **octet strings** on the wire (RFC 5280 §5.1.2.4 / §5.1.2.5),
not integers. We carry them as their raw octets and recover them verbatim; each
is laid down length-prefixed. -/

(RFC 5280 §5.1.2): the two `Time` octet strings and the revoked serials. -/

  let (tu, r1) ← parseField b

  some { thisUpdate := tu, nextUpdate := nu, revoked := rev }

/-! ## The freshness window — RFC 5280 §6.3.3

The relying party interprets the two `Time` fields to a numeric window and
requires the current time to lie within `[thisUpdate, nextUpdate]`. Times are
modeled as `Nat` seconds since an epoch (the decoded view of the octet fields,
exactly as `Pki.OcspResponse.Window` carries decoded times). -/

/-- The validity window of a CRL. -/

  /-- `thisUpdate`: the CRL is issued as of this time. -/
  thisUpdate : Nat
  /-- `nextUpdate`: the CRL is stale after this time. -/
  nextUpdate : Nat

/-- **The freshness gate (RFC 5280 §6.3.3).** A CRL is fresh at `now` iff
`thisUpdate ≤ now ≤ nextUpdate`. -/

  decide (w.thisUpdate ≤ now ∧ now ≤ w.nextUpdate)

/-! ## The signature-verify oracle

The issuer signs the `tbsCertList` (RFC 5280 §5.1.1.3). Verifying that signature
is a crypto primitive kept behind a named boundary — a `Verifier` function
supplied by the caller — exactly as `Pki.OcspResponse` routes responder
signatures through an abstract `Verifier`. The machine-checked content is the
decision logic *around* the oracle, not the primitive. -/

/-- A signature verifier: `verify key msg sig` decides whether `sig` is a valid
signature of `msg` under the CRL issuer's public key. -/
abbrev Verifier := ByteArray → ByteArray → ByteArray → Bool

/-! ## A CRL (for the decision) and the accept/reject verdict -/

the issuer's signature over the `tbsCertList` verifies, the CRL is fresh
(RFC 5280 §6.3.3), and the certificate's serial is not on the revoked list. An
invalid signature, a stale CRL, or a listed serial all reject. -/

`thisUpdate`, `nextUpdate`, and the list of revoked serials the issuer wrote
(RFC 5280 §5.1.2) — under the short-form bound on the `Time` fields and every
serial. The parse is a left inverse of the encoder: it never drops, reorders,
truncates, or invents a serial, and it recovers the validity-window `Time`
octets verbatim. -/

/-- **crl_revoked_rejected.** A certificate whose serial is on the CRL is
rejected — even in the best case for the certificate, where the issuer's
signature verifies and the CRL is fresh. Revocation is terminal: no other field
can rescue a listed certificate. -/

/-- **crl_stale_rejected.** A CRL whose `nextUpdate` has passed (`nextUpdate <
now`) is stale and not trusted: the certificate is rejected (conservative
hard-fail) even for a signature-valid CRL that does not list the serial. Without
this gate an expired CRL — which cannot reflect revocations issued after it —
would be trusted, masking a fresh revocation (RFC 5280 §6.3.3). -/

`crl_revoked_rejected` and `crl_stale_rejected` would be vacuous if `checkCert`
rejected everything. It does not: a signature-valid, fresh CRL that does not list

def acceptAll : Verifier := fun _ _ _ => true

/-! ## A mutant: dropping the freshness gate is unsound

The freshness gate in `checkCert` is load-bearing. `checkCertNoFresh` is
`checkCert` with the `isFresh` clause removed; it trusts a stale CRL that
`checkCert` rejects. The disagreement witnesses that `crl_stale_rejected` is
testing a real behavior, not a tautology. -/

/-- **mutant_disagrees.** On the stale CRL the mutant (no freshness gate) ACCEPTS
the unrevoked serial while the real `checkCert` REJECTS it — the freshness gate
changes the verdict, so `crl_stale_rejected` guards a real behavior. -/

/-! ## Issuer authenticity — the forged-CRL reject (EUF-CMA shadow)

The opaque signature oracle is what separates a forged CRL from acceptance.
`IssuerAuthentic` is the functional shadow of the issuer key's unforgeability,
stated exactly as `Pki.OcspResponse.ResponderAuthentic` is: under the issuer's
key, the verifier accepts a `(message, signature)` only when the issuer actually
signed that message. It is a per-issuer `Prop` hypothesis, never a Lean axiom. -/

/-- **Issuer authenticity (EUF-CMA functional shadow).** Under key `key`, the
verifier accepts `(tbs, sig)` only when `signed tbs` — the issuer genuinely
signed those `tbsCertList` bytes. -/
def IssuerAuthentic (verify : Verifier) (key : ByteArray)
    (signed : ByteArray → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ tbs sig, verify key tbs sig = true → signed tbs

/-- **crl_forged_rejected.** Under issuer authenticity for a key that signed only
genuine `tbsCertList` bytes, a CRL carrying `tbs` the issuer never signed causes
the certificate to be rejected — a forged or substituted CRL (e.g. a fabricated
empty list that omits a real revocation) never verifies against the honest
issuer's key, so it can never be trusted to accept a certificate. -/
