# Cache.HitProven — the DEPLOYED cache hit/miss serve, proven on the wire

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for the ledger row `ca.hit` (cache hit/miss serving). The running
dataplane's cache lives in `crates/dataplane/src/cache.rs` (the hot tier) and
`crates/dataplane/src/cache_disk.rs` (the durable cold tier). Both realize the
sans-IO model already proven in `Cache.lean` / `Cache/Disk.lean` (RFC 9111 §4.2):
a stored response is served while `current_age < freshness_lifetime`, a stale
entry reads as a miss, and a miss forwards to the origin then stores.

This module pins the property the running wire actually shows, combining the
proven store (`Cache.Disk`) with a faithful byte-level model of the deployed
**stamp**: on a fresh hit the shell splices, right after the status line,

    X-Cache: HIT\r\n
    Age: <current_age>\r\n

leaving the stored response bytes otherwise byte-for-byte (`cache.rs::stamp`,
`cache_disk.rs::stamp_hit`). `current_age = now − stored_at` is exactly
`Cache.Disk.DiskEntry.age`.

## What is proven (each maps to what the deployed engine emits)

* **`cache_hit_serves_stored`** — a FRESH stored entry is served: `getFresh`
  returns it (the proven store), and the wire the shell writes is
  `status ++ CRLF ++ "X-Cache: HIT" ++ "Age: <now−stored_at>" ++ rest` — the
  `Age` header carries the current age and the stored response tail (`rest`,
  the headers/blank-line/body) is preserved verbatim. This is the second
  `curl` a client sees: the HIT.
* **`cache_miss_fetches`** — a MISS is NOT served from the cache (`getFresh`
  misses), so the deployed leader runs the fold (contacts the origin) and its
  `cacheStore` writes the fetched response under the proven key + lifetime; the
  next request within the lifetime then HITs, serving the fetched body stamped.
  This is the first `curl` (the MISS that populates) followed by the hit.
* **`cache_no_stale_past_ttl`** — a stored entry PAST its TTL is not served
  stale: `getFresh` returns `none` (the deployed `get_fresh` drops the file and
  re-fetches / revalidates), so no stale body ever reaches the wire.

The scan-faithful `stampHit` mirrors the Rust `find(resp, b"\r\n")` splice; the
three store facts are `Cache.Disk.disk_getFresh_put`, the miss/round-trip
composition, and `Cache.Disk.disk_getFresh_put_expired`.

/-! ## Theorem 1 — a fresh cached entry is served with the Age header + stored body -/

/-- **`cache_hit_serves_stored`.** A FRESH stored entry is served: the proven
store returns it (`disk_getFresh_put`), and the deployed wire is
`status ++ CRLF ++ "X-Cache: HIT" ++ "Age: <now−stored_at>" ++ rest`. The `Age`
header carries the current age (`e.age now = now − e.storedAt`), and the stored
response tail `rest` (headers, blank line, body) is preserved byte-for-byte. This
is the HIT a client sees on the second request. -/

/-! ## Theorem 2 — a miss goes to the origin, then stores; the next request hits -/

/-- **`cache_miss_fetches`.** On a cold key the cache does NOT serve
(`serveCache … = none`, `getFresh` misses), so the deployed leader forwards to the
origin and its `cacheStore` writes the fetched response `eF` under the proven key.
The next request within the lifetime then HITs, serving the fetched body stamped —
exactly the first-`curl`-MISS-then-second-`curl`-HIT sequence. -/

/-! ## Theorem 3 — a past-TTL entry is not served stale -/

/-- **`cache_no_stale_past_ttl`.** A stored entry PAST its freshness lifetime
(`e.fresh now = false`) is NOT served: `serveCache … = none` — the deployed
`get_fresh` reads it as a miss, drops the file, and re-fetches / revalidates. No
stale body ever reaches the wire (RFC 9111 §4.2, `disk_getFresh_put_expired`). -/

/-! ## Non-vacuous checks on a real deployed static response

A concrete `GET /static/app.js`-style 200 with a `max-age=60` directive, exercised
through the deployed serve: the first request misses, the entry is fresh, and the
served HIT carries `X-Cache: HIT` and `Age: 7` (age = now − stored_at) with the
body `hello` preserved. Real bytes, `decide`/`rfl`, not a vacuous instantiation. -/
