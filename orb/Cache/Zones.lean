# Cache.Zones — partitioned cache zones (RFC 9111 storage, isolated partitions)

The `Cache` library models one shared (proxy) HTTP cache: a bounded LRU `Store`
with freshness, coalescing, and revalidation (the *hot* tier), and `Cache.Disk`
adds the durable *cold* tier. Both are a single, undivided pool: eviction
pressure anywhere competes with every entry everywhere.

This module adds **zones**: the cache is partitioned into independent named
partitions, each with its own byte / entry budget and its own LRU eviction. A
cache key is routed to a zone by a `zoneOf` partitioner (e.g. by host / route),
and eviction is *zone-local* — a burst that overflows one zone evicts only that
zone's least-recently-used entries and can never displace another zone's data.

RFC 9111 §3 permits a cache to bound its storage and evict; nothing there
requires one global pool. Zones realize the bound *per partition* so a hot,
churny tenant (one host) cannot starve a cold, valuable one. This is the model
behind a per-zone size limit: a tenant gets a guaranteed slice, isolated from
its neighbours' pressure.

## The model

* `ZEntry` — a zone entry: the reused `Cache.Key` + opaque `Cache.Body` payload
  token, plus the byte `size` the zone's byte budget accounts. `ZEntry.ofStored`
  adapts an in-memory `Cache.Stored` into a zone entry, so a zone composes over
  the reused hot-tier entry type.
* `Zone` — one partition: its `entries` (most-recently-used first, exactly the
  hot-tier `Cache.Store` recency discipline), a `maxBytes` and a `maxEntries`
  budget. `Zone.put` prepends (MRU) and drops any prior entry for the key;
  `Zone.evict` drops least-recently-used entries (from the tail) until the zone
  is within *both* budgets.
* `ZonedCache` — the top-level partitioner: a finite map `ZoneId → Zone`.
  `ZonedCache.put`/`get?` route through a `Config.zoneOf` to the owning zone and
  operate zone-locally.

## The theorems (0 sorries; axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice})

* `zone_isolation` — **the partitioning property**: putting (and evicting) in the
  zone that owns `e` leaves *every other* zone's contents bit-for-bit unchanged.
  `zone_isolation_get`: a lookup in another zone is entirely unaffected. So
  eviction pressure in one zone cannot evict another zone's entries.
* `zone_evict_respects_limit` — a zone's eviction brings it within *both* its
  byte budget and its entry budget (`bytes ≤ maxBytes ∧ count ≤ maxEntries`).
* `zone_get_put` — get-after-put within a zone returns the stored entry.
* `zone_lru_evicts_oldest` — eviction drops the least-recently-used entries: the
  kept set is a *prefix* of the entries (the most-recently-used), so what is
  dropped is exactly the LRU tail. A concrete two-entry truth table nails it.

A non-vacuous truth table (`§ demo`) puts pressure on one zone (entry budget 1,
two entries) and asserts the *other* zone's entry survives untouched while the
pressured zone evicts its LRU entry.

/-! ## Zone-local LRU / size eviction

Evict least-recently-used entries — the tail, since the head is MRU — until the
zone is within *both* budgets. When a zone is over budget it is non-empty (an
empty zone has 0 bytes and 0 entries, within any budget), so each step strictly
shrinks it; the recursion terminates and the postcondition holds (worst case:
the zone empties, which is trivially within budget). -/

/-- Fuel-driven eviction: each step drops the LRU tail (`dropLast`) while the
list is over either budget. `fuel = es.length` is enough steps to empty the list
in the worst case (each step shrinks it by one), so `evictTo` below always
reaches a within-budget fixpoint. Structural on `fuel` — it reduces in the
