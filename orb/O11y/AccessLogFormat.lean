# O11y.AccessLogFormat — the deployed access-log wire line, proven

The plaintext HTTP serve path (both the blocking reactor and the io_uring
reactor) emits, when opt-in access logging is enabled, exactly one compact
`key=val` line per served request:

```text
ts=<iso8601> client=<ip> method=<m> path=<p> status=<code> backend=<b> bytes=<n> dur_us=<d>
```

The eight fields appear in that fixed order, separated by single spaces, and the
line is terminated by a single newline. Two of the fields — `method` and `path`
— carry attacker-influenced request bytes and are *sanitised* before they reach
the line: every control character and every space is replaced by `_`, the field
is capped at 2048 characters, and an ellipsis marks truncation. The remaining
fields are host-owned (timestamp, peer address, status code, dialled upstream,
byte count, elapsed microseconds).

This module models that line and the sanitiser faithfully and proves two
properties of the wire the host actually writes:

* `access_log_line_wellformed` — a rendered line carries exactly the eight
  required keys, in order, and every key resolves to its intended value
  (`client`, `method`, `path`, `status`, `bytes`, `dur_us`, and the `ts` /
  `backend` frame fields). The record is structured and each field is
  addressable by name.

* `access_log_no_crlf_injection` — a `method` or `path` bearing a carriage
  return or line feed — the two bytes that terminate a line and could forge a
  second, fabricated record — cannot survive into the rendered field: the
  sanitiser maps them (as control bytes) to `_`. Log injection is impossible by
  construction, for any input whatsoever.

All proofs are core Lean — no `native_decide` in a headline theorem — so the
axiom footprint is empty (checked with `#print axioms`). The concrete `#guard`s
pin a `GET /health` line to the exact field set the running dataplane emits, so
the proof and the deployed wire are the same object.

/-! ## The sanitiser (mirrors the deployed field sanitiser)

The deployed sanitiser keeps one field on one line and space-free: it replaces
every control character and every space with `_`, keeps at most 2048 characters,
and appends `…` when it truncated. A character is *control* on the Unicode C0
range `U+0000..U+001F` and the C1 range `U+007F..U+009F` — exactly Rust's
`char::is_control`. Carriage return (`U+000D`) and line feed (`U+000A`) are both
C0 control bytes, which is what makes injection impossible. -/

/-- Is `c` a Unicode control character (C0 `U+00..U+1F` or C1 `U+7F..U+9F`)? -/
def isControl (c : Char) : Bool :=
  c.val ≤ 0x1f || (0x7f ≤ c.val && c.val ≤ 0x9f)

/-- Map one field character: a control character or a space becomes `_`; every
other character passes through unchanged. -/
def sanitizeChar (c : Char) : Char :=
  match isControl c || c == ' ' with
  | true  => '_'
  | false => c

/-- Sanitise a field value: replace control/space characters, cap the length at
2048 characters, and mark truncation with `…`. -/
def sanitize (s : String) : String :=
  let cs := s.data
  let kept := (cs.take 2048).map sanitizeChar
  ⟨if cs.length > 2048 then kept ++ ['…'] else kept⟩

/-! ## No control byte can survive the sanitiser -/

/-- The sanitiser never yields a raw CR or LF: whatever the input character, the
result is neither `'\n'` nor `'\r'`. (A control input becomes `_`; a non-control
input is left as-is but is then by definition not a control byte, and CR/LF are
control bytes.) -/

A real health-probe request renders to a concrete field set. These `#guard`s
pin the field keys and the exact `GET /health` values to the line the running

are the same. -/
