# L4.Splice — the zero-copy layer-4 relay (a model of the kernel `splice`)

`Reactor.L4` moves an L4 stream verbatim, but through the reactor's *copy*
vocabulary: every client chunk becomes a `submitSendUpstream fd d` and every
upstream chunk a `submitSend d` — the bytes `d` ride in the submission, i.e.
they are materialized in the process's address space on the way through. That
is the plain relay: correct, but it pays one userspace copy per chunk per
direction.

This file models the *zero-copy* relay: the bytes never enter userspace at
all. In the kernel, `splice(2)` moves data between a file descriptor and a
pipe without a userspace round-trip; a full fd→fd relay is a pair of splices,
`socket → pipe` (the **pull** phase) and `pipe → socket` (the **push** phase),
run continuously per direction until end-of-stream. A connection carries two
pipes — one per direction — so four kernel byte-streams (client fd, upstream
fd, and the two pipe buffers), and the relay is a schedule of splice
operations over them. The operation the relay issues is `splice src dst len`:
a *source* fd, a *destination* fd, and a length. It carries **no bytes** — the
whole point.

Two properties are proven here.

**`splice_relay_faithful`** — for *both* directions, when the relay has drained
(source fds at EOF and pipes emptied), the bytes delivered to each destination
fd equal that direction's source stream, verbatim and in order. The proof is a
kernel-side conservation law: `atDst ++ inPipe ++ atSrc` is invariant under
every pull and every push, so once `inPipe` and `atSrc` are empty, `atDst` is
the whole original stream. This holds for *any* schedule of pull/push
operations with *any* chunk sizes and *any* interleaving of the two
directions — not a fixed ceremony. A pull that dropped a byte, a push that
reordered the pipe, or a stray extra splice would each break the invariant.

**`splice_no_userspace_copy`** — the relay's emitted operation stream
materializes zero bytes in userspace. The op language *can* express a userspace
copy (`RelayOp.userCopy dst data`, the plain-relay alternative — bytes in the
op), and the byte-footprint projection charges exactly those bytes; the splice
relay emits only `RelayOp.splice`, whose footprint is empty, so the whole
relay's footprint is `[]`. `userCopy_would_materialize` is the contrast: the
same projection over a plain-relay op carrying real bytes is non-empty — the
copy the splice path removes.

`pump_faithful` / `pump_relay_faithful` discharge the drained hypotheses with a
concrete, whole-stream schedule, so the faithfulness theorems are witnessed on
real inputs rather than asserted vacuously.

**Follow-on (named, not modeled here).** The syscall shell wiring: on the
Linux `io_uring` datapath, per accepted L4 connection issue `pipe2(O_NONBLOCK)`
twice (one pipe per direction) and submit the initial `IORING_OP_SPLICE`
socket→pipe pull for each direction, with a completion tag encoding
`(client_fd, direction, phase)`; on each completion, chain the opposite phase
(pull→push→pull…), treating `bytes_moved == 0` as EOF and applying the
per-direction half-close (`shutdown(SHUT_WR)` on the paired socket, full close
once both directions have seen EOF). That is the `submit_splice` /
`on_splice_complete` shell driving exactly the schedule this file proves
faithful; it is C/Rust FFI against the ring, out of the Lean TCB.

/-! ## The kernel byte-move operation the relay emits

The relay issues `splice src dst len` — fd numbers and a length, **no
payload**. `userCopy` is the *plain* relay's alternative (the copy the
zero-copy path exists to remove): it carries the bytes. Keeping both in one
type makes "materializes nothing" a real claim about a language that *could*
materialize, not a triviality. -/
