# L4.UdpRelay — connectionless (UDP) layer-4 datagram relay

The TCP L4 splice moves a *stream*: accept, dial an upstream, then move an
ordered byte stream verbatim in both directions until each half closes. UDP has
no connection and no stream — it moves *datagrams*, each an independent,
boundary-preserved message with no ordering guarantee between them. A UDP L4
relay is therefore built around a **session table** rather than a per-connection
state machine: the listener keys each client by its transport flow, binds that
flow to a freshly chosen upstream target (with its own upstream socket `fd`),
and from then on every datagram of that flow is forwarded, verbatim and boundary
preserved, to the same upstream — replies coming back on that `fd` return to the
originating client flow.

Three properties are proven here, over the relay's own datagram step:

* **`udp_relay_faithful`** — the relay is verbatim in *both* directions. Over any
  trace, the list of datagrams forwarded upstream is exactly the list of client
  datagrams (payload for payload, boundaries preserved, order kept), and the list
  of datagrams returned to the client is exactly the list of upstream replies. A
  relay that split, coalesced, dropped, reordered, or rewrote a datagram would
  break one of these two equalities. (The reply direction is stated over the
  well-formed traces where every reply arrives on a `fd` the relay actually
  opened — replies from an unbound `fd` are dropped, never misdelivered.)

* **`udp_relay_flow`** — a transport flow maps to *one* consistent upstream. The
  first datagram of a flow binds it to a chosen upstream `fd`; every later
  datagram of the *same* flow forwards to that same `fd` and upstream target,
  never re-choosing. So the datagrams of one flow all reach one backend — session
  affinity, proven, not a fresh pick per packet.

* **`udp_relay_no_amplification`** — the relay never sends more bytes upstream
  than it received from the client. Each client datagram forwards to at most one
  upstream datagram carrying the *same* payload, and nothing else emits an
  upstream datagram, so the total upstream byte count is bounded by the total
  client byte count. A relay that duplicated, padded, or retransmitted a datagram
  could be turned into a traffic amplifier; this rules that out.

The relay is parametric in an upstream `Pool`; the concrete selection here is a
round-robin over the pool keyed by a per-new-flow generation counter (any pure
selection would do — the affinity theorem holds regardless, because the *binding*
pins the choice, not the selector).
