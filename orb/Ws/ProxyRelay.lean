# WebSocket proxy relay (RFC 6455 §5, §7) — bidirectional frame relay

A WebSocket proxy sits between a client and an upstream server and relays
decoded frames (`Ws.Frame`: FIN, opcode, unmasked payload) in both directions:
client→upstream and upstream→client. This module fixes the relay as a pure
per-direction transform and proves the three properties a transparent relay must
satisfy:

* **Faithful** (`ws_relay_faithful`) — the frames a direction emits are a verbatim
  prefix of the frames it received: identical frames, identical order, nothing
  rewritten. Both directions independently.
* **Close-propagating and halting** (`ws_relay_close`) — a Close control frame is
  forwarded to the peer, and the relay in that direction stops: every frame that
  arrived after the Close is dropped (§7.1.1 — no traffic after Close).
* **No injection** (`ws_relay_no_inject`) — every frame the relay emits arrived on
  the corresponding input stream; the relay originates no frames of its own.

The relay is byte-transparent at the frame layer: a forwarded frame is the same
`Frame` record, so its payload bytes are identical. Deliberately out of scope:
the close *handshake* state machine (that is `Ws.Close`); this module is the
data-plane relay that carries frames between the two `Ws.Close` endpoints.

/-! ## Per-direction core lemmas -/

/-- The relayed stream is a **verbatim prefix** of the input stream: the emitted
frames are exactly the input frames, in order, up to the truncation point —
nothing is rewritten or reordered. -/
theorem relayDir_prefix (xs : List Frame) : relayDir xs <+: xs := by
  induction xs with
  | nil => exact List.nil_prefix

/-- With no Close frame present, the relay is the **identity**: every frame is
forwarded verbatim, the full stream passes through. -/
theorem relayDir_no_close (xs : List Frame)
    (h : ∀ f ∈ xs, f.opcode ≠ Opcode.close) : relayDir xs = xs := by

/-- **Close propagation + halt (per direction).** If a stream is `pre ++ f ::
post` where `pre` carries no Close and `f` is a Close frame, the relay forwards
exactly `pre ++ [f]`: the Close `f` is propagated to the peer, and every frame in
`post` (everything after the Close) is dropped. -/

/-! ## Headline theorems — the bidirectional relay contract -/

/-- **`ws_relay_faithful`.** In *both* directions the proxy relays frames
verbatim: the frames delivered to the upstream are a prefix of the frames the
client sent, and the frames delivered to the client are a prefix of the frames
the upstream sent — identical frames, identical order, no rewriting. -/
theorem ws_relay_faithful (d : Duplex) :
    (relay d).toUpstream <+: d.c2u ∧ (relay d).toClient <+: d.u2c :=
  ⟨relayDir_prefix d.c2u, relayDir_prefix d.u2c⟩

/-- Sharpened faithfulness: on a Close-free connection the relay is the exact
identity in both directions — every frame passes through untouched. -/
theorem ws_relay_faithful_exact (d : Duplex)
    (hc2u : ∀ f ∈ d.c2u, f.opcode ≠ Opcode.close)
    (hu2c : ∀ f ∈ d.u2c, f.opcode ≠ Opcode.close) :
    (relay d).toUpstream = d.c2u ∧ (relay d).toClient = d.u2c :=
  ⟨relayDir_no_close d.c2u hc2u, relayDir_no_close d.u2c hu2c⟩

/-- **`ws_relay_close`.** A Close frame is propagated to the peer and the relay
halts. If the client sends `pre ++ close :: post` (with `pre` Close-free), the
proxy forwards exactly `pre ++ [close]` to the upstream: the Close crosses, and
every frame after it (`post`) is dropped. The upstream→client direction is the
symmetric statement `ws_relay_close_clientward`. -/
theorem ws_relay_close (d : Duplex) (pre post : List Frame) (f : Frame)
    (hc2u : d.c2u = pre ++ f :: post)
    (hpre : ∀ g ∈ pre, g.opcode ≠ Opcode.close)
    (hf : f.opcode = Opcode.close) :
    (relay d).toUpstream = pre ++ [f] := by
  simp only [relay, hc2u]
  exact relayDir_close pre f post hpre hf

/-- The symmetric direction: a Close from the upstream is propagated to the
client and the client-ward relay halts, dropping every following frame. -/
theorem ws_relay_close_clientward (d : Duplex) (pre post : List Frame) (f : Frame)
    (hu2c : d.u2c = pre ++ f :: post)
    (hpre : ∀ g ∈ pre, g.opcode ≠ Opcode.close)
    (hf : f.opcode = Opcode.close) :
    (relay d).toClient = pre ++ [f] := by
  simp only [relay, hu2c]
  exact relayDir_close pre f post hpre hf

/-- **`ws_relay_no_inject`.** The relay adds no frames of its own: every frame
delivered to the upstream arrived from the client, and every frame delivered to
the client arrived from the upstream. -/
theorem ws_relay_no_inject (d : Duplex) {f : Frame} :
    (f ∈ (relay d).toUpstream → f ∈ d.c2u) ∧
    (f ∈ (relay d).toClient → f ∈ d.u2c) :=
  ⟨fun h => relayDir_subset d.c2u h, fun h => relayDir_subset d.u2c h⟩

/-! ## Non-vacuity witnesses

Concrete instances that pin the relay down: the theorems are not vacuously true
of the empty stream, and a relay that dropped a Close, rewrote a payload, or
injected a keepalive would fail them. -/

/-- A data frame with a given payload. -/
private def dataFrame (b : Bytes) : Frame :=
  { fin := true, opcode := .binary, payload := b }

/-- A Close frame (empty body — a bare Close). -/
private def closeFrame : Frame :=
  { fin := true, opcode := .close, payload := [] }

/-- Witness: two data frames then a Close then a trailing (post-Close) data frame.
The relay forwards the first two data frames and the Close verbatim, and drops the
trailing frame — Close propagated, relay halted, nothing rewritten, nothing
injected. -/
example :
    relayDir [dataFrame [1], dataFrame [2], closeFrame, dataFrame [3]]
      = [dataFrame [1], dataFrame [2], closeFrame] := by decide

/-- Witness: with no Close, all frames pass through in order — a genuinely
non-empty faithful relay. -/
example :
    relayDir [dataFrame [7], dataFrame [8], dataFrame [9]]
      = [dataFrame [7], dataFrame [8], dataFrame [9]] := by decide

/-- Witness: the trailing post-Close frame is genuinely absent from the output —
`ws_relay_no_inject`/`ws_relay_close` are not vacuous. -/
example : dataFrame [3] ∉ relayDir [closeFrame, dataFrame [3]] := by decide
