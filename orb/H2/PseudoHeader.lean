# HTTP/2 pseudo-header validation (RFC 9113 §8.3)

The HPACK decoder (`H2/Hpack.lean`) turns a HEADERS/CONTINUATION block into an
*ordered* list of decoded `(name, value)` byte-string pairs. RFC 9113 §8.3 then
imposes structural rules on that ordered list before it becomes a request. A
field block that breaks any of them is a **malformed request** (treated by the
peer as a stream error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`). The four rules this module
makes into theorems:

* **Ordering (§8.3).** All pseudo-header fields (names beginning with `:`) MUST
  appear before any regular header field. A pseudo-header after a regular field
  is malformed — `pseudo_before_regular`.
* **No duplicates (§8.3).** The same request pseudo-header name MUST NOT appear
  more than once. A second `:method` / `:path` / `:scheme` / `:authority` is
  malformed — `pseudo_no_duplicate`.
* **Required set (§8.3.1).** A well-formed request necessarily carries the
  `:method`, `:scheme`, and `:path` pseudo-headers — `pseudo_required`.
* **Unknown pseudo (§8.3).** A field whose name begins with `:` but is not one
  of the defined request pseudo-headers (e.g. `:status`, a *response*
  pseudo-header) is malformed — `pseudo_unknown_rejected`.

The validator is a single left-to-right scan over the decoded list, tracking a
five-flag `Seen` accumulator, followed by the required-set check. The four
headline theorems are *general* statements over arbitrary surrounding context
lists, proven by structural induction on the scan (no fixed-input tautologies).
A worked well-formed request (`goodRequest_ok`) and four mutant
counter-examples anchor non-vacuity on real byte strings.

Note on the witnesses: `strBytes s = s.toUTF8.toList` bottoms out in
`ByteArray`'s well-founded `toList` loop, which the kernel does not reduce, so
the concrete-byte witnesses are discharged by `native_decide` (compiler
evaluation). The four headline theorems use no such evaluation — they are
proven by induction and their axioms stay within
`{propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice}`.

Ground truth: `H2/Hpack.lean` (`strBytes`, `classifyName`, `PseudoKind`, the
decoded header list) and RFC 9113 §8.3 / §8.3.1.
