Admin.Cache — the proven invalidation decision behind `POST /admin/cache/purge`.

The admin purge drops cache entries so the next request for a purged key misses
(re-fetches from origin) instead of being served a stale body. The untrusted
shell (`crates/dataplane/src/cache.rs` → `ResponseCache::purge_all`) clears the
store; the DECISION that matters is that a purged key is thereafter a miss.

Reusing the proven RFC-9111 cache store (`Cache.Store`, whose `get?` is the
exact-key lookup the serve path hits on), this file states the purge as a store
transformer and proves:

  * `cache_purge_invalidates` — after purging a key, `get?` for that key is
    `none`: the next request is not served from cache;
  * `purgeAll_misses` — after a full purge, every key misses.

Non-vacuity: a concrete store that HITS a key is shown to MISS it after the
purge (`purge_turns_hit_to_miss`), and a no-op "purge" that leaves the store
untouched is proved to VIOLATE the invalidation contract — so the purge is
load-bearing, not decorative.

/-! ## The purge transformers -/

/-- **Full purge** (`POST /admin/cache/purge` with no key): drop every entry. -/
def purgeAll (s : Store) : Store := { s with entries := [] }

/-- **Keyed purge**: drop the entry(ies) for one exact cache key, keeping the
rest — the filter mirrors `Store.invalidate`'s drop-by-predicate shape. -/

/-- **Purge invalidates.** After purging a key, the proven exact-key lookup
(`Store.get?`, the lookup the serve path hits on) returns `none` for that key:

/-- **Non-vacuity.** The store genuinely HITS `k0` before the purge, and MISSES
it after — the purge turns a real hit into a miss, so
`cache_purge_invalidates` is not vacuous. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity via a mutant.** The no-op purge VIOLATES the invalidation
contract: on `s0`/`k0` the key still HITS, so an admin purge that fails to drop
the entry would keep serving the stale body — exactly the failure the real purge
forbids. -/
