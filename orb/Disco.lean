# DISCO: the NAT-traversal endpoint-probing FSM

A model of DISCO endpoint discovery — the peer-to-peer path probing a
node runs to find a working direct route to another node, before it will
send real traffic over that route instead of relaying. DISCO has no
public RFC; this is derived from the documented DISCO wire protocol,
whose two relevant messages are:

* **Ping** — carries an opaque, unguessable transaction id (TxID) and
  the sender's node key. A node emits Pings to each *candidate* direct
  endpoint (address) it has heard about for a peer.
* **Pong** — echoes the exact TxID of the Ping it answers, and reports
  the source address the responder observed. A Pong is accepted only if
  its TxID matches an outstanding Ping and it authenticates.

The probing discipline: a candidate endpoint starts `unprobed`; sending
a Ping moves it to `probed` with the outstanding TxID; a matching,
authentic Pong moves it to `verified`. Only a `verified` endpoint is
eligible for path selection, and the selected path is the lowest-latency
verified endpoint. A node never sends real traffic over an endpoint that
has not answered a probe — that is the anti-spoofing guarantee (an
attacker cannot get a bogus endpoint promoted without producing a Pong
echoing a TxID it could not have seen).

## Theorems

* `disco_no_promote_without_pong` — the central property: a path is put
  into use (a `usePath` output from selection) only for an endpoint that
  is already `verified` in the candidate table. Selection never promotes
  an unprobed or merely-probed endpoint.
* `disco_verified_needs_pong` — the only door into `verified`: if a step
  turns an endpoint from not-verified to verified, the step's input was
  a `recvPong` whose TxID matched that endpoint's outstanding probe and
  which authenticated. No other input can create a verified endpoint.
* `disco_verified_sticky` — a verified endpoint stays verified across a
  probe and across an unrelated pong (verification is monotone; loss of
  a path via timeout is a boundary, below).
* `disco_select_lowest` (supporting) — selection returns a verified
  member of the table.

## Boundary / UNCLOSED

* Cryptography — the NaCl box that seals and authenticates DISCO Ping
  and Pong messages — is the named uninterpreted boundary (`authPong`).
  The unguessability of the TxID (why a spoofed Pong cannot match an
  outstanding probe) is the security assumption behind that boundary.
* Endpoint *expiry* (a verified path going stale and being demoted after
  a heartbeat timeout) is not modeled; here verification is monotone.
* CallMeMaybe (the relayed rendezvous message that seeds candidate
  endpoints) and the STUN-derived reflexive-endpoint discovery are out
  of scope; candidates arrive abstractly via `addCandidate`.
* Latency is modeled as an abstract `Nat` used only for path ordering.

/-! ## Realized crypto — DISCO Pong authentication over the verified `crypto_box`

The abstract `Config.authPong` boundary is discharged here by the real NaCl
`crypto_box` (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305, verified `Crypto`). A DISCO packet is

    magic(6) ‖ senderDiscoPub(32) ‖ nonce(24) ‖ box

(the documented DISCO wire protocol), where the box seals the Pong body

    type(1) ‖ version(1) ‖ txid(12) ‖ srcAddr .

A Pong authenticates iff the box opens under the peer's disco key AND echoes the
outstanding, unguessable transaction id. `disco_crypto_promotion_genuine` then
composes this with the FSM's `disco_verified_needs_pong`: a path is verified only
by a *genuinely sealed* Pong — the anti-spoof, realized on real crypto. -/

/-! ## STUN reflexive-endpoint discovery (RFC 5389), feeding candidates

DISCO learns a node's *reflexive* endpoint — its public IP:port as seen through a
NAT — from a STUN Binding response's XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS (`Stun.decodeXorMapped`,
RFC 5389 §15.2), reusing the STUN codec. That reflexive address becomes a
*candidate* direct endpoint, entering the table `unprobed`: STUN seeds the
candidate, it does NOT authenticate a path — only a Pong does. -/

its address bytes and port into the opaque `addr` the FSM keys on). -/

/-! ## The real DISCO wire format

Everything above authenticates a Pong body *once it is opened*. This section makes
the whole DISCO frame spec-faithful to the public Tailscale `disco` package, so a
real Tailscale peer would accept and produce these exact bytes. A DISCO UDP frame
on the wire is

    Magic(6) ‖ senderDiscoPub(32) ‖ nonce(24) ‖ box

where `Magic = "TS💬"` (`0x54 53 f0 9f 92 ac`) and `box` is a NaCl `crypto_box`
(X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305) sealing the disco message

    type(1) ‖ version(1) ‖ body .

The three message types are Ping (`0x01`), Pong (`0x02`), CallMeMaybe (`0x03`):

  * **Ping**        — `txid(12) ‖ senderNodeKey(32)`
  * **Pong**        — `txid(12) ‖ srcIP(16) ‖ srcPort(2, big-endian)`
  * **CallMeMaybe** — `(ip(16) ‖ port(2))*` — the candidate endpoints to try.

The message version byte is `v0 = 0`. Parsing is deliberately lax on trailing
bytes (padding / future fields), exactly as the reference parser is. -/
