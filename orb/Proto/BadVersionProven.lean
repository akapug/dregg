# Proto.BadVersionProven — the DEPLOYED `505 HTTP Version Not Supported` rejection

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for the RFC 7230 §2.6 / §3.1 version gate. The deployed default serve
crosses `drorb_serve_metered_conformant` = `Reactor.ServeConformant.conformantServe`, whose
front gate is the proven `Reactor.Stage.RequestValidation.validationStage`. A request whose
HTTP version token is not `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/1.0` is short-circuited with
`badVersionResp` — status `505`, reason `HTTP Version Not Supported`.

Curl-confirmed against the deployed `dataplane` binary (io_uring, port 8097):

    $ printf 'GET /static/app.js HTTP/9.9\r\nHost: x\r\n\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8097
    HTTP/1.1 505 HTTP Version Not Supported       ← proven here (status + reason bytes)
    Connection: close                             ← the FINDING (see below)

    …

Theorems (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} — no `native_decide`,
no `Lean.ofReduceBool`):

  * `badversion_status_505` — the deployed refusal's status is `505`.
  * `badversion_reason_wire_bytes` — its reason phrase is exactly the 26 bytes of
    `"HTTP Version Not Supported"` (pinned via the `ba_toList_eq` bridge — pure-kernel
    `decide`), the phrase the wire's status line carries.
  * `badversion_no_headers` — the `505` response carries NO headers of its OWN.
  * `deployed_badversion_rejects` — a concrete `HTTP/9.9` request drives the DEPLOYED gate
    `validationStage.onRequest` to `.respond badVersionResp` (non-vacuous witness). This is
    the same `validationStage` the deployed `conformantServe` runs as its front gate, so the
    `505` on the wire IS this response, `+ Date` (the wrapper injects `Date` on the reject
    branch — see `Proto.DateHeaderProven` / `Reactor.ServeConformant.addDate`).

## The finding — `Connection: close` on the `505`, `keep-alive` on `400`/`501`

`badVersionResp.headers = []`, so the `Connection: close` on the wire is stamped NOT by the
Lean response but by the host keep-alive layer, which closes the connection ONLY on the
`505` (the version is unparseable, so the framing of any following request on the socket is
untrustworthy) while the `400 Bad Request` and `501 Not Implemented` refusals stay
`Connection: keep-alive` (curl-confirmed). The `505` rejection body itself is header-less;
the connection-close is a host framing decision layered on top.
