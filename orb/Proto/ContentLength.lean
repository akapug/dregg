# Content-Length body framing — proven exact, and no over-read

The deployed HTTP/1.1 dataplane frames a response body with a `Content-Length: N`
header and exactly `N` body bytes; the host reads that length to know where one
message ends and the next begins (`crates/dataplane/src/http.rs`, `body_frame`
→ `Fixed(n)`, `total = head_end + n`). This module proves the format the
serializer emits and the decoder that reads it are exact and self-delimiting.

The serializer `Reactor.serialize` (see `Reactor.Serialize`) emits, by
construction, `Content-Length: body.length` (the value is derived from the body,
never a caller input). This module adds the *reading* half a length-framed host
needs: a Content-Length-driven body decoder `decode`, the faithful model of the
Rust `next_request` framing — parse the head, read the `Content-Length` value,
take **exactly** that many body bytes, and leave the remainder (a pipelined next
message) untouched.

## What is proven

* `content_length_frames_exact` — a body of `N` bytes serialized and then decoded
  recovers exactly that body: for every well-formed response with no caller
  `Content-Length` header, and *any* trailing bytes `rest`,

      decode (serialize resp ++ rest) = some (wireForm resp, rest)

  The recovered `body` equals `resp.body` (via `wireForm`), the header carries
  `Content-Length: resp.body.length`, and the trailing `rest` is returned
  verbatim — the decoder consumed exactly the head plus `N` body bytes.
  `content_length_frames_exact_ok200` discharges the hypotheses on a concrete
  `200 OK`, witnessing non-vacuity.

* `content_length_no_overread` — whenever `decode` succeeds it read exactly the
  declared `Content-Length` and no further: the recovered body has length equal
  to the `Content-Length` header value, and the post-head bytes decompose as
  `body ++ rest` with `rest` (the next message) preserved byte-for-byte. The
  decoder never reads past `Content-Length`.
