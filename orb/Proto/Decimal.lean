# Decimal ASCII, and its inverse

The HTTP/1.1 response serializer renders numeric fields (the status code, the
derived `Content-Length`) as decimal ASCII via `Nat.repr … |>.toUTF8.toList`.
The response *client* has to read those bytes back. This module proves that a
plain left-to-right decimal fold inverts that rendering exactly:

    dval 0 (natToDec n) = n        (`dval_natToDec`)

and that every byte of `natToDec n` is an ASCII digit `0x30…0x39`
(`natToDec_isDigit`) — the two facts the response parser needs so the status
token and the `Content-Length` value are recovered faithfully and neither
carries a `SP`, `CR`, `LF`, or `:` delimiter.

The kernel obstacle is that `String.toUTF8`/`ByteArray.toList` do not reduce by
`decide` (they are `@[extern]`, and `ByteArray.toList` is a `get!` loop with no
library lemmas). `baMkList` proves the one loop-invariant that unblocks the
bridge from `natToDec` to the character list `Nat.toDigits 10 n`.

Everything here is Lean-core only; total; no `sorry`.
