# Proto.RateDeployedProven — the DEPLOYED rate-limit `429` SERVED end-to-end (ledger mw.6)

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for the deployed token-bucket refusal. `Reactor.Stage.Rate.rateStage` (a
genuinely low burst limit, `rateCap = 8`) is WIRED into the deployed HTTP/1.1 metered fold
`Reactor.Deploy.deployStagesFull2` (stage 4), and the running dataplane threads the
per-connection request sequence into that fold via `Reactor.Deploy.servePipelineFull2Metered`
(the `drorb_serve_metered` ABI, `seq` under the `rate-seq` attr). A connection that has
already served `rateCap` requests has an empty bucket, so the REAL `Rate.tryAdmit` rejects
and the gate answers `429`.

The PRIOR deployed evidence (`RetryAfterProven`) was only MEMBERSHIP (`rateStage ∈
deployStagesFull2`) + the refusal SHAPE (`resp429.status = 429`). This file closes the honest
gap: the ASSEMBLED fourteen-stage fold — every prefix gate (`jwtAdminStage`, `basicStage`,
`ipfilterStage`) genuinely PASSING — BUILDS status `429` for an over-limit connection,
through the whole status-stable response onion. Same bar the JWT gate already met
(`Reactor.Deploy.servePipelineFull2_admin_status_401`).

The CURL that anchors this file — a burst of `> rateCap` requests on ONE keep-alive
connection to the running dataplane; the first `rateCap` answer `200`, the rest `429`:

    $ ( for i in $(seq 1 12); do printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: x\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n'; done ) \
        | nc 127.0.0.1 8099 | grep -c '429 Too Many Requests'

Theorems (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}):
  * `deployed_rate_429` — parametric: for ANY ctx whose request is neither `/admin` nor
    `/private` (the JWT + Basic gates pass), whose client is admitted (the IP-filter gate
    passes), and whose reconstructed bucket is over the limit, the built deployStagesFull2
    response has status `429`.
  * `throttled_serves_429` — the concrete non-vacuous witness: a real `GET /` from an
    admitted loopback peer whose connection has already served `rateCap` requests is SERVED
    `429` through the whole deployed fold.
  * `metered_rate_429` — tied to the deployed metered serve FUNCTION: supplying an admitted
    peer and a per-connection sequence of `rateCap` (the `rate-seq` attr the accept path
    stashes) builds the `429`, for any request bytes parsing to a non-admin/non-private
    target.
