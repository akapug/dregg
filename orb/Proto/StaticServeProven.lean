# Proto.StaticServeProven — the plain `200 OK` static serve on the DEPLOYED handler

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for the deployed plain `GET /static/app.js` (no conditional / range
headers). The deployed default app (`Reactor.App.demoApp`) routes `/static` to the
`staticFile` handler, and `Reactor.App.responseOfReq req .staticFile` is DEFINITIONALLY
`StaticFile.serveDeployed (targetSegments req.target) req.headers`
(`Proto.EtagProven.deployed_staticFile_route`, `rfl`). With an EMPTY header list the
deployed header parser (`reqOfHeaders []`) short-circuits — `List.find?` over `[]` never
runs `String.splitOn` — so `serveDeployed assetSegs []` renders the FULL `200` in the
pure kernel, and these theorems describe the exact `200` the running dataplane emits.

The CURL that anchors this file (against the running `dataplane` serve):

    $ curl -s -D - http://127.0.0.1:8099/static/app.js
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    …
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Content-Type: application/javascript
    Content-Length: 35

    console.log('drorb static asset');

Theorems (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} — no `native_decide`,
no `Lean.ofReduceBool`):
  * `deployed_static_200` — the deployed handler answers a bare `GET /static/app.js`
    with `200`, a body of exactly the 35 octets the curl carries, and the
    `Content-Type: application/javascript` + `Accept-Ranges: bytes` headers.
  * `plain_body_bytes` — those 35 body octets ARE `console.log('drorb static asset');\n`
    — octet-for-octet the curl body (`ba_toList_eq` bridge; non-vacuous).
  * `deployed_static_route` — tied to the running `staticFile` route: any request whose
    normalized target is `/static/app.js` with no headers gets exactly this `200` body.
