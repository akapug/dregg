# Proto.RedirectProven — the DEPLOYED `Location:` redirect (ledger row `h1.redirect`)

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for `Location`/3xx redirect. The redirect gate
`Reactor.Stage.Redirect.redirectStage` is WIRED into the deployed HTTP/1.1 fold
`Reactor.Deploy.deployStagesFull2` (it is element #5), so a request whose target
matches the configured rule (`/old`) short-circuits the whole pipeline with a
`308 Moved` carrying a `Location` header rendered by the REAL `Redirect.redirect`
library (RFC 9110 §15.4).

## Ground truth — curl against the running dataplane (io_uring, port 8080)

```
$ curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/old
HTTP/1.1 308 Moved
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://new.example/old
Server: drorb
Content-Length: 0
```

The status is `308`, the `Location` value is `https://new.example` prepended to
the request's decoded path (`/old`), and the body is empty (`Content-Length: 0`)
— exactly what the theorems below fix.

## What is proven here (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound})

* `redirect_deployed` — `redirectStage` really is in `deployStagesFull2` (the
  redirect logic is on the default request path, not a side model).
* `location_name_bytes` — the emitted header name is exactly the ASCII bytes of
  `"Location"` (the `.toUTF8.toList` constant kernel-reduced via `ba_toList_eq`).
* `ruleTarget_bytes` — the configured redirect target is exactly the bytes of
  `"/old"` (the curl's path).
* `redirect_status_308` — for ANY request the gate's response status is `308`.
* `redirect_location_prefix` — the rendered `Location` string is
  `"https://new.example" ++ <decoded path>`; for `/old` this is the wire's
  `https://new.example/old`.
* `redirect_response_shape` — the built redirect `Response` carries a single
  header whose name is `locationName` and whose value is the rendered location
  bytes, with an empty body (the `Content-Length: 0` on the wire).
* `redirect_gate_fires` — for the concrete `/old` request the gate short-circuits
  (handler + later stages skipped), riding the real `redirectStage_gate`.

The `Location` VALUE's exact bytes cross the extern `String.fromUTF8!`/`toUTF8`
boundary (the request path is decoded with `String.fromUTF8!`); its concrete
octets are established by the curl. The IN-kernel facts are the header NAME
bytes, the status, the response shape, and the render structure.

/-- Kernel-reducibility bridge for `toUTF8`-derived byte lists (the same bridge
proved in `Proto.GzipProven`). `ByteArray.toList` is defined by well-founded
recursion, so `"…".toUTF8.toList` is opaque to `decide`/`rfl`; this rewrites it to
the structural `bs.data.toList`, which the kernel DOES reduce — so concrete byte
witnesses close by `decide` in the pure kernel ({propext, Quot.sound}; no

is `308` — the wire's `HTTP/1.1 308`. The status is the configured code's status

exactly `"https://new.example"` prepended to the decoded request path. Rendering
is independent of the query argument (the template has no `{query}` token). For
