# Proto.ContentLanguageProven — the DEPLOYED `200` carries NO `Content-Language` (no negotiation)

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for content negotiation. The deployed static handler answers a `200 (OK)`
for `/static/app.js` with EXACTLY three representation headers — `ETag`, `Accept-Ranges`,
`Content-Type` — and no others of its own. In particular there is NO `Content-Language`
field: the running serve implements no proactive language negotiation (RFC 9110 §12.5.4 /
§8.5), so it never advertises the representation's language, and no deployed stage emits a
`Content-Language`. This is an honest not-deployed finding, same class as
`Proto.OptionsProven` — the header a naive ledger might credit is simply not on the wire.

## Ground truth — curl against the running dataplane (io_uring, port 8097)

```
$ curl -s -D - -o /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:8097/static/app.js
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "9e983f35"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Type: application/javascript
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
Server: drorb
x-upstream: …
Content-Length: 35
```

No `Content-Language` field anywhere on the wire.

## What is proven here (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound})

  * `deployed_staticFile_route` — the deployed `/static` route IS `serveDeployed` (`rfl`).
  * `ok_header_names` — the `200 (.ok)` arm's header NAMES are exactly
    `[ETag, Accept-Ranges, Content-Type]` — a closed three-element set (`rfl`).
  * `no_content_language_ok` — for ANY body/etag AND ANY value `v`, `(Content-Language, v)`
    is absent from the `200` header list: the representation-language advisory is never
    emitted by the deployed handler, independent of the file served.
  * `plain_get_status_200` / `plain_get_omits_content_language` — the concrete deployed
    `GET /static/app.js` is answered `200` and its headers omit `Content-Language`
    (non-vacuous: exhibits a real request that hits the branch — the curl above).
  * `content_language_wire_bytes` — the exact bytes of the `"Content-Language"` name that
    is ABSENT (pinned via `ba_toList_eq`, pure-kernel `decide`; no `native_decide`).

## Not proven in-kernel (deliberately)

That NO later deployed stage (SecurityHeaders / header rewrite / …) adds a
`Content-Language` on the response phase is established EMPIRICALLY by the curl above,
re-run by the verifier. The finding does not hinge on it: the handler's `200` originates
without the field, and the wire confirms none is added.
