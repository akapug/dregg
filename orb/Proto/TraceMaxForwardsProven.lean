# Proto.TraceMaxForwardsProven — the DEPLOYED serve is TRACE-blind (an honest RFC gap)

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for two related RFC 7231 method behaviors the deployed serve does NOT
implement — same class of honest finding as `Proto.OptionsProven` / `Proto.RetryAfterProven`.

`TRACE` is one of the recognized methods in the deployed front gate
`Reactor.Stage.RequestValidation.knownMethods`, so a `TRACE` request is NOT rejected `501`
(unlike an unknown method) — it clears the gate and is served by the inner serve keyed on
its request-TARGET, exactly as the same-target `GET` is. But RFC 7231 §4.3.8 says a `TRACE`
response SHOULD reflect the received request in a `message/http` body, and §5.1.2 says an
intermediary MUST act on `Max-Forwards`. The deployed serve does NEITHER: it answers a
`TRACE` with the ordinary target response and ignores `Max-Forwards` entirely.

Curl-confirmed against the deployed `dataplane` binary (io_uring, port 8097):

    $ printf 'TRACE /static/app.js HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: x\r\nMax-Forwards: 0\r\n\r\n' \
        | nc 127.0.0.1 8097
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK                               ← served as GET, NOT a TRACE echo
    …
    Content-Type: application/javascript
    Content-Length: 35                            ← the app.js body, not the echoed request

The `TRACE` is answered `200` with the SAME 35-byte `app.js` body a `GET
/static/app.js` returns — `Max-Forwards: 0` changes nothing. No echo, no decrement.

Theorems (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} — no `native_decide`,
no `Lean.ofReduceBool`):

  * `trace_is_known_method` — `TRACE ∈ knownMethods`: the gate recognizes it (so no `501`).
  * `trace_method_wire_bytes` — the method token is exactly the 5 bytes of `"TRACE"`.
  * `deployed_trace_not_rejected` — the DEPLOYED gate `.continue`s a real `TRACE` request
    (version/method/Host all clear), so it is served, not refused — method-BLIND: the same
    request as `GET` bar the method reaches the identical inner serve.
  * `trace_get_gate_agnostic` — `TRACE` and `GET` are BOTH recognized yet distinct tokens:
    the gate treats them identically, which is exactly why the serve is method-blind.
  * `max_forwards_name_wire_bytes` — the exact bytes of the `"Max-Forwards"` request-header
    field the deployed serve IGNORES (pinned via `ba_toList_eq`, pure-kernel `decide`).

## Not proven in-kernel (deliberately, per the honest-gap posture)

That NO deployed stage reads/decrements `Max-Forwards` or echoes the request is established
EMPIRICALLY by the curl above (a `TRACE … Max-Forwards: 0` returns the ordinary `200`
body), not by reducing the whole pipeline in-kernel. The in-kernel facts pin WHY: `TRACE`
is a recognized method (so it is served, not `501`ed) and the gate is method-agnostic past
the recognized set.
