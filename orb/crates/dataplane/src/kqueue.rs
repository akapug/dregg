//! The macOS / BSD IO path: a per-core kqueue completion-queue reactor.
//!
//! This is the preferred IO path on macOS and the BSDs, the sibling of the Linux
//! `io_uring` loop (`uring`). It replaces the thread-per-connection blocking model
//! with a small number of **shards** — one single-threaded event loop per core —
//! each driving its own `kqueue` over its own connection set. Like the io_uring
//! shards this is the share-nothing reactor model: no connection state, buffer, or
//! slab is shared between shards.
//!
//! ## Accept distribution across shards
//!
//! Each shard binds its own listener with `SO_REUSEPORT` (`SO_REUSEADDR` too), the
//! kernel-load-balancing primitive on Linux and FreeBSD (`SO_REUSEPORT_LB`).
//! Darwin's `SO_REUSEPORT`, however, only *permits* the duplicate binds — it does
//! not hash-distribute connections, delivering every accept to a single socket. So
//! the reactor does not rely on the kernel to pick a shard: every shard registers
//! *all* the shards' listeners on its own kqueue, level-triggered, and the shards
//! race `accept()`. Whichever listener the kernel queues a connection on, all the
//! shards see it and one wins the accept — a portable per-shard load balancer that
//! distributes on Darwin and the BSDs alike, and composes with `SO_REUSEPORT`
//! hashing where the kernel provides it. A small per-turn accept batch keeps one
//! shard from draining a whole burst before its siblings get a turn.
//!
//! ## Readiness turned into completions
//!
//! `kqueue` is a *readiness* interface, not a completion one: it reports that an
//! fd can be read or written, not that bytes have moved. This reactor presents the
//! same **completion** surface the io_uring shards do by doing the I/O inline at
//! the point readiness is known:
//!
//!   - **Inline fast path.** `want_read` / `want_write` attempt the `recv` / `send`
//!     syscall immediately (`MSG_DONTWAIT`). On success the bytes are in hand and
//!     the request is framed / the response advanced synchronously — the kqueue is
//!     never touched. Only on `EAGAIN` is the corresponding filter (`EVFILT_READ`
//!     for recv, `EVFILT_WRITE` for send) registered `EV_ADD|EV_CLEAR`, deferring
//!     the work to the next readiness edge.
//!   - **One kevent per turn.** The poll makes a single `kevent` call that both
//!     flushes the batched registration changelist and waits for the next edges;
//!     each ready fd then does its inline I/O and produces its completion. The work
//!     per turn is `O(ready)`, not `O(registered)`.
//!   - **Adaptive backoff.** A saturated socket that returns `EAGAIN` in a streak
//!     would burn one syscall per optimistic inline attempt; after a streak the
//!     reactor skips the next `2^streak` inline attempts (capped) for that
//!     direction and waits on the filter instead, resetting on the first success.
//!
//! ## The one shared resource, and where the ceiling is
//!
//! Exactly as with the io_uring shards: the proven core is a pure
//! `ByteArray -> ByteArray` transform, so a shard needs no shared mutable engine
//! state to run it, but the Lean runtime is a process-global singleton. Every
//! shard funnels its framed requests to the one runtime-owner thread over the
//! serve gateway and is woken with the response through its own self-pipe. The IO
//! fabric scales across shard cores; the serve transform does not, so the
//! steady-state ceiling is `1 / (serve latency)` however many shards feed it.
//!
//! ## Confinement
//!
//! A shard's reactor, its slab, and every buffer live and die on the one shard
//! thread; nothing here is `Sync`. The single cross-thread entry is [`wake`],
//! called by the runtime-owner thread when a response is waiting in a shard's
//! mailbox — it writes one byte to that shard's self-pipe, whose read end is
//! registered on the kqueue, breaking the `kevent` wait.
