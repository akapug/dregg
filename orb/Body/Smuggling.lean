# Request-smuggling defense: message-body framing (RFC 9112 §6.1–§6.3)

An HTTP/1.1 message body is framed by exactly one of two mechanisms: a
`Content-Length` (a fixed octet count) or a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (a
self-delimiting chunk stream). Request smuggling exploits the *ambiguity* that
arises when a message carries framing signals a downstream pair of servers
resolve differently:

* **CL.TE** — the front server frames on `Content-Length`, the back server on
  the chunked stream. Body bytes the front server treats as payload the back
  server reads as a *second request*.
* **TE.CL** — the reverse split.
* **dup-CL** — two `Content-Length` values; one server believes the first, the
  other the second, and the octets in between smuggle a request.
* **bad-chunk** — a malformed chunk-size that one parser rejects and another
  silently truncates, leaving a smuggled tail.

RFC 9112 §6.1 resolves the CL/TE overlap by giving `Transfer-Encoding`
precedence (a sender that emits both is broken and MAY be treated as an error);
§6.3 requires rejecting a message whose framing is undeterminable. This file
takes the strict, non-ambiguous stance: **a message carrying both framings, or
conflicting `Content-Length` values, or a malformed chunk, is rejected** — there
is then a *single* interpretation (rejection) that no two servers can split, so
no octet is ever reinterpreted as a smuggled request.

The framing decision is factored as two independent classifiers over the parsed
header list — `clStatus` (the `Content-Length` picture) and `teStatus` (the
`Transfer-Encoding` picture) — combined by `decideOn`. The security theorems
reason about `decideOn` and hold for *every* request; concrete CL.TE / TE.CL /
dup-CL / bad-chunk attack vectors are then discharged against them, witnessing
the hypotheses are inhabited (non-vacuous) and that real smuggling attempts land
in the rejecting branch.

Headline theorems:

* `no_desync` — a request whose headers frame *both* a `Content-Length` and a
  `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is **never** framed as a `Content-Length` body:
  the decision is a rejection. So the chunked tail can never be handed on as a
  smuggled second request (`decide` is never `.length _`; it is `.reject _`).
* `reject_dup_cl` — two differing `Content-Length` values are rejected, not
  silently reconciled.
* `reject_bad_chunk` — a chunked body whose chunk-size token is malformed is
  rejected (`decodeStream = .error`), never silently truncated to a short
  `.complete` body that leaves a smuggled tail.

The `naive_would_smuggle` theorem exhibits the *mutant*: a length-only framer
that ignores `Transfer-Encoding` frames the CL.TE vector as a 6-byte body — the
exact desync `no_desync` forbids.

`Content-Length` and a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, the body is **never** framed
as a fixed-length body: the decision is a rejection. A CL.TE / TE.CL split is
therefore impossible — there is no length interpretation for one server to take
while another follows the chunk stream, so the chunked tail is never handed on as
a smuggled request. -/
