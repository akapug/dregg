# Request-framing faithfulness — the boundary is machine-checked, not trusted

`Body/Smuggling.lean` proves the framing *decision* is smuggling-safe: a
`Content-Length` that conflicts with a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, a duplicate
`Content-Length`, or a malformed chunk is **rejected**, never resolved to a
fixed-length body that a downstream peer would split (`no_desync`,
`reject_dup_cl`, `reject_bad_chunk`). That fixes *which framing* is chosen.

This file adds the piece the decision alone does not give: the request
**boundary** — *where the request ends and the next one begins* — and proves it
faithful. The trusted Rust `next_request` (`crates/dataplane/src/http.rs`) scans
an accumulation buffer, finds the head/body split (`CRLFCRLF`), frames the body
(`Content-Length` / chunked), and reports `Frame::Complete(total)`; the host then
hands `buf[..total]` to the proven serve and drains it, keeping `buf[total..]` as
the next (pipelined) request. A framing bug there is a request-smuggling desync
in the trusted surface. Here that boundary computation is modelled and proven:

* `framing_faithful` — a fixed-length (`Content-Length`) framing consumes
  **exactly** `head ++ body`, where the body is the head-declared `n` octets, and
  the remainder is the next request **verbatim**: no octet of the body leaks past
  the boundary and no octet of the next request is swallowed. The boundary is a
  function of the *head* alone (`headEnd + n`), never of body content, so no
  attacker-supplied body byte can shift it.
* `framing_faithful_empty` — the same for a request with no body: the boundary is
  the head end; the whole remainder is the next request verbatim.
* `framing_faithful_chunked` — a chunked framing consumes `head ++ chunked-section`
  and leaves the remainder verbatim, with the chunked section's length taken from
  the proven `Chunked.decodeStream`.
* `frame_bounded` — a `complete` boundary never runs past the buffer (no
  overread): `consumed ≤ buf.length`.
* `frame_no_smuggle` — a `Content-Length` present **together with** a chunked
  `Transfer-Encoding` is framed `reject`, **never** `complete` — so the framer
  never consumes only the `Content-Length` octets while leaving the chunked tail
  as a smuggled second request. This is the boundary-level statement of
  `Body.Smuggling.no_desync`.

The smuggling surface is the CL-vs-chunked *body-length* decision; `frameFixed`
takes that decision from `Body.Smuggling.decide` (the proven-safe classifier), so
the boundary it computes inherits the smuggling safety. Non-vacuity is witnessed
against the concrete `clteVector` (`Content-Length: 6` + `Transfer-Encoding:
chunked`): the proven framer rejects it, and a naive length-only framer would
have consumed 6 body octets and admitted the smuggled tail.

`head` the header block (length `headEnd`) and `body` exactly `n` octets, the
framer reports `complete (headEnd + n)`, and that boundary splits the buffer
*exactly*:

* the consumed prefix is `head ++ body` — the head plus precisely the declared
  `n` body octets, nothing more, nothing less;
* the remainder is `rest` — the next request **verbatim**, with no octet of this
  body leaking into it and no octet of it swallowed by this body.

The boundary `headEnd + n` is a function of the *head* alone, so no attacker
choice of `body`/`rest` content can shift it. -/

/-- The CL.TE vector (`Content-Length: 6` + `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`) is

long enough to hold the `Content-Length` body, the naive framer computes a

framer refuses (`clte_frame_rejected`). The two disagree, so the contract is not
