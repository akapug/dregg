/-
Client.CookieJar — the full RFC 6265 client cookie STORE, layered on the
sendability matcher of `Client.Session` (§5.1.3 / §5.1.4 / §5.4) and the expiry /
eviction policy of `Client.CookieExpiry` (§5.2 / §5.3). Those two modules proved,
respectively, WHICH stored cookies a request may see and WHEN a stored cookie
stops being sent / HOW the jar stays bounded. What a real client still needs — and
what this module adds — is the STORE side of §5.3: the `Set-Cookie` intake path,
the round-trip guarantee that a cookie you store is a cookie you get back, and the
one storage rule that is a pure security guard rather than an accounting rule:

  * §5.3 step 5, the **public-suffix / "supercookie" rejection**: a `Domain`
    cookie whose domain-attribute is a public suffix (`com`, `co.uk`, …) is
    rejected outright, so no origin can plant a cookie that every site under a
    registry would then send. This is the rule that stops cross-site supercookies;
    it has no analogue in the matcher (a supercookie domain-MATCHES everything —
    the whole point is to never let it into the store in the first place).

The Public Suffix List is external, mutable data (not a mathematical object and
not crypto), so it is modelled as an OPAQUE oracle: the jar carries a predicate
`psl : Labels → Bool` and every theorem is universally quantified over it. The
decision LOGIC around the oracle — accept iff host-only or not-a-public-suffix,
and the fact that this logic keeps supercookies out — is what is proven; the
oracle's contents are never invented.

`Client.Session` and `Client.CookieExpiry` are imported UNMODIFIED: the real
`Cookie`, `Req`, `cookieMatches`, `StoredCookie`, `resolveExpiry`, `reap`,
`enforce`, and the expiry-aware `jarSend` are reused, so the store composes with
the genuine matcher and expiry gate rather than a stand-in.

## The jar

A `Jar` is a public-suffix oracle, a pair of storage caps, and the stored
cookies. `store` is the `Set-Cookie` intake: it resolves the wire expiry against
the clock, applies the public-suffix guard, and (if accepted) inserts the cookie
newest-first. `get` is the outgoing selection at a clock instant: the expiry-aware
`jarSend`, which drops expired cookies and returns only the live matches. `enforced`
is the §5.3 storage-limit GC, reusing the proven `enforce`.

  * `jar_store_get` — a `Set-Cookie` that is accepted, live at `now`, and matches
    the request is retrieved by `get` (store→get round-trip; the matcher's
    domain/path/Secure conditions are exactly what `cookieMatches` decides).
  * `jar_evicts_expired` — a cookie expired at `now` is NEVER returned by `get`,
    for any request (the expiry gate dominates the matcher).
  * `jar_public_suffix` — a `Domain` cookie for a public-suffix domain is rejected:
    `store` leaves the jar unchanged, so `get` can never yield it. No supercookie.
  * `jar_size_bounded` — after `enforced` the jar holds at most `total` cookies and
    at most `perDomain` for any single domain.

Each theorem is accompanied by a concrete witness and, where a guard is the point
(the public-suffix rule, the expiry gate), a mutant that drops the guard and
thereby admits the attack — so none of the theorems are vacuous.

assumed, only its type. -/

rejected. -/

-- Domain-scoped (host-only cookies are immune by construction), per §5.3 step 5.

-- The mutant admits the supercookie and would then SEND it to sub.example.com
-- (and, being a `com` cookie, to every registrant under `com`) — exactly the
-- cross-site supercookie the real guard prevents. So the guard has teeth.
