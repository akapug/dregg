Client.CookieExpiry — verified cookie EXPIRY and jar-eviction policy, layered on
top of the RFC 6265 §5.4 sendability matcher in `Client.Session`.

`Client.Session` proved WHICH stored cookies a request may see (domain / path /
Secure matching). This module adds the two remaining halves of the RFC 6265 §5.3
storage model that a real client needs and that a matcher alone does not give:

  * WHEN a stored cookie stops being sent — its persistence lifetime, computed
    from the `Max-Age` (§5.2.2) and `Expires` (§5.2.1) attributes and checked
    against the clock at send time (§5.4 step 1: expired cookies are removed and
    never returned).
  * HOW the jar stays bounded — the §5.3 storage limits: a per-domain cookie cap
    and a global cap, both enforced by evicting the OLDEST cookies first.

Each capability is specified as an INDEPENDENT contract, in this module's own
vocabulary, with no appeal to the executable decision functions; the executable
functions are proven to meet it, and a mutant / concrete witness is exhibited so
the theorems are not vacuous. The `Client.Session` module is imported UNMODIFIED
— the real `Cookie`, `Req`, and `cookieMatches` matcher are reused, so the
expiry gate composes with the genuine matcher rather than a stand-in.

## Expiry (RFC 6265 §5.2.1 / §5.2.2 / §5.3)

A stored cookie carries a resolved expiry INSTANT (`none` for a session cookie,
which has no persistent lifetime and never time-expires). `resolveExpiry` turns
the wire attribute into that instant: an absolute `Expires` time is taken as-is;
a `Max-Age` of `Δ` seconds resolves to `now + Δ`, and — per §5.2.2 — a `Max-Age`
of zero or less resolves to the earliest representable instant, i.e. the cookie
is already expired. A stored cookie is expired at `now` iff it has an expiry
instant `e` with `e ≤ now`.

  * `cookie_expired_not_sent` — a cookie that is expired at `now` is NEVER in the
    outgoing set, regardless of how perfectly it domain/path/Secure-matches. The
    time gate dominates the matcher.

## Jar eviction (RFC 6265 §5.3 step 1 + steps 11–12)

  * `jar_evicts_expired` — the reaper's surviving set is EXACTLY the cookies that
    are not expired at `now`: every expired cookie is dropped and every fresh one
    is kept (both directions).
  * `jar_size_bounded` — after enforcement the jar holds at most `total` cookies,
    and at most `perDomain` cookies for any single domain. Enforcement admits
    cookies greedily in NEWEST-FIRST order and rejects once a cap is hit, so the
    cookies it drops are the OLDEST; `enforce_keeps_newest` pins this down: when
    the per-domain cap does not bind first, the survivors are precisely the
    `total` newest cookies (the older tail is evicted).
