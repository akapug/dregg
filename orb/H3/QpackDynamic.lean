H3 QPACK dynamic table — the LEDGER h3.qpackdyn lane (RFC 9204 §2.1.2, §3.2, §4.5).

This is a breadth leaf library: it proves the three RFC-conformant properties of
the QPACK dynamic table that a decoder must uphold, over the DEPLOYED definitions
of `H3/Qpack.lean` (`DynTable`, `DynTable.add`, `keepFit`, the index resolutions,
and the deployed `decodeFieldSection`). No new executable — the theorems bind
directly to the code the deployed QUIC/H3 lane runs.

Three headline theorems (each with real, non-vacuous hypotheses):

* `qpack_dynamic_insert` (§3.2.2, §3.2.4) — inserting a fitting entry makes it the
  NEWEST entry, advances the insert count, keeps the table within its maximum, and
  when the new entry cannot coexist with everything already stored, eviction removes
  STRICTLY the OLDEST entries (the survivors are a proper prefix, strictly fewer).

* `qpack_dynamic_ref` (§3.2.5 / §4.5.2) — a field line that REFERENCES a dynamic
  entry decodes to EXACTLY that entry. Run the deployed `decodeFieldSection` on the
  wire bytes `02 00 80` (Required Insert Count 1 → Base 1, then an indexed dynamic
  field line at relative index 0) against the table AFTER inserting `(n, v)`: the
  decode accepts and the emitted field resolves byte-for-byte to `(n, v)`.

* `qpack_blocked_stream` (§2.1.2) — a reference to a not-yet-received insert BLOCKS:
  the IDENTICAL wire `02 00 80` decoded against the table BEFORE the insert is
  applied (`insertCount = 0`, so the reconstructed Required Insert Count 1 exceeds
  the inserts received) is rejected with `Err.dynamicUnsupported` — no decode of an
  unavailable entry. `qpack_blocked_then_acked` pairs the two: the same bytes block
  before the insert and decode to the entry after it.

The `HuffmanDecoder` is the abstract oracle (RFC 7541 Appendix B code the client
emits); every theorem here holds uniformly over every decoder behavior — none of
these vectors sets the Huffman bit, so the oracle is never consulted, and no crypto
is invoked. Zero sorries; `#print axioms` is the sacred subset
{propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice}.

/-- **`qpack_dynamic_insert` (RFC 9204 §3.2.2, §3.2.4).** Inserting a fitting
`(n, v)` (`entrySize (n, v) ≤ maxSize`) makes it the NEWEST entry (list head),
advances the insert count by one, and keeps the table within its maximum size.
When the new entry additionally cannot coexist with everything already stored
(`maxSize < entrySize (n, v) + tableSize entries`), the insert evicts STRICTLY the
OLDEST entries: the survivors are a proper PREFIX of the pre-insert table (strictly
fewer). The `hs` hypothesis is load-bearing — an oversize insert stores nothing
(`add` returns the empty table), so `head?` would be `none`. -/

regular field `⟨ne, ve⟩`, and the decoded field RESOLVES to EXACTLY the inserted
entry: `ne → n`, `ve → v`, byte for byte. Holds for every Huffman-decoder behavior
