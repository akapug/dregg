# Control.Dns — MagicDNS server-side record generation

The coordination server does not just *resolve* MagicDNS names; it first
*builds* the `DnsConfig` it distributes in each node's netmap. This module models
that fan-out: given the search domains and the authorized peer set, the server
emits one MagicDNS record per peer that has both a name and an overlay address,
mapping `name ↦ first overlay address`.

This is the producer side of the MagicDNS seam `Control` fixes: `Control` gives
`DnsConfig.resolve` and its soundness (`dns_resolve_sound`); here we give
`buildDns`, the function whose output that resolver runs over. The headline
property composes the two: a name that resolves in a built config resolves to a
genuine peer's record — the server never synthesizes a name→address mapping that
no authorized peer justifies.

Faithful to headscale's MagicDNS: each node's fully-qualified name answers to
that node's overlay (Tailscale) address, and the record set the server hands out
is exactly the current authorized peers, nothing else.

/-- The MagicDNS record a single node contributes, if any.

A node earns a record only when it has *both* a MagicDNS `name` (non-empty
FQDN bytes) *and* at least one assigned overlay address. When both hold, the
record is `name ↦ (first address's bytes)` — the node's primary overlay
address, matching how MagicDNS answers a node's name with its Tailscale IP. A
node missing either half contributes nothing (`none`), so nameless or
address-less nodes never appear in the distributed DNS. -/
def nodeRecord (n : Node) : Option (Bytes × Bytes) :=
  match n.name, n.addresses with
  | [], _ => none
  | _, [] => none
  | name@(_ :: _), a :: _ => some (name, a.addr)

/-- Build the `DnsConfig` the coordination server distributes in the netmap: the
given search `domains`, and one MagicDNS record per peer that has a name and an
address (`filterMap nodeRecord` over the authorized peer set). This is what the
server places in `ControlState.dns` / `NetMap.dns`. -/
def buildDns (domains : List Bytes) (peers : List Node) : DnsConfig :=
  { domains := domains, records := peers.filterMap nodeRecord }

/-- **Records are peer-derived.** Every record in a built config comes from some
peer in the input set via `nodeRecord` — the server synthesizes no name→address
mapping of its own. -/
theorem dns_record_from_peer (domains : List Bytes) (peers : List Node)
    (name addr : Bytes) (h : (name, addr) ∈ (buildDns domains peers).records) :

  simp only [buildDns] at h
  rw [List.mem_filterMap] at h
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hrec⟩ := h
  exact ⟨p, hp, hrec⟩

/-- **MagicDNS resolution is peer-sound (headline).** If a name resolves to an
address in a config the server built, that mapping is justified by an actual
peer: some peer in the set has `nodeRecord p = some (name, addr)`. Composes this
module's `dns_record_from_peer` with the foundation's `dns_resolve_sound`, so a
resolved answer is never a fabricated name→address pair. -/

  dns_record_from_peer domains peers name addr
    (dns_resolve_sound (buildDns domains peers) name addr h)

/-- **Search domains pass through untouched.** The built config's domains are
exactly the ones handed in — the fan-out touches only the record set. -/

domains and an empty record set. -/
