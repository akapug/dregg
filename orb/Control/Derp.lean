# DERP relay-map distribution

The coordination server hands each node a **DERP map**: a set of relay regions
that form the encrypted-relay fallback path when a direct connection cannot be
established. Each node advertises a *home* region (`Node.derp`), and that home
must name a region that actually appears in the distributed map — otherwise the
node's fallback path points at a relay region that does not exist.

This module models that fan-out and proves the key soundness property: in a
valid distribution every node (self and every peer) has a home region that is a
real member of the map. This mirrors the coordination server's registry lookup
(`Control.lookupReg`) with a first-match region lookup.

This is `Control.Derp`, the DERP-map *distribution* component. It is unrelated
to the top-level `Derp` module (the DERP wire-frame protocol).
