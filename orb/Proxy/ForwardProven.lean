# Proxy.ForwardProven — the DEPLOYED reverse-proxy forward, proven end-to-end

This is the PROVE-WHAT-RUNS seam for the reverse-proxy forward the running
dataplane executes on the `--io uring` path. Two facts, both over the code the
engine actually runs:

* **`proxy_backend_pick`** — the fleet backend pick is *governed by the live
  mask*. The deployed step (`Reactor.ServeStep.serveStep`) chooses the upstream
  with the proven `Reactor.ProxyDial.pick`, a pure function of the health/breaker
  `mask` and the sticky affinity `key`. A backend is picked ONLY when its mask bit
  is set — so a probe-down / breaker-open backend is never dialled — and the pick
  is single-valued (deterministic) in `(mask, key)`.

* **`proxy_forwards_faithful`** — a proxied request reaches EXACTLY that picked
  backend, and the reply is relayed through the proven response transform. The
  deployed step `.yield`s a `proxyDial` to the id the pick chose (never a
  host-side re-pick), and resuming with the upstream reply produces
  `Reactor.ServeStep.proxyRespTransform input upstream` — the reply parsed and run
  through the cors / gzip / security-headers / header fold and re-serialized. The
  relayed response therefore carries the added transform headers (proven here for
  HSTS); the upstream's own headers (e.g. `X-Backend`) and body ride through the
  relay, confirmed on the wire by the deployed curl.

Nothing here is a new model: `serveStep` / `resumeStep` / `proxyRespTransform` are
the exact defs the leanc-compiled core runs behind `drorb_serve_step`, and the
backend id is the exact `Reactor.ProxyDial.pick` the io_uring shard crosses. The
host owns only the socket (dial the id → its configured address, move bytes); the
WHICH-backend decision and the reply transform are the proven core's.

/-! ## The backend pick is governed by the live mask -/

/-- **The deployed pick is governed by the mask.** The reverse proxy dials
`Reactor.ProxyDial.pick mask key`; whenever it returns a backend `id`, that
backend's bit is set in the live health/breaker `mask`. Equivalently: a backend
whose probe is down or whose breaker is open (bit clear) is NEVER the dialled
backend. This is the contrapositive of the proven `pick_health_ejects`, so it is
the running-path meaning of "eject an unhealthy upstream". -/

    mask.testBit id = true := by
  cases hc : mask.testBit id with
  | true  => rfl
  | false => exact absurd h (Reactor.ProxyDial.pick_health_ejects hc)

/-- **The pick is deterministic (single-valued) in `(mask, key)`.** Two picks over
the same live mask and the same affinity key agree — so a fixed session key pins
to one backend across requests (sticky affinity), given a stable health verdict. -/

/-! ## The forward reaches the picked backend and relays the reply faithfully -/

/-- **The deployed reverse-proxy forward is faithful.** For an api-path request
whose proven pick selects backend `id` over the live `mask`:

1. the deployed step forwards to EXACTLY that backend — it `.yield`s
   `proxyDial id input`, the id the proven pick chose, with the response-transform
   fold as its continuation (no host-side re-selection);
2. resuming the step with the upstream reply relays it through the proven
   `proxyRespTransform` — the reply parsed, run through the cors / gzip /
   security-headers / header fold, and re-serialized;
3. the dialled backend is genuinely up in the live mask (health honoured); and
4. the relayed response carries the transform's added header block — proven here
   for HSTS, so the relay demonstrably annotates the reply, not merely echoes it.

The upstream's own headers (`X-Backend`, `Content-Type`) and body pass through the
transform (only `Content-Length` is dropped and re-derived); that passthrough is
confirmed on the wire by the deployed `--io uring` curl. -/

/-! ## Runnable, concrete checks — the pick actually chooses and honours health

These reuse the deployed `Reactor.ProxyDial.pick` over the demo tier-0 fleet: the
same pure decision the io_uring shard crosses per request. They witness that the
hypotheses of `proxy_forwards_faithful` are genuinely satisfiable (the pick is not
vacuously `none`) and that the mask actually steers the dial. -/
