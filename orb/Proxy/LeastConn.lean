LeastConn — least-connections balancing over verified active-connection
accounting, composed with the probe-driven health machine.

This closes the least-connections load-balancing policy end to end: the input
`conns` field that the plain least-connections pick minimises is given a
*provenance* — it is the live in-flight count read out of an active-connection
accounting table with genuine open/close transitions — and the input `healthy`
field is given a provenance too — it is the verdict of the rise/fall health
machine run over that backend's probe history. Selection then filters to
eligible (healthy ∧ administratively active) backends and takes the minimal
in-flight one, ties broken toward the earlier list position.

Two pieces of accounting the reference load balancer keeps only implicitly are
made explicit and verified here:

  * `ConnTable` — a per-backend-id in-flight counter with `openConn`
    (a new upstream connection is dialed) and `closeConn` (a connection is
    returned/torn down). Unlike a cumulative request counter this one goes
    *down* on close, so it tracks concurrency, not throughput: an open/close
    pair is a round trip (`active_open_close_roundtrip`). This is exactly the
    quantity least-connections must minimise, and here it has transitions and
    frame lemmas rather than being an opaque input.

  * the health verdict is the `Health` machine's `up` bit, so an ejected /
    down backend — one the probe machine took Down, e.g. by a `fall`-long
    failure burst — is provably excluded from selection even when it carries
    the fewest in-flight connections (the tempting minimum).

Headline theorems:

  * `leastconn_picks_min`   — the chosen backend has the fewest active
    connections among all healthy-and-active backends (stated directly against
    the `active` accounting read);
  * `leastconn_respects_health` — the chosen backend's node passed the health
    machine (verdict Up) and is administratively active; a backend the health
    FSM took Down is never chosen, even at zero in-flight connections
    (`leastconn_skips_ejected_min` exhibits the mutant);
  * `leastconn_ties_stable` — ties are broken deterministically toward the
    earlier list position: every eligible backend appearing before the pick
    carries strictly more connections, so the pick is the unique earliest
    minimiser.

The plain-pick minimality/membership lemmas (`leastConn_min`, `leastConn_mem`,
`leastConn_total`) and the eligibility algebra (`eligibleOf`) are reused from
`Proxy.Balance`; the health machine (`hrun`, `down_at_fall`) from
`Proxy.Health`. Everything is a pure function over explicit state.

/-! ### Active-connection accounting

An in-flight connection counter keyed by backend id. A `ConnTable` is an
association list `id ↦ live-count`; `openConn` bumps the count on a new dial,
`closeConn` decrements it (floored at zero) on teardown, and `active` reads it
back. This is the concurrency counter least-connections minimises. -/

so the count never goes negative). -/

/-! ### Nodes and resolution

A `Node` is the raw configured upstream: identity, weight, tier, admin status,
plus the health machine's gate, its running state, and the probe history yet to
be folded in. `snapshot` resolves a node against the live `ConnTable` and its
probe history into a selection-time `Backend` — the `conns` field is the live
`active` read, the `healthy` field is the health machine's verdict. -/
