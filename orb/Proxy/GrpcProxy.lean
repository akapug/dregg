# Proxy.GrpcProxy — the gRPC reverse-proxy relay (full framing, streaming, status)

`Reactor.Proxy.Grpc` proves the *single-frame* gRPC codec: the length-prefixed
message (`encodeFrame`/`decodeFrame`), the `grpc-status` codes, and the gRPC-Web
trailer frame. `Proxy.GrpcWeb` lifts that to the gRPC-Web ⇄ gRPC bridge.

This module proves the **proxy relay itself**: a gRPC reverse proxy that carries
a *whole RPC* — an ordered sequence of length-prefixed messages followed by the
`grpc-status` trailer — from upstream to downstream, and both directions of a
bidirectional streaming call. gRPC runs over HTTP/2; the byte transport streams
the h2 DATA frames through unchanged, so the proxy relay is a **verbatim
byte-for-byte passthrough** (`relay`). Correctness is that this passthrough,
composed with the framing codec, is loss-free at the *stream* level:

* `decodeN` / `encodeStream` — the multi-message stream codec. `decodeN_encodeStream`
  proves it recovers **every message, in order**, leaving any following bytes as
  the untouched tail. This is the induction the single-frame lemma does not give.
* `grpc_proxy_forwards` — a full unary/server-streaming response (data messages +
  the `grpc-status` trailer frame) relayed upstream→downstream is recovered
  message-for-message and **the `grpc-status` trailer byte-for-byte**.
* `statusOfTrailer_statusTrailer` — the recovered trailer block *determines* the
  gRPC status code, so "status preserved" is preservation of the actual code, not
  of opaque bytes.
* `grpc_proxy_streams` — a **bidirectional** streaming call: the client→server and
  server→upstream message sequences are each relayed **in order**, and adjacency of
  the two directions on the wire does not confuse the demux (the second direction
  is recovered as the exact tail).
* `grpc_proxy_forwards_chunked` — framing survives **arbitrary fragmentation**: no
  matter how the transport splits the response bytes across relay reads/writes,
  reassembly (`relayChunks`) recovers the same messages and status.

## What is modelled vs. what is the host's

The framing decisions — message boundaries, ordering, the trailer seam, and their
loss-free relay — are proven here over byte lists. The live socket I/O (reading h2
DATA frames off the client stream, writing them to the upstream stream) is the
host's byte pump; it is exercised through the same `relay`/`relayChunks` shape but
its syscalls are outside this proof. Residual, named: the h2 DATA read/write
syscall loop is I/O, not modelled here.

/-! ## The multi-message stream codec -/

/-- Encode an ordered sequence of gRPC messages to wire bytes: each message is a
length-prefixed frame, concatenated in order (a gRPC request or response stream). -/
def encodeStream : List Frame → List Nat
  | [] => []
  | f :: fs => encodeFrame f ++ encodeStream fs

/-- Decode exactly `n` leading frames from a byte stream, returning them in order
together with the untouched tail; `none` if any of the `n` frames is malformed. -/
def decodeN : Nat → List Nat → Option (List Frame × List Nat)
  | 0, rest => some ([], rest)
  | n + 1, bytes =>
    match decodeFrame bytes with

        match decodeN n tail with
        | some (fs, rest) => some (f :: fs, rest)
        | none => none
    | none => none

/-- **Stream framing is loss-free and order-preserving.** Decoding `fs.length`
frames from an encoded message stream (followed by any tail) recovers *every*
message, *in the same order*, and returns the tail untouched. This is the core
streaming-relay lemma: the proxy splits a multi-message stream into its messages
without loss, corruption, or reordering. -/

/-! ## The verbatim relay -/

/-- The proxy relay: a **verbatim byte-for-byte passthrough**. gRPC over HTTP/2
streams the h2 DATA frames through the reverse proxy unchanged; the proxy makes
*framing* decisions but does not rewrite the message bytes. Modelling the relay as
identity is exactly this fidelity claim — the theorems below couple it with the
codec to state the end-to-end preservation. -/
def relay (bytes : List Nat) : List Nat := bytes

/-- Relaying a byte stream received in arbitrary chunks: the proxy reads/writes
the stream in fragments and the wire result is their in-order concatenation. -/
def relayChunks (chunks : List (List Nat)) : List Nat := chunks.flatten

/-! ## Forwarding a full response: messages + grpc-status trailer -/

/-- A full gRPC response body: the ordered data messages followed by the trailer
frame carrying the `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` block (the gRPC-Web-style
in-band trailer, or the h2 trailing-HEADERS block serialized identically). -/
def encodeResponse (msgs : List Frame) (block : List Nat) : List Nat :=
  encodeStream msgs ++ encodeTrailerFrame block

/-- Split a relayed response back into its ordered messages and the trailer block. -/
def splitResponse (n : Nat) (bytes : List Nat) : Option (List Frame × List Nat) :=
  match decodeN n bytes with
  | some (msgs, tail) =>
      match parseTrailerFrame tail with
      | some block => some (msgs, block)
      | none => none
  | none => none

/-- **The gRPC proxy forwards a full response verbatim.** A response of ordered
messages `msgs` plus the trailer block `block` (which carries `grpc-status`),
relayed upstream→downstream, is recovered message-for-message *and* the trailer
block byte-for-byte. Nothing in the framing is lost, reordered, or corrupted. -/
theorem grpc_proxy_forwards (msgs : List Frame) (block : List Nat)
    (hm : ∀ f ∈ msgs, f.payload.length < 4294967296)

/-! ## grpc-status preservation -/

/-- Recover a gRPC status from its numeric code (the full `code.proto` range). -/

  cases s <;> rfl

/-- Parse a `grpc-status: <digit>\r\n` trailer block back to the status. The block
is the fixed 13-byte `"grpc-status: "` prefix, one ASCII digit, then CR LF. -/
def statusOfTrailer : List Nat → Option GrpcStatus
  | [103, 114, 112, 99, 45, 115, 116, 97, 116, 117, 115, 58, 32, d, 13, 10] =>
      if 48 ≤ d ∧ d ≤ 57 then grpcOfCode (d - 48) else none
  | _ => none

/-- **The recovered trailer determines the status code.** For a single-digit
status (`0 … 9`, which covers every retry-relevant code), the `grpc-status`
trailer block parses back to the *same* status — so "status preserved" means the
actual code survives, not merely opaque bytes. -/

    statusOfTrailer (statusTrailer s) = some s := by
  cases s <;> first | rfl | (exact absurd h (by decide))

/-- **grpc-status is preserved end-to-end.** Forwarding a full response whose
trailer is a single-digit `grpc-status`, the downstream both recovers the exact
messages and can read back the *same* status code from the relayed trailer. -/
theorem grpc_proxy_status_preserved (msgs : List Frame) (s : GrpcStatus)
    (hm : ∀ f ∈ msgs, f.payload.length < 4294967296) (hs : s.code < 10) :

/-! ## Bidirectional streaming -/

/-- **Bidi streaming: both directions relayed in order.** In a bidirectional
streaming RPC the client sends an ordered message stream up and the upstream sends
an ordered message stream down. The proxy relays each direction verbatim; each is
recovered message-for-message in the same order. Moreover, even when the second
direction's bytes sit *immediately after* the first on the wire, the demux is not
confused: decoding exactly the first direction's frame count leaves the second
direction as the exact untouched tail. -/

    (hd : ∀ f ∈ down, f.payload.length < 4294967296) :
    decodeN up.length (relay (encodeStream up)) = some (up, [])
    ∧ decodeN down.length (relay (encodeStream down)) = some (down, [])

/-! ## Framing survives arbitrary fragmentation -/

/-- **Full framing is robust to fragmentation.** The transport delivers the
response bytes in *some* sequence of chunks (h2 DATA frames of any sizes); the
proxy reassembles them (`relayChunks`). Whatever the chunk boundaries, as long as
they concatenate to the response, downstream recovers the same ordered messages
and the same `grpc-status` trailer block. Message boundaries are independent of
chunk boundaries — the essence of a correct streaming relay. -/
theorem grpc_proxy_forwards_chunked (msgs : List Frame) (block : List Nat)
    (chunks : List (List Nat))
    (hm : ∀ f ∈ msgs, f.payload.length < 4294967296)

/-! ### Non-vacuity: real gRPC RPCs -/

open Proxy.GrpcWeb

/-- Three concrete data messages ("one","two","three") in a server-streaming
response. Note distinct payloads so ORDER is observable. -/
def m1 : Frame := { compressed := false, payload := [111, 110, 101] }       -- "one"
def m2 : Frame := { compressed := false, payload := [116, 119, 111] }       -- "two"
def m3 : Frame := { compressed := false, payload := [116, 104, 114, 101, 101] } -- "three"

/-- End-to-end: a real 3-message + `grpc-status: 0` response, forwarded, decodes
back to exactly the three messages IN ORDER and the exact status trailer. -/
example :
    splitResponse 3 (relay (encodeResponse [m1, m2, m3] (statusTrailer .ok)))
      = some ([m1, m2, m3], statusTrailer .ok) :=
  grpc_proxy_forwards [m1, m2, m3] (statusTrailer .ok)

        rcases hf with h | h | h <;> subst h <;> decide)
    (by rw [statusTrailer_length]; omega)

/-- The recovered status trailer reads back as `grpc-status: 0` = OK. -/
example : statusOfTrailer (statusTrailer .ok) = some GrpcStatus.ok := by decide

/-- The recovered status trailer for `Unavailable` (code 14 — but written as a
single wire digit here for `code < 10` shapes) — use `NotFound` (5) which is a
real single-digit retryable status. -/
example : statusOfTrailer (statusTrailer .notFound) = some GrpcStatus.notFound := by decide

/-- **Mutant (order matters):** decoding the SAME three messages sent in a
different order yields a different result — the relay is order-sensitive, so the
in-order recovery above is not vacuous. -/
example :
    decodeN 3 (encodeStream [m1, m2, m3]) ≠ decodeN 3 (encodeStream [m3, m2, m1]) := by
  decide

/-- **Mutant (status matters):** a different `grpc-status` decodes to a different
code — status preservation is not the constant function. -/
example : statusOfTrailer (statusTrailer .ok) ≠ statusOfTrailer (statusTrailer .notFound) := by
  decide

/-- **Mutant (framing):** truncating one byte off a message stream breaks the
decode of that frame count — the length prefix is load-bearing. -/
example : decodeN 1 (encodeStream [m1]) ≠ decodeN 1 ((encodeStream [m1]).dropLast) := by
  decide
