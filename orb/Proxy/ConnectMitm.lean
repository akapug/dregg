# Proxy.ConnectMitm — PARITY row conn.2: CONNECT MITM interception (TLS termination)

Row conn.1 (`ProxyConnectTunnel`) covers the *blind* CONNECT tunnel: once the
`200` is sent the edge forwards bytes verbatim in both directions and never
inspects them. Row conn.2 is the opposite disposition of the same CONNECT: when
the target is on the MITM allowlist, the edge does **not** blind-relay — it
*terminates* the client's TLS locally (so the proxy holds the plaintext for
inspection), then *re-establishes* a distinct TLS session to the real upstream
and re-encrypts. A target that is **not** configured for interception falls back
to the row-conn.1 blind relay, unchanged.

This leaf models the interception *decision and session structure* — which
disposition a CONNECT takes, and that an intercepted tunnel is genuinely two
distinct TLS legs with the proxy in the clear between them. It proves:

  * `connect_mitm_terminates_tls` — a target on the MITM allowlist is
    intercepted (not blind-relayed): the outcome is a terminated client leg with
    the proxy holding the decrypted plaintext (`plaintextVisible = true`).
  * `connect_mitm_reencrypts` — the intercepted tunnel is two *distinct* TLS
    sessions: the client-facing leg and the upstream-facing leg carry different
    session ids, both established, and the upstream leg terminates against the
    real target host (the proxy re-encrypts to the genuine upstream).
  * `connect_mitm_only_configured` — a target absent from the allowlist is
    *blind-relayed*, not intercepted: the outcome is the row-conn.1 opened
    `Tunnel`, whose relay is byte-verbatim (reusing `open_relay_faithful_up`),
    and never an intercepted tunnel.

No crypto is modeled: "TLS terminated at the proxy" is the decision plus the
plaintext-visibility flag; "distinct sessions" is distinct session ids by
construction; the handshake bytes, cert minting, and key exchange are the host's
(the leaf-cert minting orchestration is proven separately in the forward-proxy
module). The two legs' session ids are derived (`2·seed`, `2·seed+1`) so their
distinctness is a *proved* fact, not an assumption.

/-- **conn.2 — a configured CONNECT terminates TLS at the proxy.** When the
target is on the MITM allowlist, the CONNECT is *intercepted*: the outcome is a
terminated tunnel whose client leg is established at the proxy and whose proxy
holds the decrypted plaintext for inspection — it is not the blind relay of row
conn.1. The `intercepts t = true` hypothesis is a real allowlist-membership fact
(the mutant below shows the disposition genuinely depends on it), not `P → P`. -/

/-- **conn.2 — re-encryption to the upstream is a distinct session.** An
intercepted CONNECT is two *different* TLS sessions: the client-facing leg and
the upstream-facing leg carry different session ids, both handshakes complete,
and the upstream leg terminates against the genuine target host — i.e. the proxy
does not splice one session end-to-end, it decrypts and re-encrypts across two.
The `intercepts t = true` hypothesis is load-bearing (an unconfigured target has
no such tunnel — see `connect_mitm_only_configured`). -/

the MITM allowlist is blind-relayed, not intercepted: the outcome is exactly the
row-conn.1 opened `Tunnel` (whose relay is byte-verbatim, reusing
`open_relay_faithful_up`), and it is never an intercepted tunnel — the proxy
never holds that target's plaintext. The `intercepts t = false` hypothesis is a
real non-membership fact. -/

/-! ## Mutant — the allowlist is load-bearing

A mutant handler that intercepts *every* target (ignoring the policy) would
break `connect_mitm_only_configured`: it would hold the plaintext of a target the
policy never authorized for interception. We witness that the real handler's
disposition genuinely depends on the allowlist. -/

/-- The mutant: intercept regardless of policy. -/
def handleConnectMutant (t : Target) (seed : Nat) : Outcome :=
  .intercepted (buildIntercept t seed)

/-- **The allowlist is load-bearing.** For a target *not* on the allowlist, the
real handler blind-relays while the policy-ignoring mutant intercepts — they
disagree exactly where the policy says "do not intercept". (If instead the target
were configured, both would intercept the same tunnel and agree — so the
`intercepts t = false` hypothesis is essential, i.e. non-vacuous.) -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity: concrete intercept / relay dispositions

String host equality does not reduce in the kernel, so these membership
witnesses evaluate via `native_decide`; they are only witnesses — the
load-bearing content is the four theorems above, proven by `simp`/`omega` over
abstract membership hypotheses. -/

def demoPolicy : MitmPolicy := { hosts := ["corp.internal"] }

/-- A configured target is genuinely on the allowlist. -/

  native_decide

/-- An unconfigured target is genuinely off the allowlist. -/
example : demoPolicy.intercepts { host := "bank.example", port := 443 } = false := by
  native_decide

/-- A configured target is intercepted, with the proxy holding the plaintext and
two distinct sessions (`0` client / `1` upstream from seed `0`). -/
example :
    handleConnect demoPolicy { host := "corp.internal", port := 443 } 0
      = .intercepted
        { target := { host := "corp.internal", port := 443 }
          clientLeg := { peer := "client", sessionId := 0, established := true }
          upstreamLeg := { peer := "corp.internal", sessionId := 1, established := true }
          plaintextVisible := true } := by native_decide

/-- An unconfigured target is blind-relayed with the row-conn.1 opened tunnel —
the proxy never sees its plaintext. -/
example :
    handleConnect demoPolicy { host := "bank.example", port := 443 } 0
      = .relayed Tunnel.opened := by native_decide
