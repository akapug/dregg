# Reactor.StandingCounters — the accept-path per-source counter store as an LTS

The proven serve stages `Reactor.Stage.ConnLimit` / `StickTable` / `Slowloris`
DECIDE on per-source STANDING state (how many connections a source has open right
now, its aggregated request rate, how long its header phase has run). The sans-IO
serve fold is one stateless `ByteArray → ByteArray` call per request
(`ctxOfMetered` carries only the client IP + a per-connection sequence number), so
that standing state cannot ride the fold — it lives in the ACCEPT PATH, which owns
the connection lifecycle. This file models that accept-path store, mirroring the
`Uring/Conservation.lean` proof style (an LTS + a conservation law), and proves the
connection-limit enforcement it now realizes in the reactor
(`crates/dataplane/src/{uring,kqueue,blocking}.rs` + `standing.rs`).

## The model

A single per-source counter store `St := Ip → Nat` (active concurrent connections
per source). Two actions drive it, matching the two edges the reactor owns:

* `accept ip` — a connection from `ip` is accepted; the source's active count is
  incremented. The reactor calls `Standing::on_accept` here, exactly once per
  connection that enters the slab.
* `close ip` — a connection from `ip` closes; the count is decremented. GUARDED by
  `0 < s ip`: you can only close what is open. The reactor calls
  `Standing::on_close` here, exactly once per connection, on the single close funnel
  every path (served / refused / EOF / error) exits through.

## What is proved

* `conn_conservation` — in every reachable state, `active(ip) + #close(ip) =
  #accept(ip)`, hence `active(ip) = #accept(ip) − #close(ip)` and, on `Nat`, never
  negative. This is the decrement-EXACTLY-once discipline: the count reflects the
  real accept/close history with no drift.
* `close_le_accept` — `#close(ip) ≤ #accept(ip)` always: the counter never
  underflows (no leak that would wedge the limiter permanently).
* `conn_limit_fires` — a source at/over the cap makes the accept gate `.refuse` the
  REAL `Reactor.Stage.ConnLimit.resp503` (the proven `admits_over`).
* `conn_limit_transparent` — a source under the cap is `.admit`ted (pass through,
  the serve's bytes untouched — the proven `admits_under`).
* `flood_refused` / `init_admitted` — a concrete reachable 5-deep flood at cap 4 is
  refused while the fresh store admits: the gate genuinely distinguishes, so nothing
  above is vacuous.

/-! ## The request-rate window — a per-source AGING counter (the `429` gate)

The connection counter above is decremented once per close; the request-rate counter
is a different discipline — it AGES by TIME. Each source has a fixed window that
counts request arrivals and, once the window's span elapses, RESETS (the reactor's
`Standing::rate_note` resets `count` to `0` when `now - start ≥ window`). We model the
window as an LTS with two edges — `req ip` (an arrival: `+1`) and `roll ip` (the window
ages: reset to `0`) — and prove the window count is exactly the arrivals in the current
window (`rate_window_conservation`), that a `roll` genuinely ages it to zero (no leak,
the recovery edge), and that a source over the cap makes the gate refuse the REAL proven
`Reactor.Stage.StickTable.resp429` (`rate_limit_fires`, composing `admits_over`). -/
