# Reactor.Stage.CompressBody — the LZ meta-block body (parity row `mw.2b`)

`Reactor.Stage.CompressExt` closed the zstd/brotli **container**: negotiation, the
frame magic, and the integrity trailer. Its one named residual was *the entropy-coded
body itself* — "the FSE/Huffman-and-LZ zstd block, the brotli meta-block bitstream".
This module closes that residual's provable core: **the LZ77 sequence layer** that is
the shared heart of both codings (zstd's `Sequences` section, brotli's insert-and-copy
commands), with a proven lossless round-trip, a real back-reference decoder, and the
window / block-size well-formedness that the header fields advertise.

## The model

An LZ meta-block body is a list of `Tok`ens: a `lit b` emits one literal byte; a
`copy dist len` copies `len` bytes from `dist` positions back in the output produced so
far — the sliding-window back-reference. Distances may be **shorter than the length**
(overlapping copy), which is how both codings encode runs: `copy 1 n` repeats the last
byte `n` times (RLE), `copy 2 n` repeats the last two bytes, and so on. `decode` replays
the token stream left-to-right against the growing window (`lzDecode`).

## What is proven (all 0-sorry, axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound})

* **`rle_roundtrip`** — the headline losslessness: for *any* byte string, a real
  run-length LZ encoder (`rleEncode`, which genuinely emits `copy` tokens) decodes back
  to the exact input. `lzDecode (rleEncode bs) = bs`. Non-vacuous: `rleEncode_compresses`
  exhibits a run collapsing to a `lit` + `copy` pair (real compression, not a literal
  passthrough).

* **`backref_period_2`** — a distance-2 back-reference genuinely reconstructs a periodic
  string (`[1,2] → 1,2,1,2,1,2`), proving the window copy is a real dictionary reference,
  not just RLE.

* **`decode_size`** — the decoded size is exactly `#literals + Σ copy-lengths`: the
  block's advertised content size (zstd `Frame_Content_Size`, brotli `MLEN`) is met on
  the nose. `copyN_length` is the window-copy size law it rests on.

* **`window_safe`** — the meaning of the window-log header field: a copy whose distance is
  within the produced output (`1 ≤ dist ≤ |out|`) reads a byte that was **genuinely in
  the window** (`byteBack out dist ∈ out`) — never an out-of-range default. This is the
  "no reference before the start of the block / beyond the window" safety property.

* **`header_wf` / `block_size_matches`** — a meta-block header (final flag, window-log,
  content size) is well-formed when its window-log is in the RFC-legal band and its
  advertised size matches what the body decodes to.

* **`body_stack_roundtrip`** — the layering: for any lawful sequence serializer, the LZ
  body threaded through `CompressExt`'s proven container round-trips end to end
  (`src → rleEncode → serialize → container → unwrap → parse → lzDecode = src`).

## Honest follow-ons (the entropy stage proper)

The FSE/tANS numeric decoder (zstd) and the full brotli context-modeling + canonical
Huffman entropy stage — and the concrete bit-level sequence serializer — remain named
follow-ons; this module proves the LZ layer they sit atop, plus the window/size
well-formedness the headers carry.
