# Reactor.Stage.Slowloris — the slow-header-arrival defense GATE

A byte-driving `Stage` for the extensible serve fold: on the request phase it
checks how long the client has taken to deliver its request headers and, when that
span has reached the configured header timeout, short-circuits the whole pipeline
with a `408 Request Timeout` — the handler and every later stage are skipped. A
request whose headers arrived in time passes through untouched.

This is the classic slowloris defense: a client that opens a connection and then
dribbles header bytes far below line rate (holding the worker) is dropped once its
header phase overruns the timeout, rather than being allowed to pin the slot.

## The decision core — a real bounded timeout test

`expired timeout started now` is the exact expiry rule: with the protection enabled
(`timeout ≠ 0`) a connection is expired iff the elapsed header span `now - started`
has reached `timeout` (i.e. `started + timeout ≤ now`). A `timeout` of `0` disables
the protection — nothing ever expires. This is the total form of the reference
`check_expired` (`now.duration_since(started) ≥ timeout`, gated on a non-zero
timeout).

Because the sans-IO serve is one stateless call per request, the connection's
header-phase start clock and the current clock ride in the attribute bag under
`startedKey` / `nowKey` (their byte-lengths are the clock readings the accept path
supplies). A connection whose start is far enough in the past reconstructs an
elapsed span at or over the timeout, and the REAL `expired` decision drops it.

The effect is a genuine change to the emitted bytes:

* `slowStage_gate_build` — expired, the built pipeline response IS the `408`;
* `slowStage_pass` — in time, the stage is transparent (the handler's bytes);
* `slowStage_changes_bytes` — same handler, an expired and a fresh connection emit
  *different* status bytes: the gate really drives the wire.

`expired` truth-table lemmas (`expired_disabled`, `expired_in_time`,
`expired_at_timeout`, `expired_over`) and the concrete contexts (`slowCtx_expired`,
`freshCtx_ok`, closed by `decide`) keep all of this non-vacuous.
