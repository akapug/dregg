# Autoindex — directory index / autoindex listing (RFC 9110 §7.1, §15.3)

A sans-IO model of the directory-index stage a static file server owes when a
request target resolves to a *directory* rather than a regular file. It closes
three obligations, all reusing the traversal discipline the file handler already
proves (`Safety.Traversal.serveStatic`), never a fresh path routine:

  * **Index precedence.** A directory is first probed for a configured index
    document (`index.html`, `index.htm`, …). The FIRST configured index name
    that names an existing regular file is served *as that file*; the generated
    listing is produced only when none exists. This is the ordered "directory
    index" fallback of RFC 9110 §7.1 target resolution — a served index is a
    normal `200`, not a machine-generated page.

  * **Listing.** With no index present, the directory's entries are rendered as
    an HTML document: one link row per entry name, under a heading naming the
    request path. Every listed entry appears as its own row.

  * **No escape.** Every link the listing emits points at `reqTarget ++ [name]`
    — the current request path extended by a single entry component — and is
    resolved back through the SAME `serveStatic` discipline. So following any
    listed link keeps the document root as a path prefix, even for an adversarial
    entry name (a literal `..`) and even under a filesystem walker that actually
    pops on `..` (`Route.Path.descend`). The listing is incapable of minting an
    escaping href because it re-uses the proven-safe resolver.

The filesystem is the uninterpreted boundary: `existsFile` (is there a regular
file at a resolved path), `isDir`, and `readDir` (a directory's entry names, each
a single path component) enter as total fields of `DirConfig`. The theorems are
about the index-vs-listing *selection* and the *hrefs* it emits, not about any
real disk.

Theorems:
  * `autoindex_index_precedence` — a present index file is served instead of the
    listing (and the result is provably NOT a listing).
  * `resolveIndex_first`         — precedence picks the FIRST existing index name.
  * `autoindex_lists_dir`        — a directory with no index renders a listing in
    which every entry name appears as its own link row.
  * `autoindex_no_escape`        — every listed link resolves under the document
    root (prefix form, and under a popping walker), for real listed entries and
    for an adversarial `..` entry.

/-! ## Theorem 1 — index precedence -/

/-- **`autoindex_index_precedence`.** When the directory contains an index file
(the ordered probe resolves to `n`), the stage serves that file — the resolved
index path — and the result is provably NOT a generated listing. An index masks
the autoindex page (RFC 9110 §7.1 directory-index fallback). -/

/-- **`autoindex_lists_dir`.** A directory with no index file renders an HTML
listing of its entries: the stage returns `listing` carrying exactly the
directory's entries and the rendered document, and every entry name in the
directory shows up as its own link row in that listing. -/

/-! ## Theorem 3 — no escape -/

/-- **`autoindex_no_escape` (prefix form).** Every link the listing emits points
at `entryTarget reqTarget name`, and resolving that through the file handler's
own discipline keeps the document root as a path prefix — no listed link, for
ANY entry name however adversarial, escapes the root. -/

    (name : String) :
    cfg.docRoot <+: resolveDir cfg (entryTarget reqTarget name) :=
  Safety.Traversal.serveStatic_root_prefix cfg.docRoot (entryTarget reqTarget name)

/-- **`autoindex_no_escape` under a popping walker.** Even interpreting the
resolved link path with `descend` — which actually pops a component on `..` — a
clean document root stays a prefix. The stage cannot mint an href that climbs out
of the root, because the listed entry is re-resolved by the same dot-segment
stripper before any pop can fire. -/
theorem autoindex_no_escape_descend (cfg : DirConfig) (reqTarget : List String)
    (name : String)

    cfg.docRoot <+: Route.Path.descend [] (resolveDir cfg (entryTarget reqTarget name)) :=
  Safety.Traversal.serveStatic_no_escape cfg.docRoot (entryTarget reqTarget name) hclean

/-! ## Concrete adversarial witness (non-vacuity of no-escape) -/

/-- An adversarial listing entry literally named `..` under `/srv/www`, listed
from `pub`, still resolves under the root: the link target `["pub",".."]` clamps
to `["srv","www"]` — it climbs back to the root but never above it. This is the
listing analogue of `serveStatic_dotdot_confined`. -/
theorem autoindex_dotdot_entry_confined :
    resolveDir ⟨["srv", "www"], fun _ => false, fun _ => true, fun _ => [], []⟩
        (entryTarget ["pub"] "..")
      = ["srv", "www"] := by decide

/-- A listing whose entry name would traverse (`..`) resolves strictly under the
root when the current path has depth: from `a/b`, an entry `..` links to
`["a","b",".."]` which clamps to `["srv","www","a"]` — one level up, still under
root. -/
theorem autoindex_dotdot_entry_confined_deep :
    resolveDir ⟨["srv", "www"], fun _ => false, fun _ => true, fun _ => [], []⟩
        (entryTarget ["a", "b"] "..")
      = ["srv", "www", "a"] := by decide

/-! ## HTML-escaping hygiene (bonus) -/

/-- `htmlEscape` neutralizes a raw `<` (markup-injection guard for entry names). -/
theorem htmlEscape_neutralizes_lt :
    htmlEscape "<script>" = "&lt;script&gt;" := by decide

/-! ## Concrete listing witness (the renderer actually runs) -/

/-- A concrete two-entry directory produces exactly two link rows, one per entry,
each an `<li><a …>` naming the entry — the renderer computes real HTML. -/
theorem listingRows_example :
    listingRows ["docs"] ["a.txt", "sub"] =
      ["<li><a href=\"/docs/a.txt\">a.txt</a></li>",
       "<li><a href=\"/docs/sub\">sub</a></li>"] := by decide
