# Reactor.DriveProxy — the Phase-2 effect-scheduler proof (`drive_proxy_refines`)

The proxy **effect program** is proven ONCE, in tree, exactly like the cache arm:
`Reactor.ServeStep.serveStep` / `resumeStep` decide the whole fabric (whether to
proxy, WHICH backend, what to serve on the upstream reply) and the proxy-arm
theorems fix its meaning:

* `serveStep_proxy_yields` — a proxy request `.yield`s `.proxyDial id input` to the
  proven-picked backend, with the full response-transform fold as its continuation;
* `serveStep_backend_up` — the yielded backend is genuinely up (`mask.testBit id`);
* `serveStep_proxy_resume` — resuming on the upstream reply `.done`s
  `proxyRespTransform input upstream` (the reply parsed, run through
  cors / gzip / security-headers / header, and re-serialized);
* `Reactor.ServeStream.proxy_emit_refines` — the STREAMED upstream body (bounded RSS,
  never buffered whole) is byte-equal to the buffered proxy delivery.

The **per-scheduler** obligation — the one thing the io_uring reactor adds — is a
REFINEMENT: the reactor's effect-driving loop feeds the upstream reply bytes into the
serve continuation. This file discharges it for the PROXY effect, following the
Phase-1 `Reactor.DriveCache` template exactly.

## The seam the driver crosses (identical to the cache arm)

`Reactor.Contract` is the copy-once WIRE reactor: `RingEvent.effectComplete` (added
additively in Phase 1) is the effect-completion edge. It is INERT at the wire FSM —
its result bytes do NOT belong to `Proto` — and is consumed HERE, threaded into
`resumeStep`. For a proxy the `effectComplete` payload is the UPSTREAM REPLY (the id
the reactor dialed via `connectUpstream` / `sendUpstream`, whose bytes the recv-loop
accumulated). The driver (`driveProxy`) is the SAME generic result-threading loop as
`driveCache` — the effect scheduler is generic; only the effect KIND (and the proven
arm theorems that give its meaning) differ. `driveProxy` reuses
`Reactor.DriveCache.resultsOf` verbatim.

## What `drive_proxy_refines` proves (and does not)

`drive_proxy_refines` proves the MODEL — the Contract reactor threading the upstream
reply CQE into the proven serve — drives the proxy effect faithfully:

* the reactor submits `.proxyDial id input` with the PROVEN-picked backend
  (`serveStep_proxy_yields`), and that backend is genuinely up
  (`serveStep_backend_up`);
* an `effectComplete upstream` carrying the upstream reply drives to
  `proxyRespTransform input upstream` — the reply parsed, transformed, re-serialized
  (`serveStep_proxy_resume`).

The bytes fed into the continuation are exactly the effect payload carried by the
ingress event (`resultsOf`), so this is a real refinement — the reactor feeds the
UPSTREAM's actual reply, not an invented one. `drive_proxy_batch` further composes the
proxy drive with `proxy_emit_refines`, so the reactor-driven (buffered) proxy response
equals the STREAMED emit (head chunk ++ paced upstream-body chunks) for any chunk size
— the design's `uring_serve = <streaming factor> ∘ resumeStep_semantics ∘
drive_effects_refines`, with `proxy_emit_refines` the proxy streaming factor (so a
native SQE proxy need not materialize the whole upstream body).

**The realization boundary (honest).** This proves the MODEL. The Rust io_uring proxy
dispatch (the `TAG_YIELD_PROXY` arm) REALIZES this model — it submits the connect /
send / recv SQEs on a second fd, accumulates the upstream reply, and delivers those
bytes to `drorb_serve_resume`. That realization is the SAME named gap as reactor-model
↔ `uring.rs` (it is NOT proven here; it is the model's realization boundary). The Rust
is not claimed proven.

/-- **THE PHASE-2 THEOREM — `drive_proxy_refines`.** For a proxy request whose proven
pick finds an eligible backend, the reactor threading the upstream-reply CQE into the
proven serve drives the proxy effect faithfully, all obligations at once:

1. it first submits `.proxyDial id input` with the PROVEN-picked backend
   (`serveStep_proxy_yields`);
2. that backend is genuinely up — `mask.testBit id = true` (`serveStep_backend_up`), so
   the routing hypothesis has a real forced consequence (not a self-contradictory,
   vacuously-dischargeable premise);
3. for ANY upstream reply, the `effectComplete upstream` drives to
   `proxyRespTransform input upstream` — the reply parsed, transformed, re-serialized.

The bytes fed into the continuation are the effect payload carried by the ingress event
(`resultsOf`), and the output is the proven proxy semantics — so the io_uring proxy
dispatch (modelled here) is a faithful interpreter of the proven serve program. Not
vacuous: the yield names a genuinely-up backend, and each upstream reply maps to a
specific, upstream-dependent transformed response (see the runnable checks: the
threaded response carries real HSTS, and the upstream body flows verbatim into the
streamed output). Reuses the proxy-arm theorems verbatim; only the driving is new. -/

/-! ## Composing the drive refinement with the STREAMED proxy emit

The design's chain is `uring_serve = <streaming factor> ∘ resumeStep_semantics ∘
drive_effects_refines`. `drive_proxy_refines` is the `drive_effects_refines` factor;
`serveStep_proxy_resume` is the `resumeStep_semantics` it reuses; the proxy streaming
factor is `Reactor.ServeStream.proxy_emit_refines` (NOT `serveTrace_refines`, which is
the NON-proxy deployed serve — the proxy body is the upstream reply, not the deployed
fold). Here they compose: the reactor-driven (buffered) proxy response is byte-for-byte
the streamed emit — the head chunk (core-built) followed by the paced upstream-body
chunks — whatever the chunk size. So a native SQE proxy can STREAM the upstream body
(bounded RSS) and still deliver exactly the bytes this drive produces. -/

/-- **The reactor-driven proxy response equals the STREAMED emit, at any chunk size.**
The bytes the reactor produces after driving the proxy dial (`drive_proxy_dial`) are
exactly what a streaming proxy emits: the response HEAD as one chunk, then the upstream
body streamed host-side from a window `bodyWin` (whose bytes are the transformed
response body) paced into bounded `cfg.chunk` chunks (`proxy_emit_refines`). The only
hypothesis on the stream is that the body window carries the transformed body — the
faithfulness the shell's upstream-recv owes. Per-scheduler drive refinement composed
with the streamed-body refinement, end to end. -/

/-! ## The HEAD/BODY-SPLIT proxy drive (the native STREAMING prerequisite)

`drive_proxy_dial` feeds ONE `effectComplete upstream` carrying the WHOLE reply — the
native path must buffer the whole body. A native STREAMING io_uring proxy instead
delivers the core-decided response HEAD (`ServeStep.proxyRespHead`) as the first
completion and the transformed body as a SEQUENCE of body-chunk completions streamed
host-side (bounded RSS, never buffered whole). `driveProxyStream` threads that head +
body-chunk sequence through `ServeStep.proxyStreamResume`; `drive_proxy_stream_refines`
proves it reaches the SAME `.done` bytes as the buffered `drive_proxy_dial`. This is the
theorem a native SQE proxy realizes: it need not materialize the whole upstream body.

`drive_proxy_stream_emits` closes the loop through the Stage-3 streaming factor
`Reactor.ServeStream.proxy_emit_refines`: the actual streamed emit (the head chunk
followed by the paced body chunks, `srcChunkList`) is byte-for-byte the split drive's
result — so the streamed delivery equals the buffered proxy response at any chunk size.

**Residual (honest, carried from `ServeStep`).** `ServeStep.proxyRespHead` carries the
derived `Content-Length` (a function of the transformed body length; the gzip stage
genuinely re-encodes the body). So this proves head-FIRST delivery is faithful to the
buffered bytes, not yet head-BEFORE-body emission. The minimal additional lemma to
unlock true zero-buffer early-head streaming is a head that is independent of the body
bytes (upstream `Content-Length` trust + a body-length-preserving transform, or chunked
transfer-encoding) — the deferred scan-gated early-head obligation `ServeStream` names. -/

/-- Feeding a list of effect-result payloads as `effectComplete` events recovers exactly
those payloads through `resultsOf` (the wire events carry none). -/
theorem resultsOf_effectCompletes (rs : List Bytes) :
    Reactor.DriveCache.resultsOf (rs.map RingEvent.effectComplete) = rs := by
  induction rs with
  | nil => rfl
  | cons r rs ih =>
    show r :: Reactor.DriveCache.resultsOf (rs.map RingEvent.effectComplete) = r :: rs
    rw [ih]

/-- **The reactor's HEAD/BODY-SPLIT proxy driver.** The first effect completion is the
core-decided response HEAD; the remaining completions are the transformed body streamed
as chunks. The reactor assembles `head ++ (body chunks)` via `ServeStep.proxyStreamResume`
— the streamed proxy response, the whole body never buffered in the core. Reuses
`Reactor.DriveCache.resultsOf` verbatim; the body chunks flow as ordinary completions. -/

  | head :: chunks => ServeStep.proxyStreamResume head chunks

/-- **THE HEAD/BODY-SPLIT PROXY DRIVE REFINEMENT — `drive_proxy_stream_refines`.** For a
proxy request whose proven pick finds an eligible backend, the reactor delivering the
core-decided response HEAD (`ServeStep.proxyRespHead`) as the first completion and the
transformed body as a SEQUENCE of streamed chunks (whose concatenation is the transformed
body) drives to the SAME `.done` bytes as the buffered whole-reply drive
(`drive_proxy_dial`) — `proxyRespTransform input upstream`, byte-for-byte. So a NATIVE
streaming io_uring proxy that never buffers the whole upstream body in the core realizes
exactly the proven proxy semantics. Faithful (proven EQUAL to the buffered drive),
non-vacuous (`hpick` forces `id` genuinely up; the head carries real HSTS; the body
chunks are the real transformed body split). -/
