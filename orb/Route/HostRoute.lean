Route.HostRoute — host-based virtual routing (LEDGER row rt.host).

A request's authoritative host (Host header / SNI authority) selects a
virtual-host route table. Selection is by a THREE-CLASS precedence over the
host pattern, independent of table order:

  * `exact`   — the request host labels equal the pattern (rank 2, highest);
  * `wild`    — the leading-label wildcard `*.rest`, one arbitrary leading
                label followed by `rest` (rank 1);
  * `default` — the fallback authority, matches unconditionally (rank 0).

So `api.example.com` selects an exact `api.example.com` block over a wildcard
`*.example.com` block over the default block, even if the wildcard/default
blocks appear earlier in the table. Within one class the earliest block in
table order wins (first-match tie-break, no ambiguity).

This is the authority-selection layer only: each virtual host carries an
abstract route table `H` (the per-host path router, e.g. the sibling
`Route.Match` / `RouteAdvanced` matcher, is `H`'s job). Selecting a virtual
host hands the request to THAT host's table and no other — the isolation
property `host_route_no_leak` below.

Boundaries (named, uninterpreted):
  * HOST EXTRACTION — the request host arrives as an already-split, already
    lower-cased, port-stripped label list. The Host-header ABNF parse, the SNI
    extension parse, and case-folding happen upstream; they are not modeled.
  * Any cryptographic authority binding (the TLS handshake that authenticates
    the SNI-selected host) is an opaque oracle discharged elsewhere; here the
    host label list is taken as given and only the pure selection DECISION over
    it is proven.

Theorems:
  * `host_route_dispatch` — the selected block's host matches the request, and
    it is a HIGHEST-precedence match: exact > wildcard > default. No matching
    block outranks the chosen one.
  * `host_route_no_leak`  — a request for host A is never served by a block
    bound to a different exact host B (A's request never hits B's table).
  * `host_route_default`  — with no exact and no wildcard match, a request falls
    through to the default block (and only the default block).

Concrete `decide` witnesses (`H := Nat`) show each class is real and distinct.
Core-only Lean (no Mathlib), no crypto engine, no external axioms.

/-! ## Concrete witnesses — each precedence class is real and distinct (`H := Nat`)

A three-block table (declared wild-first, exact-second, default-last, so the
result cannot be an artifact of table order) discriminates the three classes:
`api.example.com` → the exact block; `www.example.com` → the wildcard block;
`other.org` → the default block. Three DIFFERENT route tables fire. -/

    { host := .default,                            routes := 0 } ]

/-- **Exact beats wildcard (and beats order).** `api.example.com` matches both
the wildcard `*.example.com` (which appears first) and the exact block, and the
exact block's table (`1`) is chosen. -/
theorem demo_exact_wins :

`*.example.com` table (`2`) is chosen over the default. -/

falls through to the default table (`0`). -/
theorem demo_default_fallthrough :
    (selectHost tables ["other", "org"]).map (·.routes) = some 0 := by
  decide

/-- **No-leak is real.** The `api.example.com` request never selects the
`b.example.net` exact block, whichever tables are present. -/
