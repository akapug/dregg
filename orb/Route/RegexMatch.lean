Route.RegexMatch — regular-expression route matching, modelled as a
deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with an anchored, longest/most-specific
dispatch.

Motivation. The flat precedence router (`Route.Match`) and the host/glob router
(`RouteAdvanced`) match by exact / prefix / `*` / `**` segment classes. A regex
route (a `~ pattern` style location) matches a request PATH against a compiled
regular expression. Two hazards distinguish a correct regex router from a naive
one:

  * catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS): a backtracking NFA engine can take time
    exponential in the input on adversarial patterns. The defence is to run a
    DETERMINISTIC automaton — one transition per input character, no backtrack —
    so match time is LINEAR in the path length regardless of the pattern.
  * unanchored matching: substring semantics let `^/api$` also fire on
    `/api/secret`, a route-confusion / auth-bypass hazard. The defence is to
    ANCHOR — acceptance requires the automaton to consume the ENTIRE path and
    land in an accepting state; a proper prefix or a longer extension does not
    match.

This file models the matcher as a DFA over `Char` and proves both defences, plus
the dispatch contract shared with `Route.Match`: among the routes whose anchored
matcher accepts the path, the most-specific (highest `spec`) wins, ties broken by
earliest table index — and the chosen route is one the table declares.

Theorems:
  * `regex_route_no_catastrophic` — the matcher performs EXACTLY `path.length`
    transitions: linear, no backtracking, no ReDoS (bounded independent of the
    automaton / pattern).
  * `regex_route_anchored` — the exact-string matcher accepts a path IFF the path
    equals the pattern in full: no proper-prefix and no proper-extension false
    match (anchored at both ends).
  * `regex_route_matches` — `bestRegex` selects a route whose matcher accepts the
    path, that the table declares, and than which no matching route is more
    specific (longest/most-specific wins; earliest index on ties).

Everything is a leaf model: it imports only the Lean core and depends on no other
project module, so it verifies in isolation.

/-! ## A deterministic finite automaton over `Char`

State type `σ` is a parameter: the compiled matcher chooses its own state
encoding (a `Nat` index, a residual-language value, …). The three theorems hold
for every `σ`. -/

/-- A DFA: a start state, a total accepting predicate, and a total transition. -/
structure DFA (σ : Type) where
  start : σ
  accept : σ → Bool
  step : σ → Char → σ

variable {σ : Type}

/-- Run the automaton from state `s`, consuming the input left to right. Each
input character advances the state exactly once — there is no backtracking. -/
def DFA.runFrom (d : DFA σ) (s : σ) : List Char → σ
  | [] => s
  | c :: cs => d.runFrom (d.step s c) cs

/-- Run from the start state. -/
def DFA.run (d : DFA σ) (input : List Char) : σ := d.runFrom d.start input

/-- Anchored acceptance: the WHOLE input is consumed and the final state accepts.
There is no substring / prefix acceptance — the run must cover every character. -/
def DFA.accepts (d : DFA σ) (input : List Char) : Bool := d.accept (d.run input)

/-- The number of transitions taken by a run from `s`: one per input character. -/
def DFA.runSteps (d : DFA σ) (s : σ) : List Char → Nat
  | [] => 0
  | c :: cs => 1 + d.runSteps (d.step s c) cs

/-! ## No catastrophic backtracking (linearity)

A run takes exactly one transition per input character — the work is `O(len)`,
independent of the automaton and hence of the source pattern. This is the formal
content of "the matcher is a DFA / proven-bounded": no exponential blow-up, no
ReDoS. -/

/-- The transition count of a run from any state equals the input length. -/

  | nil => rfl
  | cons c cs ih =>
    simp [DFA.runSteps, List.length_cons, ih (d.step s c), Nat.add_comm]

/-- **No catastrophic backtracking.** Matching a path against a DFA route runs in
time LINEAR in the path length — exactly `path.length` transitions, bounded
independently of the pattern. A backtracking engine has no such bound; a DFA does
by construction. -/

    d.runSteps d.start path = path.length :=
  runSteps_eq_length d d.start path

/-! ## Anchored exact-string matcher

`strDFA w` is the compiled automaton for the anchored literal pattern `^w$`. Its
state is the remaining expected suffix (`some rem`), or a dead sink (`none`). It
accepts only when the entire input has been matched (`some []`); a mismatch or a
surplus character sinks to `none` forever. -/

/-- The anchored automaton for the literal string `w`. -/
def strDFA (w : List Char) : DFA (Option (List Char)) where
  start := some w
  accept := fun s => match s with
    | some [] => true

  step := fun s c => match s with
    | some (e :: rest) => if e == c then some rest else none
    | some []          => none   -- full match already consumed; a surplus char sinks
    | none             => none   -- dead sink is absorbing

/-! Transition/accept equations for `strDFA`, proven by definitional unfolding so
later proofs never expose the raw structure literal. -/

`w` and on nothing else. -/

/-! ## Longest / most-specific dispatch

A regex route table is `List (RegexRoute σ H)`. `bestRegex` selects, among the
routes whose anchored matcher accepts the path, the one with the greatest `spec`
(specificity), breaking ties toward the earliest table index — mirroring
`Route.Match.bestMatch`'s class-precedence + least-index discipline. -/
