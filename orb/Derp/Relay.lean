# DERP relay-forwarding server — the proven forwarding state machine

The `Derp` module models the DERP wire framing and the login handshake (both
directions) as a *client* would drive it. This module adds the missing half: the
**relay server** — the transition system a relay runs to accept many client
connections and forward encrypted packet frames *between* them, peer to peer,
without ever decrypting the payload it carries.

A relay is a pure router. Each connection, after its login handshake, announces
its own Curve25519 public key (the relay learns it by opening the client's
`FrameClientInfo`); the relay records `key → connection` in a routing table. When
a connection `A` sends a `FrameSendPacket` addressed to a destination public key
`B`, the relay looks `B` up in the table and re-frames the *verbatim* payload as a
`FrameRecvPacket` stamped with `A`'s source key, delivering it to `B`'s connection
and to no other. If `B` is not connected, the frame is dropped — never broadcast,
never misrouted. The relay is *blind*: the packet bytes pass through unchanged; it
routes on the addressing envelope alone.

This is the DERP analogue of a switch's forwarding table, and the security
properties below are the switch's forwarding discipline made precise.

## The state

* `RelayState` — the routing table, a list of `(peerKey, connId)` registrations.
  A key is bound to at most one connection (re-registration replaces the prior
  binding); `connOf` reads `key → conn` for the *destination* lookup and `keyOf`
  reads `conn → key` for stamping the *source* on a forwarded frame.

## The step relation

* `Event` — what a relay reacts to: a connection registering its key
  (`clientInfo`), a `sendPacket` addressed to a peer key, and a departure
  (`peerGone`). `step` folds an event into `(state', deliveries)` where a
  `Delivery` names the exact destination connection and the exact frame put on it.

## The forwarding discipline (proven, 0 sorries)

* `forward_to_addressed_only` — a `SendPacket` for `dstKey` is delivered ONLY to
  the connection registered for `dstKey`; every delivery it produces targets that
  one connection, never any other, never a broadcast.
* `relay_blind` — the relay forwards the payload bytes UNCHANGED: the delivered
  `RecvPacket` payload splits back into the source key and the *identical* packet
  the sender supplied. The relay does not read, decrypt, or alter the packet.
* `absent_dst_dropped` — a packet addressed to an unregistered peer produces no
  delivery and leaves the table unchanged: dropped, not misrouted.
* `unregistered_src_dropped` — a connection that has not registered its key
  cannot inject a forwarded frame; the relay stamps a genuine source or drops.
* `delivery_dst_registered` — registration soundness: any connection that
  RECEIVES a forwarded frame is one that had registered a key first.
* `register_binds` / `register_rebinds` — the table honors a fresh registration
  and a re-registration replaces the old binding.

## Boundary / follow-on

* The **mesh** — multiple relays gossiping presence with `peerPresent` /
  `peerGone` / `watchConns` broadcasts across a relay fabric — is named
  follow-on. This module proves the *single-relay* peer-to-peer forwarding, which
  is the core discipline; the mesh layers presence propagation on top of it and
  reuses the same routing table and the same blind-forward invariant per hop.
