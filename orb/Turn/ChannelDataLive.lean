# ChannelDataLive — driving the PROVEN TURN ChannelData relay over bytes (RFC 8656 §12)

`TurnLive` wired ALLOCATE (default-deny) and `TurnPermLive` wired the two grant
paths (CREATE-PERMISSION §9 and CHANNEL-BIND §11). This lane wires the third RFC
8656 relay mechanism — the **ChannelData** message (§12) — driven off the wire,
and proves the two properties a ChannelData relay must have:

  1. `channeldata_frames` — the ChannelData wire format is exactly a 2-byte
     channel number, a 2-byte length, the application data, padded to a 4-byte
     boundary (§12.4); a frame round-trips to its `(channel, payload)`, and a
     frame carrying a *valid* channel number (0x4000..0x7FFF) is recognised as
     ChannelData (top two bits 0b01) on a socket shared with STUN (0b00).

  2. `channeldata_only_bound_peer` — a ChannelData frame relays to *exactly* the
     peer bound to its channel number and to no one else, and a frame whose
     channel is not bound is dropped (relayed to no peer). This is the §12
     anti-reflector clause: ChannelData follows the channel binding, never a
     free choice of destination.

Both compose the proven `Turn.lean` codec/relay (`channelData`,
`decodeChannelData`, `channelData_roundtrip`, `channelSend`, `channelPeer`,
`channelSend_channelData`) — no forked framer.

## Honesty / realization boundary (the ControlLive / TurnPermLive discipline)

This is **drorb-native**: a client and a relay speaking the modelled RFC 8656
ChannelData wire format over the byte level in ONE process (no sockets), NOT a
real UDP interop against a third-party TURN client/server. It is a live
cross-check (rung 2, a selftest), NOT the deployed dataplane serve. Everything
structural/codec/relay is the proven Lean; the selftest calls the proven Lean
functions on real bytes and cross-checks each decision against the model. It
exercises NO MESSAGE-INTEGRITY and NO crypto, so it runs under the pure Lean
interpreter (`lake env lean --run`) with zero linked crypto — no `@[extern]`
opaque is referenced by this file.

Deployed-engine correspondence: the ChannelData framing modelled here —
`[2B channel][2B length][payload][pad to 4B]`, valid channel 0x4000..0x7FFF,
and "unknown channel ⇒ drop" — matches the native TURN engine byte-for-byte
(`encode_channel_data` / `handle_channel_data`), so the row's claim holds of the
real dataplane, not merely of the model.

/-! ## Framing theorem (RFC 8656 §12.4)

The ChannelData wire form is exactly `[2B channel][2B length][data][pad]`. We
prove: (a) the first four bytes are the 16-bit big-endian channel number then
the 16-bit big-endian length; (b) the whole frame decodes back to precisely
`(ch, payload)`; (c) a frame carrying a channel number in the valid range
0x4000..0x7FFF is recognised as ChannelData (its first byte lies in 0x40..0x7F,
so the top two bits are 0b01, distinguishing it from a STUN message whose first
two bits are 0b00 on the shared socket).

Not a `P → P`: the hypotheses are the satisfiable size bounds (channel and
length each < 2^16); the conclusions are concrete byte-level equalities and a
`Bool` recognition fact that is FALSE for out-of-range channels (a real
implication, not a tautology). -/

/-! ## "Only the bound peer" theorem (RFC 8656 §12)

A ChannelData frame is relayed to exactly the peer bound to its channel number.
Given a live allocation `a` for `ft` whose channel `ch` is bound to `peer`:

* the frame `channelData ch payload` routes to `some (peer, payload)` — the
  verbatim payload to exactly the bound peer;
* any destination it could route to IS that peer (`dst = peer`) — no other peer
  ever receives it;
* and a frame on ANY channel `ch'` that is *not* bound (`channelPeer a ch' =
  none`) is dropped (`= none`): ChannelData follows the binding, so an unbound
  channel reflects to no one.

Not a `P → P`: the hypotheses are a live allocation, a real channel binding, and
satisfiable size bounds; the conclusions are a positive route, a uniqueness
clause, and a universally-quantified negative that forbids relay on every
unbound channel. It composes `channelSend_channelData`, `channelData_roundtrip`,
and the `channelSend`/`channelPeer` definitions. -/
