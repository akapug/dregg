# AllocRefreshLive — driving the PROVEN TURN allocation Refresh over bytes (RFC 8656 §7/§8)

`TurnLive` wired ALLOCATE (default-deny), `TurnPermLive` wired the two grant paths
(CREATE-PERMISSION §9 / CHANNEL-BIND §11), and `ChannelDataLive` wired the
ChannelData relay (§12). This lane wires the allocation **Refresh** transition
(RFC 8656 §7, message layout §8): the client periodically re-asserts an
allocation, and the server's LIFETIME response decides its fate —

  * a **positive** lifetime *extends* the allocation, moving its absolute expiry
    forward to `now + lifetime` while leaving every permission and channel
    binding untouched (§7.1: a refresh changes only the timer);
  * a **zero** lifetime *deletes* the allocation (§7: "a Refresh request with a
    REQUESTED-LIFETIME of 0 … is used to delete an allocation").

and proves the two properties a Refresh must have:

  1. `refresh_extends` — refreshing a live allocation with a positive lifetime
     re-binds it with `expiry = now + lifetime`, the refreshed allocation is
     `active` at `now` (it has been pushed into the future), and its relayed
     address / permissions / channel bindings are carried over verbatim (a
     refresh is not a re-allocation — it does not reset the grant state).

  2. `refresh_zero_deletes` — refreshing with lifetime 0 removes the allocation:
     a subsequent lookup finds nothing and it is not `active`. This is the §7
     teardown clause; it is what `deallocate` (Refresh, LIFETIME=0) relies on.

Both compose the proven `Turn.lean` state machine (`refresh`, `allocate`,
`createPermission`, `channelBind`, `active`, `TurnState.lookup/insert/remove`,
`lookup_insert`) — no forked transition. The selftest additionally drives the
lifetime **off the wire**: it builds the proven `refreshRequestMsg`, parses it
with the proven STUN `parse`, recovers the LIFETIME attribute, and feeds that
recovered value into the model `refresh` — so the number that decides
extend-vs-delete is the one carried by the RFC 8656 §8 byte layout, not a
side-channel.

## Honesty / realization boundary (the ChannelDataLive / TurnPermLive discipline)

This is **drorb-native**: a client and a relay speaking the modelled RFC 8656
Refresh wire format over the byte level in ONE process (no sockets), NOT a real
UDP interop against a third-party TURN server, and NOT the deployed HTTP
dataplane — TURN is a UDP relay method with no curl-able HTTP surface, so there
is no deployed endpoint to GET (a real boundary, stated: the drorb serve does
not emit TURN refresh over HTTP; the correspondence is byte-level). It is a live
cross-check (rung 2, a selftest), NOT the deployed serve. Everything
structural/codec/transition is the proven Lean; the selftest calls the proven
Lean functions on real bytes and cross-checks each decision against the model.
It exercises NO MESSAGE-INTEGRITY and NO crypto, so it runs under the pure Lean
interpreter (`lake env lean --run`) with zero linked crypto — no `@[extern]`
opaque is referenced by this file.

Deployed-engine correspondence: the extend-vs-delete decision modelled here — a
positive LIFETIME re-arms the expiry timer and preserves the grant state, a
LIFETIME of 0 tears the allocation down — matches the native TURN engine's
`refresh` / `deallocate` (deallocate = REFRESH carrying `LifeTime::new(0)`), so
the row's claim holds of the real relay logic, not merely of the model.

/-! ## A `remove` lookup lemma

`Turn.lean` proves `lookup_insert` but not the dual for `remove`; the deletion
half of Refresh needs it. Looking up a 5-tuple in `s.remove ft` is always
`none`: `remove` filters out every entry whose key `= ft`, so `find?` for a
key `= ft` matches nothing. -/
theorem lookup_remove (s : TurnState) (ft : FiveTuple) :
    (s.remove ft).lookup ft = none := by
  simp only [TurnState.remove, TurnState.lookup, Option.map_eq_none']
  rw [List.find?_eq_none]
  intro x hx
  have hfilt : decide (x.1 ≠ ft) = true := (List.mem_filter.mp hx).2
  simp only [ne_eq, decide_not, Bool.not_eq_true', decide_eq_false_iff_not] at hfilt
  simp only [decide_eq_true_eq]

/-! ## Theorem 1 — a positive-lifetime Refresh extends the allocation (§7.1)

Given a live allocation `a` for `ft` and a positive `lifetime`, `refresh`:

* re-binds `ft` to `{ a with expiry := now + lifetime }` (only the timer moves);
* leaves that allocation `active` at `now` (its new expiry is strictly in the
  future because `lifetime > 0`);
* preserves the relayed address, the permission set, and the channel bindings —
  a refresh is not a re-allocation, so the default-deny grant state survives.

Not a `P → P`: the hypotheses are a real live allocation (`lookup ft = some a`)
and a satisfiable positivity bound (`0 < lifetime`); the conclusions are a
concrete re-binding, an `active` fact that is FALSE for `lifetime = 0`, and a
verbatim carry-over of the grant fields. It composes `lookup_insert` and the
`refresh` / `active` definitions. -/

/-! ## Theorem 2 — a zero-lifetime Refresh deletes the allocation (§7)

Refreshing a live allocation with `lifetime = 0` removes it: the subsequent
lookup is `none` and it is not `active`. This is the RFC 8656 §7 teardown clause
(a Refresh with LIFETIME 0 deletes the allocation), the semantics the client's
`deallocate` relies on.

Not a `P → P`: the hypothesis is a real live allocation; the conclusion is that
after a zero-lifetime refresh the allocation is GONE — the opposite of
`refresh_extends`. It composes `lookup_remove` and the `refresh` / `active`
definitions. -/
