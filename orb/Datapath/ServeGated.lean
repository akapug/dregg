# Datapath.ServeGated — the CONTENT-TYPE-GATED serve: the common case is a ZERO-COPY
body passthrough (the pipeline RE-SHAPED so a non-HTML body is never tokenized).

`Datapath.ServeDenseFull` (`DRORB_SPAN=10/11/12`) runs the deployed html-rewrite body
transform on EVERY response body — it tokenizes the whole body unconditionally, which
is the deployed pipeline's shape (`htmlrewriteStage.onResponse` has NO content-type
check) and its inherent body-path ceiling. That is ALSO a latent correctness bug: it
tag-strips JSON / binary / octet-stream bodies (a `<` in the payload is deleted).

This module RE-SHAPES the body path. `serveGated` reads the response's declared
`Content-Type` (mirrored from the request, an echo server) and:

* on `text/html` — runs the DENSE deployed body transform (`rewriteBytesDense`), the
  same bytes `DRORB_SPAN=10` computes (the gate FIRES, exactly like deployed on HTML);
* on ANYTHING ELSE (the COMMON case) — the body flows as the borrowed `ByteArray`
  (`input`) STRAIGHT to the flat egress `serializeFlatB`, **never tokenized, never
  consed**. A pure zero-copy passthrough.

So the common case (`application/json`, `application/octet-stream`, images) is a
zero-copy body echo: parse index-native ⟶ dense header fold ⟶ body-as-borrowed-
`ByteArray` ⟶ flat egress. The body never enters the tokenizer, so this path is NOT
capped by the ~2.35× tokenizer ceiling — it approaches the zero-copy body-echo speed.

## What is proven

* `serveGated_refines` — `serveGated` is byte-identical to its own `List` twin
  `serveGatedList` for EVERY input (the dense-vs-`List` A/B: `DRORB_SPAN=13` vs `=14`
  serve NO differing byte). The `List` appears only on the SPEC side of each
  refinement (`parseIndexNative_refines`, `hdrFold_refines`, `serializeFlatB_refines`,
  `rewriteBytesDense_refines`); the compute path is dense.
* `serveGated_body_is_gate` — the served body IS exactly
  `(Datapath.BodyGate.gatedHtmlrewrite (declaredResp …)).body`: the serve genuinely
  realises the proven content-type gate (not an ad-hoc `if`).

The CORRECTNESS improvement over the deployed serve — a non-HTML body's `<`/`>` are
PRESERVED where the deployed `serveDenseFullList` strips them — is a concrete
kernel-checked `#guard` at the bottom.

★ HONEST SCOPE: like `ServeDense`/`ServeDenseFull`, this is a THREE-header-stage echo
serve whose body transform is the real deployed `rewriteBytes` — now content-type-
GATED. On a non-HTML body it is DELIBERATELY NOT byte-identical to the deployed
unconditional serve: it does not corrupt the body. That is the point (ember: reshape
into a better shape). It IS byte-identical to the deployed body behaviour on HTML
bodies and on tagless bodies (where `rewriteBytes` is the identity, so gate-on = gate-
off = deployed).

/-! ## THE GATED SERVE — non-HTML body is a zero-copy passthrough -/

/-- **THE CONTENT-TYPE-GATED SERVE.** Parse the request off the borrowed window by
INDEX (`parseIndexNative`, no request cons), fold the three real header-transform
stages over the flat `HdrBlock`, then GATE the body on the response's declared
`Content-Type`:

* HTML — run the DENSE deployed body transform (`rewriteBytesDense input`), the same
  bytes the deployed `serveDenseFull` computes;
* NON-HTML (the COMMON case) — the body is the borrowed `ByteArray` `input` handed
  STRAIGHT to the flat egress (`serializeFlatB`, an `Array` append). It is NEVER
  tokenized and NEVER consed — a zero-copy passthrough.

NO `List` materialises on the compute path: grep the passthrough branch — the body
arg to `serializeFlatB` is `input` itself, no `.toList`, no `rewriteBytes`, no
`tokenize`. -/

GATE the body on the SAME `isHtmlReq` decision, but with the body as the deployed
`rewriteBytes input.data.toList` (HTML) or `input.data.toList` (passthrough), then

/-- **THE GATED-SERVE BYTE-IDENTITY.** For EVERY input, the gated dense serve and its
`List` twin produce the IDENTICAL response bytes. The parse halves agree by
`parseIndexNative_refines`. On a dispatchable request the gate decision `isHtmlReq r`
is computed identically on both sides, and each branch's egress agrees by `egress_eq`
— the HTML branch linking the dense body transform to the deployed `rewriteBytes`
(`rewriteBytesDense_refines`), the passthrough branch carrying `input`'s own byte
list (`rfl`). So swapping `DRORB_SPAN=13` (gated) for `=14` (`List` twin) changes no
served byte. -/
