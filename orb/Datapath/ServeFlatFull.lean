# Datapath.ServeFlatFull — the ASSEMBLED FULL flat serve over the REAL deployed
14-stage pipeline (all stages, real routing — NOT the echo exemplar), rendered
through the FLAT egress serializer, proven byte-identical to the DEPLOYED
`Dataplane.drorbServe`.

`Datapath.ServeFlat.serveFlatEcho` (the `DRORB_SPAN=1` exemplar) measured ~3.4× on
an 8 KB body — but it ECHOES the request as the body and runs only the flat
security-header stage; it is NOT what the deployed default serves (the deployed
default runs the full 14-stage `Reactor.Deploy.deployStagesFull2` fold and routes
to the real handler). Its byte-identity is to its OWN `List` twin, not to
`Dataplane.drorbServe`.

This module closes that gap on the axis that is provable in one additive pass: it
assembles a serve that

* runs the **REAL deployed 14-stage pipeline** (`Reactor.ServeArr.respOf`, the exact
  built `Reactor.Response` inside `servePipelineFull2` — all of jwt / basicauth /
  ipfilter / rate / cache / redirect / traversal / policy / headerRewrite / cors /
  gzip / htmlrewrite / securityheaders / header, the real route table + handler), so
  the served bytes are the ACTUAL deployed response, not an echo; and
* renders that built response through the **FLAT egress serializer**
  `Datapath.FlatBody.serializeFlatB` — the response header block is pushed/rendered
  on the flat `HdrBlock` (`Array`, no response-head `List` spine, K5) and the body is
  carried as a genuine `ByteArray` and bulk-appended (`++ fbody.data`, no
  `body.toArray`-of-a-cons, R3) — instead of the deployed path's
  `List`-`serialize` + `.toArray` round-trip.

`serveFlatFull_refines` proves it **byte-identical** to the deployed serve
(`deployedServeRef`, which `Dataplane.drorbServe` is definitionally — closed in
`Dataplane.serveFlatFull_eq_drorbServe`, where `drorbServe` is in scope). The
byte-identity holds for BOTH the h2c prior-knowledge fork and the HTTP/1.1 14-stage
fold, so `DRORB_SPAN=3` serves the SAME bytes as the deployed default on every real
request — the measurement is deployed-representative, not an echo.

## HONEST SCOPE — what is flat and what is NOT

The flatness this serve adds over the deployed `List` serve is the **EGRESS**: the
response header block (`HdrBlock`, `Array.push`/flat render) and the response body
(`ByteArray`, bulk append) never materialize the response-head `List` spine or the
`body.toArray`-of-a-cons the deployed `serialize`/`.toArray` build. This is exactly
the class of flattening `Reactor.ServeArr.serveArr` captures, reached here through
the `FlatHeaders`/`FlatBody` flat-block machinery.

What this serve does **NOT** flatten — pinned by byte-identity to the 14-stage
deployed serve, and named precisely:

* **The request cons (K1).** The deployed pipeline `servePipelineFull2` consumes
  `input.toList` (the reactor parse `deploySubs`, the correlation-id hash, the render
  all read the request `List`). Feeding it the index-native `parseIndexNative`
  (`Datapath.IndexParse`, no request cons) requires the whole decision pipeline to
  consume a `SpanBytes` — the root change (`Bytes := List UInt8`), the "catastrophic
  reprove". So `input.toList` remains on this path; `parseIndexNative` is NOT wired
  in (it would produce a byte-identical parse but the pipeline re-parses internally).

* **The internal per-stage `List` materializations.** `runPipeline` builds a
  `Reactor.Response` whose `headers : List` and `body : Bytes = List UInt8` fields are
  `List`-typed; the 14 stages fold over those `List`s. `serializeFlatB` flattens only
  the FINAL egress render of that built response, not the intermediate `List`s the
  fold threads. Removing those needs the fold itself re-expressed over
  `HdrBlock`/`ByteArray` end-to-end — the composition the individually-grounded flat
  stages (`FlatStage_*.lean`) are the pieces of, still to be chained into a fold equal
  to `servePipelineFull2` (a large multi-file proof, not this pass).

Consequently the MEASURED speed vs the deployed `List` serve is the egress-flattening
margin only — NOT the exemplar's 3.4× (the exemplar is fast because it SKIPS the
14-stage fold; a serve byte-identical to that fold cannot). This is the honest
deployed-representative number: the real 14-stage flat serve is byte-identical to the
deployed default and flat on egress; the pipeline-internal `List` cost is what a
genuinely-faster real flat serve must remove next (the root `Bytes`/`Response.body`
migration), which is a separate step.

append — no `body.toArray`-of-a-cons at egress). Byte-identical to the deployed serve

/-- **THE FULL FLAT-EGRESS BYTE-IDENTITY.** For EVERY input, the assembled full flat

HTTP/1.1 path the flat egress `serializeFlatB` of the REAL deployed built response
(`Reactor.ServeArr.respOf`, the full 14-stage fold) is byte-identical to
`ByteArray.mk (serialize thatResponse).toArray` — the exact bytes the deployed serve
emits (`servePipelineFull2 = serialize ∘ respOf`, `Reactor.ServeArr.respOf_serialize`)
— by `serializeFlatB_refines` (flat header block + flat `ByteArray` body =
`serialize`), the `HdrBlock.denote_ofList` / `Array.toList_toArray` denotation bridges,
and the `Array.toList_inj` `ByteArray`-equality closer. Non-vacuous: the served body is
the real routed response (a `GET /health` gives the deployed health body, an 8 KB
`POST /echo` the deployed echo body — the conclusion genuinely depends on the request
bytes AND the full pipeline's routing). NO deployed byte changes. -/
