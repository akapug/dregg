# Datapath.ServeDenseFullReal — the `/bulk` BODY, proven densely reproducible

This module proves the **body half** of "the full 14-stage dense serve = `drorbServe`
on `/bulk`": on the deployed `/bulk` (1 MiB) route the served response body is
`Reactor.App.bulkBody = List.replicate 1048576 0x61`, the two body-touching transform
stages leave it UNCHANGED, and it is reproducible as a genuine `ByteArray` with NO
per-byte `cons`.

## Why the `/bulk` body is left untouched by the fold (ground truth)

Evaluated on hbox, `Reactor.ServeArr.respOf ("GET /bulk HTTP/1.1…")` produces
`status 200`, a 7-header set, and a body of `1048576` copies of `0x61`. The two
stages that could rewrite a response body in `deployStagesFull2` are BOTH gated OFF
for `/bulk`:

* `Reactor.Stage.Gzip.gzipStage` compresses only when the REQUEST advertises
  `Accept-Encoding: … gzip …` (`Gzip.acceptsGzip`); a plain `GET /bulk` does not, so
  the stage is the identity on the body.
* `Reactor.Stage.HtmlRewrite.htmlrewriteStage` rewrites only when the RESPONSE
  declares `Content-Type: text/html` (`isHtmlCT`, `htmlrewriteStage_body`); the
  `/bulk` response carries no `Content-Type`, so it is the identity on the body — and
  EVEN IF it fired, `rewriteBytes bulkBody = bulkBody` (`rewriteBytes_bulkBody` below,
  the tagless body has nothing to strip).

The remaining response stages (`securityheaders`, `header`, `cors`, the deploy
`headerRewrite`) touch only headers. So the served `/bulk` body is exactly
`bulkBody`, reproducible densely.

## What is proven here vs. the named residual

* PROVEN (this file): `rewriteBytes_bulkBody` (the K2 whole-body html-rewrite is the
  identity on `/bulk`) and `bulkBodyDense_toList` (the dense `ByteArray` body denotes
  to `bulkBody`) — axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}, 0 `sorryAx`.

* RESIDUAL (named, NOT attempted here): the full byte-identity
  `serveDenseFullReal input = Dataplane.drorbServe input` for `/bulk`. Its blocker is
  NOT the body but the **input-dependent response HEAD**: the deployed `/bulk` headers
  include `x-corr` (the whole request rendered as dotted-decimal) and `x-upstream`
  (a hash of the request), stamped by the deploy `headerRewrite` (`deployProg`). Any
  RUNTIME-dense serve must reproduce that head WITHOUT calling `respOf` (which, being
  strict, would materialise the 1 MiB body it is trying to avoid), i.e. re-express the
  response-phase header fold over `deployStagesFull2` densely and prove it equal to the
  deployed fold. That is the "still-open multi-file `runPipeline` re-proof"
  (`Datapath.ServePolyFull` honest-scope, `Reactor.ServeArr` L37-46): byte-identity to
  `servePipelineFull2 input.toList` pins any total serve to FEEDING it `input.toList`,
  so the head cannot be produced densely without that re-proof.
