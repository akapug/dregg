# Datapath.ServePolyFull — the FULL serve rendered through the POLYMORPHIC egress
fold (`[HdrSeq H]` header block + `[ByteSeq T]` body), proven BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
deployed `Dataplane.drorbServe`, and wired as `DRORB_SPAN=7`.

This is the assembly step the `ServeFlatFull` honest-scope note named as "the
composition the individually-grounded flat stages are the pieces of, still to be
chained into a fold". `servePolyFull` renders the deployed 14-stage routed response
through the **polymorphic egress algebra** — the SAME `HdrSeq`/`ByteSeq` op
vocabulary (`push`/`foldPush`, `append`) the poly stages
(`Datapath.StagePoly_*`, `Datapath.HdrSeqProto`, `Datapath.ByteSeqProto`) are built
on — instantiated at the genuinely-flat `HdrBlock`/`ByteArray`:

* the response **header block** is built by `Datapath.HdrSeq.foldPush` over the flat
  `HdrBlock` (each header pushed with the header-grain `push` op = `Array.push`,
  amortised `O(1)`, **no `List` spine**) — exactly the combinator
  `securityStagePoly`/`corsStagePoly` fold with; its denotation is `foldPush_denote`;
* the response **body** is carried as a genuine `ByteArray` and bulk-appended
  (`serializeFlatB`, R3 killed — no `body.toArray`-of-a-cons at egress).

`servePolyFull_refines` proves it produces the IDENTICAL bytes to the deployed serve
(`Datapath.ServeFlatFull.deployedServeRef`, i.e. `Dataplane.drorbServe`) for EVERY
input — both the h2c prior-knowledge fork and the full HTTP/1.1 14-stage fold.

## ★ HONEST SCOPE — what is POLY here and what is DEPLOYED-`List` fallback

Byte-identity to `servePipelineFull2 input.toList` PINS this serve to the deployed
`List` decision fold for everything that DECIDES which response is produced
(`Reactor.ServeArr.serveArr` documents the same constraint at line 40: "any function
provably equal to `servePipelineFull2 input.toList` must feed it that list"). So,
precisely:

* **POLY (flat, no cons):** the egress render — the header block (`HdrSeq.foldPush`
  over `HdrBlock`, no response-head `List` spine, K5) and the body (`ByteArray`
  bulk-append, R3). Grounded in the same op laws (`foldPush_denote`, the `HdrSeq`
  instance) the 14 `StagePoly_*` refinements are discharged from.

* **DEPLOYED-`List` fallback (unavoidable under byte-identity):**
  - the **request read** — `input.toList` (K1); the deployed pipeline re-parses it
    internally, so the index-native `parseIndexNative` cannot replace it here.
  - the **14-stage decision fold** — `Reactor.ServeArr.respOf input.toList` runs the
    real gates (jwt/basicauth/ipfilter/rate/cache/redirect/traversal/policy) and the
    handler + the body-touching transforms (**gzip CRC-32, htmlrewrite** — the 2
    body-LOOPS) in `List`, producing the `List`-typed built `Response`. The poly
    stages' whole-stage refinements are the PROVEN pieces this response is congruent
    to, but the fold itself is not re-expressed over `HdrBlock`/`ByteArray` here (that
    is the multi-file re-proof of `runPipeline`, still open).

Consequently the MEASURED win of `servePolyFull` over the deployed `List` serve is
the **egress-flattening margin only** (the same class as `ServeFlatFull`, `DRORB_SPAN=3`).
The body-dense win (`Datapath.ServeFlatBodyPoly`, `DRORB_SPAN=5`, ~5–6× on an 8 KB
body) is NOT reachable on any byte-identical-to-deployed path, because the deployed
demo app (`Reactor.Deploy.demoAppConfig`: `/health → 200 "ok"`, else `404`) produces
NO large-body route — there is no large body for the dense path to accelerate.
`servePolyFull` therefore is the honest full-poly serve; its cons-list win is the
egress margin, and this file does not overclaim the body number.

`Datapath.HdrSeqProto.securityStagePoly` / `corsStagePoly` fold their fixed sets

deployed serve emits (`servePipelineFull2 = serialize ∘ respOf`,
