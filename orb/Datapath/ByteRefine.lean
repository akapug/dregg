# Datapath.ByteRefine — the flat (`Array UInt8` / `ByteArray`) instance of the
polymorphic refinement calculus, and a serve fragment DERIVED flat from it

`Datapath.Refinement` gives the general calculus (the `FlatRep` abstraction
relation, `RefinesFn`, and the functor law `RefinesFn.comp`). This module makes it
concrete on the flat wire representation and USES it to derive a flat serializer
*mechanically*, with the `List`-typed spec (`Reactor.serialize`) and every lane
untouched.

## The flat representation and the combinator lemmas (proven ONCE)

The genuinely-flat, lemma-friendly carrier is `Array UInt8` (the `SerializeFast`
accumulator type); the wire type `ByteArray` is `{ data : Array UInt8 }`, reached
by the refinement-preserving bridge `ByteArray.mk`. On `Array UInt8` we prove,
each ONCE:

* `refine_empty`      — `#[]` refines `[]`;
* `refine_ofList`     — `l.toArray` refines `l` (the abstraction relation for a
                        materialized literal — the leaf of every derivation);
* `refine_singleton`  — `#[b]` refines `[b]`;
* `refine_append`     — array `++` refines `List.++` (a `RefinesFn2`), and its
                        shared-right-operand specialization `refine_append_shared`
                        (the body-stays-shared trick, `RefinesFn2.right`);
* `refine_map`        — `Array.map f` refines `List.map f`;
* `refine_fold`       — the FOLD combinator: a flat accumulator fold
                        (`foldAppend`) refines `List` concatenation
                        (`flatMap`/`flatten`) — the `parseHeadersAcc` /
                        `renderHeadersAcc` pattern generalized.

## The derived flat serializer (the framework does the work)

`flatSerialize : Response → ByteArray` is built from these combinators — a fold
over the head fragments (`refine_fold`) with the body as the shared right operand
(`refine_append_shared`) — and `flatSerialize_refines` proves it refines
`Reactor.serialize` **for free**, by chaining the combinator lemmas +
compositionality. The one serialize-specific fact is the framing decomposition
`serializeWire = (head fragments).flatten ++ body` (the spec side); the flatness
is entirely the calculus's doing. This is MECHANICAL: the same recipe (express the
`List`-`++`/`fold` structure of any serve stage in the combinators, discharge by
the lemmas) refines the whole serve.

`foldAppend f acc xs` folds one flat append per element into the uniquely-owned
accumulator (`acc ++ f x`, amortized-`O(1)` push, no per-join cons-spine) — the
`parseHeadersAcc` / `renderHeadersAcc` / `serializeHeadAcc` pattern, generalized
and stated once. `refine_fold` proves it reads back exactly the accumulator's
denotation followed by the `List.flatMap` of the per-element denotations, so with
an empty accumulator it refines `List.flatten` of the mapped fragments. -/

`Array UInt8` is where the clean lemmas live; the deployed wire type is

the `ByteArray` the host actually sends. -/

/-! ## THE DERIVED FLAT SERIALIZER — obtained from the combinators, not hand-written

`Reactor.serialize resp = serializeWire (build resp)` expands to a `List.++` chain
`statusLine ++ crlf ++ renderHeaders (allHeaders) ++ crlf ++ crlf ++ body`. We
express that chain's structure as (i) a fixed list of head fragments concatenated
by `flatten`, then (ii) the body appended as the shared right operand. The flat
version is then `foldAppend` over the head fragments (`refine_fold`) `++` the body
(`refine_append_shared`), and its refinement follows by chaining those two
combinator lemmas — the framework does the work. -/

/-- The header block as a flat list of byte fragments (`headerLine`s separated by
`crlf`), mirroring `Reactor.renderHeaders`' structure. `renderHeaders_eq_flatten`
proves its `flatten` is exactly `renderHeaders`. -/
def headerFragments : List (Bytes × Bytes) → List Bytes
  | []      => []
  | [h]     => [Reactor.headerLine h]
  | h :: t  => Reactor.headerLine h :: Reactor.crlf :: headerFragments t

/-- `renderHeaders` is the `flatten` of its fragment list — the spec's
right-recursive `++` chain re-presented as a flat fragment list (so the flat fold
can consume it). -/

    ∀ hs : List (Bytes × Bytes), Reactor.renderHeaders hs = (headerFragments hs).flatten

    ++ [Reactor.crlf, Reactor.crlf]

  let w := Reactor.build resp
  ByteArray.mk (flatSerializeHead w ++ w.body.toArray)

/-- **THE DERIVED-FRAGMENT REFINEMENT — proven FOR FREE from the combinators.**
The flat serializer refines the deployed `List`-typed `Reactor.serialize`. The
proof is a MECHANICAL chain: the head refines `(wireHeadFragments w).flatten` by
the FOLD combinator (`foldAppend_toArray_refines`); the body refines itself
(`refine_ofList`); the two combine by the shared-right-operand append
(`refine_append_shared`, i.e. `refine_append.right`); the wire bridge
(`refine_mk`) lifts to `ByteArray`; and the spec side collapses by the single
framing lemma `serializeWire_eq`. No reasoning about serialize's internals — the
calculus supplies the flatness. Non-vacuous: `flatSerialize` computes the bytes by
a genuine flat fold, not `serialize`. -/

/-! ## GENERALIZATION — the seed's request-side `SpanBytes` refinement and the
whole-serve `RefinesServe` are instances of THIS polymorphic calculus

The datapath seed (`Datapath.Refine`, `Datapath.Serve`) proved a *point-wise*
refinement `Datapath.Refines a s := s.denote = a` on the borrowed request window
`SpanBytes`, and a serve-level `RefinesServe serveA serveC`. Both are instances of
the general `FlatRep`/`Refines` here: `SpanBytes` and `OutBuf` are `FlatRep`s, the
seed's `Refines` is definitionally this module's `Refines`, and `RefinesServe` is
exactly the point-wise `Refines (serveA s.denote) (serveC s out)`. So this
calculus *generalizes* the seed's bespoke bridges into a reusable combinator
algebra. -/

/-- The borrowed request window is a `FlatRep` (its `denote` is the seed's). -/
instance : FlatRep Datapath.SpanBytes where
  denote s := s.denote

/-- **The seed's request-side refinement IS this calculus's `Refines`.** The
`SpanBytes` refinement relation from `Datapath.Refine` is definitionally the
general `Refines` — the seed was already a point instance of the framework. -/
theorem span_refines_iff (a : List UInt8) (s : Datapath.SpanBytes) :
    Datapath.Refines a s ↔ Refines a s := Iff.rfl

/-- The borrowed output buffer is a `FlatRep` (its live window is the denotation). -/
instance : FlatRep Datapath.OutBuf where
  denote o := o.bytes

/-- **`RefinesServe` is the point-wise instance of this calculus.** The seed's
serve-level obligation `RefinesServe serveA serveC` is exactly: for every
well-formed request span, the concrete serve's output `OutBuf` `Refines` the
abstract serve applied to the span's denotation. The whole-serve refinement the
compiler descent targets — a flat `serveC` proven to refine the `List`-spec
`serveA` — is this `Refines` at the serve grain; the combinator calculus above is
how that flat `serveC` is *built* (stage by stage: each stage's `List` structure
mapped to the flat combinators, refined by the lemmas + `comp`). -/
theorem refinesServe_iff_pointwise (serveA : Datapath.ServeA) (serveC : Datapath.ServeC) :
    Datapath.RefinesServe serveA serveC
      ↔ ∀ (s : Datapath.SpanBytes) (out : Datapath.OutBuf),
          s.Wf → Refines (serveA s.denote) (serveC s out) := Iff.rfl

/-! ## The whole-serve derivation + compiler composition (roadmap, stated precisely)

**How the fragment generalizes to the whole serve.** `flatSerialize` above is the
response *serialize* stage derived flat by the calculus. The deployed serve
`servePipelineFull2 = serialize ∘ runPipeline ∘ parse` is a composition of stages;
each stage is a `List`-typed byte transform whose `++`/`fold`/`map` structure maps
to the flat combinators here, and `RefinesFn.comp` (the functor law) composes the
per-stage refinements into a whole-serve refinement `RefinesFn serveA flatServe`
**by construction** — the same mechanical recipe applied stage by stage, the List
spec and all 50 lanes untouched. The remaining combinators to instantiate for full
coverage (named as the roadmap): the request-`parse` map (already proven point-wise
as `Datapath.spanParseRequest_refines` — a `RefinesFn` instance on `SpanBytes`),
and the per-stage transforms (`Reactor.runPipeline`), each a `map`/`fold`/`append`
composite the calculus already covers.

**How it composes with the compiler.** The flat `flatServe : … → ByteArray`
derived here is precisely the flat `serveC` the compiler descent (C-series) targets:
`List` spec → (this refinement) → flat Lean serve → (verified `leanc`-free lower) →
flat silicon. `flatSerialize_refines` closes the FIRST link (List spec ⇒ flat Lean)
for the serialize stage with the spec unchanged; the compiler closes the second
(flat Lean ⇒ machine code). The point-wise `RefinesServe` seam
(`refinesServe_iff_pointwise`) is where the two meet: the flat serve this calculus
builds is the object the compiler compiles, and its refinement of the `List` spec is
this module's `Refines`. -/
