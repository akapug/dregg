//! **THE WHAT-LINKS-HERE CARD** — the cockpit's two-way-link panel, reborn as a deos-js card.
//!
//! Ted Nelson's grievance with the web was the **one-way link**: a forward link points OUT;
//! nothing points back, so "what links here" is unanswerable except by a crawler's guess. The
//! cockpit's what-links-here panel (see `starbridge-v2/src/links_here.rs`) renders the link
//! the OTHER way — *who transcludes / observes ME* — over the genuine [`Backlinks`]
//! witness-graph. But that panel is hardcoded Rust gpui: you cannot reshape it without a
//! rebuild and the agent cannot rewrite it. This module makes it a **deos-js card** — a cell
//! whose view is a *view-tree* ([`crate::card_editor::ViewTree`], the `{kind, props,
//! children}` shape [`deos-view`] renders) generated from the focused cell's verified
//! backlinks:
//!
//!   - a **header** ([`ViewTree::Text`]) naming the question + the focused cell's `dregg://`
//!     identity, and the viewer tier the graph is projected FOR (the link fog-of-war);
//!   - a **visible-of-total** row — how many backlinks the viewer sees of how many the
//!     god's-eye docuverse holds (so an omission is legible);
//!   - one **backlink row** ([`ViewTree::Text`]) per observer the viewer is cleared to see,
//!     each a verifiable fact `← <observer> transcludes <focus> · receipt <hash> · commitment
//!     <hash>` — never a dangling pointer.
//!
//! ## Everything here is the REAL witness-graph
//!
//! The graph is built by resolving GENUINE transclusions among the cells: each cell is
//! published as a `dregg://` page into one [`WebOfCells`], and each cell transcludes the NEXT
//! cell's finalized field through the real [`TranscludedField::include`] (content → commitment
//! → receipt → quorum) — a ring. Each resolved quote is recorded into a real [`Backlinks`] via
//! [`Backlinks::observe`], so the backlink of cell *N* is cell *N−1*, a verifiable fact, not a
//! fabricated edge. A forged or non-finalized quote could not be `include`d, so it could not be
//! recorded.
//!
//! ## Editable from within
//!
//! Because the view is *data*, it is **editable from within**: [`LinksCard::edit_view`]
//! patches the panel's OWN view-source — relabel the header, append a navigate button — as a
//! *receipted patch* with *blame*. The panel UI reshapes live; the edit is an accountable
//! patch, not a recompile. The cap tooth (the proven [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] gate)
//! refuses an unauthorized reshape in-band — no patch, no receipt.
