//! **Multi-cell agent turns** — hyperdreggmedia authoring surface #2
//! (`docs/deos/HYPERDREGGMEDIA-NOTES.md` §6).
//!
//! Today an [`Applet`](crate::Applet) authors ONE cell, and a
//! [`CardEditor`](crate::CardEditor) authors ONE card. This module lets the agent
//! (or a user) author a STORY that spans MULTIPLE cells in one coherent gesture —
//! mint a card, grant a cap to a peer, set a field on a third cell — each leg a real
//! cap-gated *verified turn*, the whole composition bounded by the author's `held`
//! authority. The unifying truth holds across cells: *every authoring gesture is an
//! affordance; every affordance is a turn; every turn is a receipt.*
//!
//! ## The cap tooth, generalised to multiple cells
//!
//! [`Applet::fire`](crate::Applet::fire) keeps the cap tooth by checking ONE
//! affordance's `required` against the driver's `held`, and binds the turn to the
//! applet's OWN cell (a fire cannot cross to another vessel). A multi-cell story has
//! TWO over-reach faces, and this module refuses BOTH in-band:
//!
//!   1. **authority over-reach** — a step whose `required` authority is NOT narrower-
//!      or-equal to the author's `held` ([`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`], the exact
//!      tooth `Applet::fire` uses). The author cannot author a step it lacks the cap
//!      level for.
//!   2. **scope over-reach** — a step that touches a cell OUTSIDE the author's
//!      capped scope (`held_cells`): a SetField on a foreign vessel's cell, a grant
//!      FROM a cell the author does not hold. The author's authority is bounded to a
//!      set of cells; a leg reaching past that set is refused.
//!
//! ## All-or-nothing: PRE-SCREEN atomic, then step-wise commit
//!
//! The executor IS atomic within ONE turn (a multi-action/multi-effect `Turn` rolls
//! back ALL effects on any action failure — `turn/src/executor/execute.rs`). So two
//! composition shapes are genuinely available:
//!
//!   * **one atomic turn** carrying every leg's effects → true all-or-nothing at the
//!     ledger; but a created cell defaults to `set_state: Signature` permissions
//!     (`cell::Permissions::default`), so a same-turn create+setField on the NEW cell
//!     would trip the cross-cell `set_state` gate under the unchecked embedded driver.
//!     Atomic-turn composition is therefore subtle to get right and is NOT what this
//!     module commits (flagged below).
//!   * **step-wise turns, atomically PRE-SCREENED** — what we do. EVERY leg is checked
//!     against `held` + scope BEFORE ANY turn commits ([`MultiCellAuthor::compose`]).
//!     An over-reaching leg ABORTS the whole composition in-band: NO turn for ANY leg,
//!     no partial commit of an unauthorized leg ([`ComposeError::OverReach`]). Only a
//!     fully-authorised story commits; then each leg lands as its OWN verified turn
//!     with its OWN receipt, all attributed to the author cell.
//!
//! This is the SAME `applet`/`attach` machinery — `is_attenuation` as the tooth,
//! `ActionBuilder`/`TurnBuilder` for each turn, `DreggEngine::execute_turn` for the
//! real receipt — not a parallel model. The single-custody embedded world seeds the
//! author's capped cells with [`open_permissions`]-shaped permissions (as
//! `Applet::mint` does), so the executor admits the author's writes and the cap tooth
//! lives HERE in deos-js.
