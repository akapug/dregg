//! **THE AGENT-ACTIVITY CARD** — the cockpit's ADOS agent-activity surface, reborn as a
//! deos-js card.
//!
//! An agent is an intricate LOOP — perceive, decide, act, repeat. dregg grounds the ONE seam
//! that matters: the agent's ACTIONS, at the tool-call/turn boundary, each a cap-gated,
//! receipted, conservation-checked verified turn. The cockpit's agent-activity surface (see
//! `starbridge-v2/src/agent.rs`) renders that grounded seam, but as hardcoded Rust gpui — you
//! cannot reshape it without a rebuild and the agent cannot rewrite it. This module makes the
//! agent-activity surface a **deos-js card** — a cell whose view is a *view-tree*
//! ([`crate::card_editor::ViewTree`], the `{kind, props, children}` shape [`deos-view`]
//! renders) generated from an agent cell's provable activity, read off the live ledger:
//!
//!   - **THE HELD MANDATE** — the agent's c-list (its attenuated reach): one labeled
//!     [`ViewTree::Text`] per capability edge (`→ <target> @<slot> · <rights>`, faceted /
//!     expiry annotated). This is "adoption IS attenuation" made legible: an agent is exactly
//!     as powerful as the mandate it holds — nothing ambient.
//!   - **THE CAP-GATED TURNS + RECEIPTS** — the agent's recent committed turns, each a
//!     [`ViewTree::Text`] (`@h<height> · <effect-kind> · receipt <hash>`), drawn from the
//!     card's own receipt tape (the executor's verdicts, never faked). A live
//!     [`ViewTree::Bind`] on [`AGENT_NONCE_SLOT`] shows the loop's on-ledger step count, so a
//!     new committed turn advances it in place.
//!
//! ## Editable from within
//!
//! Because the view is *data*, it is **editable from within**: [`AgentCard::edit_view`]
//! patches the card's OWN view-source — relabel the mandate section, append an action button
//! — as a *receipted patch* with *blame*. The activity UI reshapes live; the edit is an
//! accountable patch, not a recompile.
//!
//! ## The cap tooth is kept
//!
//! A view-edit (and the step-counter bump it leaves) is admitted only when `held` satisfies
//! the card's `edit_authority` ([`AgentCard::authorized`]) — the proven
//! [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] gate. An unauthorized reshape is refused in-band — no
//! patch, no receipt.
