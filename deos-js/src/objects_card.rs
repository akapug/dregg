//! **THE OBJECTS CARD** — the cockpit's OBJECTS surface (the live cell list/grid), reborn
//! as a deos-js card.
//!
//! Today the cockpit's objects surface is hardcoded Rust gpui: its UI is *compiled code*.
//! This module makes it a **deos-js card** — a cell whose view is a *view-tree*
//! ([`crate::card_editor::ViewTree`], the same `{kind, props, children}` shape
//! [`deos-view`] renders) generated from the live World's cell roster:
//!
//!   - the **objects section** — one row per cell on the ledger (id-sorted), each carrying
//!     the cell's short id + its live balance as a labeled [`ViewTree::Text`], plus an
//!     `inspect` [`ViewTree::Button`] (its click is the affordance the cockpit wires to
//!     focusing the inspector on that cell). The roster is a pure function of the live
//!     ledger ([`deos_reflect`] over [`dregg_cell::Ledger`]).
//!
//! Because the view is *data* (a view-tree = the card's `view_source` document), it is
//! **editable from within**: [`ObjectsCard::edit_view`] patches the objects card's OWN
//! view-source — relabel a header, add a filter button, append a note — as a *receipted
//! patch* with *blame*. The edit lands a real provenance receipt on the card's OWN cell's
//! chain (the same [`Applet`]-backed authorship turn the inspector card uses), so a reshape
//! is an accountable patch, not a recompile.
//!
//! ## The live World
//!
//! The objects card reflects over a PROVIDED ledger (the cockpit's real World, or an
//! embedded [`Applet`]'s single-cell world for the rung-1 tests) — the data is the live
//! roster, never a parallel copy. The card itself is one sovereign cell (its own [`Applet`]),
//! so an edit-from-within receipts on its chain exactly as the inspector card does.
//!
//! ## The cap tooth is kept
//!
//! A view-edit is admitted only when `held` satisfies the card's `edit_authority`
//! ([`ObjectsCard::authorized`], the proven [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] gate). An
//! unauthorized reshape is refused in-band — no patch, no receipt.
