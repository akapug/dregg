//! **Two principals co-drive ONE shared card** — the multiplayer-cards killer
//! primitive made tangible, end to end and `cargo test`-able.
//!
//! The membrane (`starbridge-v2::shared_fork`) already mints → carries → rehydrates a
//! cap-bounded fork of a world for a second principal; the card editor
//! ([`crate::card_editor`]) already turns inspection of a card into authoring (each
//! view edit a receipted patch on the card's `view_source` document); and the patch
//! core ([`dregg_doc`]) already merges two divergent document histories by **pushout**
//! — a conflict is a first-class [`dregg_doc::ConflictRegion`] antichain, never a
//! silent overwrite. This module is the smallest weld that PROVES those three meet on
//! one object: **a shared deos-js card two distinct principals each fork, each edit
//! (in their own view), then STITCH.**
//!
//! ## The loop
//!
//! 1. **One shared card.** [`SharedCard::seed`] builds a card (an [`Applet`] + its
//!    [`AppletManifest`]) whose `view_source` is a [`ViewTree`] — the same
//!    `{kind, props, children}` JSON a renderer paints.
//! 2. **Two forks.** Principal `A` and principal `B` each take a fork
//!    ([`SharedCard::fork_for`]) — a [`CardEditor`] over a clone of the card's view,
//!    bounded by that principal's own `held` authority (the cap tooth: a principal
//!    can only author a card it is authorized to). The two forks share a common
//!    prefix (the seed view) and then diverge.
//! 3. **Each drives its view.** `A` relabels a text node; `B` adds a button — each a
//!    real receipted patch on its OWN fork's `view_source` document
//!    ([`CardEditor::edit_view`]).
//! 4. **Stitch by pushout.** [`SharedCard::stitch`] folds the two forks' divergent
//!    `view_source` histories ([`crate::program_doc::ProgramSource::merge`], the
//!    `dregg_doc` pushout). A **clean** merge keeps BOTH edits; a **true conflict**
//!    (both principals edit the same node) surfaces as a [`dregg_doc::ConflictRegion`]
//!    — two live, attributed alternatives a reader resolves later, never a last-writer
//!    overwrite.
//!
//! gpui-free + `cargo test`-able: the card edits are real receipted patches through
//! the embedded executor, and the stitch is the genuine `dregg_doc` pushout — so the
//! tests prove two-principal co-drive without a GPU.
