//! **THE DYNAMICS-FEED CARD** — the cockpit's live dynamics feed, reborn as a deos-js card.
//!
//! Today the cockpit's dynamics feed (the scrolling stream of recent turns/receipts — see
//! `starbridge-v2/src/dynamics.rs`) is hardcoded Rust gpui: its UI is *compiled code*, so
//! you cannot reshape it without a rebuild and the agent cannot rewrite it. This module
//! makes the feed a **deos-js card** — a cell whose view is a *view-tree*
//! ([`crate::card_editor::ViewTree`], the same `{kind, props, children}` shape [`deos-view`]
//! renders) generated from the live stream of committed turns:
//!
//!   - a **header** ([`ViewTree::Text`]) naming the feed + how many entries it shows;
//!   - a **live entry-count** ([`ViewTree::Bind`]) bound to the card's `FEED_LEN_SLOT`, so a
//!     new turn that appends an entry advances the displayed count in place (the renderer
//!     re-reads it off the live ledger — a landed turn updates the row without a re-fold);
//!   - one **entry row** ([`ViewTree::Text`]) per recent transition, most-recent-LAST, each
//!     a legible `@h<height> · <effect-kind> · <author>` line (height, effect-kind, author —
//!     the same triple `WorldEvent` carries).
//!
//! ## The feed APPENDS on a new turn
//!
//! [`DynamicsCard::observe`] is how a new turn enters the feed: it pushes a [`FeedEntry`]
//! (height + effect-kind + author), fires a real `SetField` turn that bumps the card's
//! `FEED_LEN_SLOT` (so the bound entry-count row advances — the live binding the renderer
//! re-reads), and re-derives the entry rows. The card thus "scrolls" as the world commits
//! turns: each observed transition is one more row, the newest at the bottom, the bound
//! length tracking the stream.
//!
//! ## Editable from within
//!
//! Because the view is *data* (a view-tree = the card's `view_source` document), it is
//! **editable from within**: [`DynamicsCard::edit_view`] patches the feed card's OWN
//! view-source — relabel the header, append a filter button — as a *receipted patch* with
//! *blame*. The feed UI reshapes live; the edit is an accountable patch, not a recompile.
//!
//! ## The cap tooth is kept
//!
//! Both teeth are the proven [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] gate: an observe (which bumps a
//! field via a real turn) and a view-edit are admitted only when `held` satisfies the card's
//! `edit_authority` ([`DynamicsCard::authorized`]). An unauthorized reshape is refused
//! in-band — no patch, no receipt.
