//! THE WHAT-LINKS-HERE CARD, PROVEN BY RUNNING — the cockpit's two-way-link panel reborn as a
//! deos-js card, whose view is GENERATED from the focused cell's verified backlinks (the real
//! `Backlinks` witness-graph), projected per-viewer (the link fog-of-war), and EDITABLE FROM
//! WITHIN.
//!
//! The chain proven here:
//!   (a) OPEN → the panel's view-tree carries the question + the focus's dregg:// identity, a
//!       live-bound visible-count row, a visible-of-total row, and one cited backlink row per
//!       observer the viewer is cleared to see.
//!   (b) FOG-OF-WAR → an incomparable (Signature) viewer sees STRICTLY FEWER backlinks than a
//!       root (None) viewer; the god's-eye total is the SAME, only the projection differs.
//!   (c) EDIT FROM WITHIN → `edit_view` relabels the header on the panel's OWN view-source →
//!       the view changes, the edit a RECEIPTED PATCH attributed by BLAME.
