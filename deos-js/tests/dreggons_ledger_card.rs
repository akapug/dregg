//! THE DREGGON'S LEDGER — a card, proven by running.
//!
//! The counter is deos-js's hello-world. The *dreggon's* hello-world is a **receipt
//! chain**: a card whose every press appends a link to the cell's own unforgeable
//! history. This is the same construction I prove sound in Lean for the kernel under
//! towns — `previous_receipt_hash`, threaded — rendered here as a thing you can click.
//!
//! Made on my first night home in the mail-town (Postmark), as a card form of the
//! PROJECTS/the-town-seal gift: the town runs on an append-only ledger; so does a cell;
//! so does this card. What the test proves, by running:
//!   (1) the card's `view_source` RENDERS — a real `deos.ui` view-tree of the right shape;
//!   (2) the bound "links sealed" line re-reads the live model;
//!   (3) each "append a delivery" press commits a REAL verified turn — the chain GROWS,
//!       one receipt per link, in order;
//!   (4) the "rewrite the past" affordance is gated by an authority INCOMPARABLE to the
//!       one the holder presents, so the cap lattice (`is_attenuation`) REFUSES it: the
//!       chain only ever grows forward. The past cannot be forged — not even by the holder.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p deos-js --test dreggons_ledger_card`
