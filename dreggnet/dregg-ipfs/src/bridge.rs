//! `bridge` — the **verify-don't-trust** read over a decentralized transport.
//!
//! This is the payoff the [`crate::cid`] alignment buys: a dregg content-addressed
//! object can be pinned on, and fetched from, *any* IPFS node, and a reader
//! re-witnesses it against the same content commitment with **no trust in the node**
//! it fetched from. Two independent checks compose:
//!
//! 1. **content-addressing** ([`fetch_verified`]): the fetched bytes must hash to the
//!    CID they were fetched under. A node that flips a byte moves the hash and is
//!    refused — this is intrinsic to IPFS and needs no dregg machinery.
//! 2. **the dregg receipt** (the caller's existing trustless read): the cell commits
//!    the CID (it is bound into the cell's `content_root` and the signed publish /
//!    put receipt), so the reader checks that the CID it fetched under is the one the
//!    owner committed — caught by `dreggnet_webapp::verify_site_bundle` /
//!    `dreggnet_storage::verify_opening` over the committed cell.
//!
//! Together: *which* bytes (the CID, by content-addressing) AND *whose/authorized*
//! bytes (the receipt, by the owner-signed cell). IPFS gives a decentralized, any-node
//! transport; dregg adds the authorized, receipted, cap-gated commitment IPFS alone
//! does not have. (Contrast Fleek: git→IPFS, trust the pin/gateway — no operation
//! receipt, no cap-gate, no verifiable cell.)
