//! The production [`DnsResolver`]: real TXT / CNAME lookups over a live DNS client.
//!
//! Where [`MockDns`](crate::MockDns) is the deterministic test instance of the
//! [`DnsResolver`] trait seam, [`LiveDns`] is the instance that actually queries the
//! network — so a real domain owner who publishes the `_dregg-verify.<domain>` TXT
//! (or the `<domain>` CNAME) gets their [`DomainBinding`](crate::DomainBinding)
//! flipped to [`Verified`](crate::VerificationState::Verified) against *live* DNS.
//! It is the instance the production verify path uses; tests keep [`MockDns`].
//!
//! ## Sync trait over an async client
//!
//! The [`DnsResolver`] trait is synchronous (the bind → verify state machine and the
//! gateway routing are sync), while the underlying DNS client
//! ([`hickory_resolver`]) is async, and its `Resolver` is neither `Send` nor `Sync`
//! — its lookup futures cannot cross threads. So [`LiveDns`] **pins** one resolver +
//! a single-threaded Tokio runtime to one dedicated worker thread and talks to it
//! over channels: a trait call sends the name (a `Send` `String`) and blocks on the
//! reply (a `Send` `Vec<String>` / `Option<String>`). This is correct regardless of
//! the caller's context — it never calls `block_on` on a thread that already owns a
//! runtime, so it cannot panic with "cannot block the current thread from within a
//! runtime".
//!
//! ## Edge cases (the real-DNS realities)
//!
//! - **NXDOMAIN / no records / timeout** → an empty answer ([`Vec::new`] / [`None`]).
//!   The verify check reads "no proof", never an error, never a false-positive — an
//!   unreachable resolver leaves a binding [`Pending`](crate::VerificationState::Pending),
//!   it never mints a cert nor routes a byte.
//! - **Multiple TXT records** → all are returned; the verify check accepts iff *any*
//!   carries the nonce. A single multi-segment TXT record's character-strings are
//!   concatenated (the canonical TXT value).
//! - **Stale negatives** → the resolver is configured to **not cache** (`cache_size =
//!   0`, zero negative TTL), so an owner who publishes the record and immediately
//!   re-verifies is not defeated by a cached "not found". Verify is on-demand; a
//!   fresh wire query each time is the correct trade.
