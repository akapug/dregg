//! # starbridge-nameservice
//!
//! Greenfield rebuild of the nameservice as a **starbridge-app**: a thin
//! library of `FactoryDescriptor`s plus turn-builder helpers that compose
//! dregg-native primitives only. No `Effect::RegisterName`, no
//! `Authorization::Unchecked`, no `[0u8; 64]` placeholder signatures, no
//! reaching past the framework into `dregg_turn::builder::*`.
//!
//! Companion docs:
//! - `../../../STARBRIDGE-APPS-PLAN.md` §3.1 ("nameservice — recommended
//!   first build") — the per-app design sketch this crate implements.
//! - `../../../SLOT-CAVEATS-DESIGN.md` — the design lane (Lane G) for
//!   slot-level caveats; the `register_name` flow below has a TODO on
//!   the `WriteOnce` constraint that lives there.
//! - `../../../APPS-AS-USERSPACE-AUDIT.md` §1.3 — the userspace audit
//!   that motivated rebuilding nameservice as dregg-native.
//!
//! ## What this crate exports
//!
//! 1. [`name_factory_descriptor`] — the `FactoryDescriptor` for
//!    per-name sovereign cells (rent + ownership state machine). Bakes
//!    in the write-once name-hash slot, the monotone-increasing expiry
//!    slot, the owner-authorization caveats, and a per-epoch creation
//!    budget to rate-limit Sybil registration.
//!
//! 2. [`FACTORY_DESCRIPTORS`] — a slice of all factory descriptors this
//!    starbridge-app contributes. The wasm runtime preloads these at
//!    startup so `window.dregg.createFromFactory(factory_vk, ..)` can
//!    resolve string VKs into real descriptors. (Today the slice has
//!    one entry; the dispute-resolution factory and the registry
//!    factory follow once Tier-2 paired escrow lands — see
//!    `STARBRIDGE-APPS-PLAN.md` §3.1 "Real version".)
//!
//! 3. [`build_register_action`] — turn-builder helper that takes an
//!    [`AppCipherclerk`] and produces a real signed
//!    [`Action`] recording a name registration via
//!    `Effect::SetField` + `Effect::EmitEvent`. No new Effect variant
//!    is introduced.
//!
//! 4. [`build_renew_action`] — advances the registry cell's
//!    `EXPIRY_SLOT` to a caller-supplied forward height and emits a
//!    `name-renewed` event. The universal `Monotonic(EXPIRY_SLOT)` caveat on
//!    [`name_cell_program`] enforces the expiry only moves forward (a rollback
//!    is refused).
//!
//! 5. [`build_transfer_action`] — the CURRENT owner re-points the
//!    owner-hash slot and stages the incoming owner's raw key; the
//!    handoff completes with [`build_accept_transfer_action`] (the
//!    incoming owner rotates the authority register to the staged key).
//!    The cell program's [`owner_authorization_constraints`] refuse
//!    both halves from anyone but the respective authorized signer.
//!    Capability handoff (`Effect::GrantCapability` /
//!    `Effect::RevokeCapability`) is the responsibility of the
//!    capability-broker turn that issues *with* this one — kept
//!    separate so this helper stays pure-state.
//!
//! ## The userspace stance
//!
//! "Register a name" is *userspace policy*, not a dregg primitive. The
//! ledger only needs to see:
//!
//! 1. **A name binding** — `SetField(NAME_HASH_SLOT, name_hash)` —
//!    anchoring the registration in cell state.
//! 2. **An owner binding** — `SetField(OWNER_HASH_SLOT, owner_hash)`.
//! 3. **An expiry binding** — `SetField(EXPIRY_SLOT, expiry_height)`.
//! 4. **An event for off-chain indexers** —
//!    `EmitEvent("name-registered", [name_hash, owner_hash])`.
//!
//! If we needed *cell-program-enforced uniqueness* ("the slot at
//! index `NAME_HASH_SLOT` may only be set if its prior value is
//! zero"), that's a **cell program caveat** (`WriteOnce`), not a new
//! `Effect` variant — see the TODO on [`build_register_action`].
//!
//! ## Compatibility with the in-browser DreggRuntime + extension cclerk
//!
//! `build_register_action` returns an [`Action`] carrying a real
//! `Authorization::Signature(..)` produced by the cclerk. That action
//! is what `cclerk::signTurn(turnSpec)` (the extension API
//! surface — see `../../../extension/src/page.ts`) expects to wrap in
//! a `Turn` for submission. The in-browser `DreggRuntime`
//! (`../../../wasm/src/runtime.rs`) executes the resulting turn
//! against the same `dregg_turn::TurnExecutor` code-path that native
//! CLIs use.

//
// `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: nameservice is THE web-of-cells
// keystone. Re-expressed as a composed [`DeosApp`] ([`name_app`] below) and mounted by
// `register(ctx)` (see [`register_deos`]): the framework wires per-viewer projection,
// the generated `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component, the manifest, the rehydratable
// frustum-snapshot — and, the headline here, **web-of-cells publish: each NAME cell is
// a real `dregg://` sturdyref**. That sturdyref is reacquirable across a federation
// membrane, so [`RESOLVE_TARGET_SLOT`] can point a name at a LIVE, reacquirable cell ref
// instead of an opaque `blake3(uri)` digest — the name directory becomes a web OF cells.
//
// **The seam is closed** — a TWO-TEMPO fire (mirror supply-chain-provenance /
// subscription). The three owner-only state-mutating operations (`renew`, `revoke`,
// `set_target`) are [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a live-state PRECONDITION; the FULL
// name program ([`name_cell_program`] = `WriteOnce(NAME_HASH)` · `Monotonic(EXPIRY)` ·
// `WriteOnce(REVOKED)`) is INSTALLED on the seeded name cell ([`seed_name`]) and
// RE-ENFORCED by the executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND —
//      nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this);
//   2. [`fire_renew`] / [`fire_revoke`] / [`fire_set_target`] then submit the FULL turn
//      derived from the cell's LIVE state, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the name program
//      — so a REWOUND expiry (`renew` that rolls the rent backward, `Monotonic(EXPIRY)`),
//      an UN-REVOKE (`REVOKED` 1 -> 0, `WriteOnce(REVOKED)`), and a name REBIND
//      (`WriteOnce(NAME_HASH)`) are all REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path —
//      the half the floor's `program.evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real
//      signed turn (see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).

// identity-issuer cell, may register names. The substrate primitive that
// enables this is `AuthorizedSet::CredentialSet` (cell/src/program.rs);
