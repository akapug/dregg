//! End-to-end teeth for the DISTINCT-COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE BOARD — a
//! governed-namespace cell whose committee votes live in the cell's
//! EXECUTOR-REACHABLE user-field MAP (`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md`'s
//! `fields_root`/`fields_map`, keys `>= STATE_SLOTS`) instead of the 16 fixed
//! register slots, driven through the REAL `EmbeddedExecutor`.
//!
//! This is the SECOND maxed-out governance app on the record-layer upgrade
//! (the first is `sdk/tests/polis_large_council_e2e.rs`). The base
//! governed-namespace folds its committee votes into ONE register slot
//! (`PENDING_PROPOSAL_ROOT_SLOT`, a rolling BLAKE3 chain) — legible, but NOT a
//! distinctness-enforced count, and a committee larger than three cannot keep
//! one approval bit per member in the fixed slots. Here a committee of **5
//! members past that cap** casts its votes as records at map keys
//! `>= STATE_SLOTS` (well past the 8th/16th field), and the route-table-swap
//! gate is the proven distinctness-enforced `MOfNDistinct` over the map
//! (`StateConstraint::FieldsCollectionAggregate`, reused verbatim from the
//! polis large-council keystone). Every safety property is enforced by the cell
//! program the executor re-evaluates on every touching turn — the negative
//! tests hand the executor a well-signed, well-formed turn and assert it
//! REJECTS.
//!
//! What is proven (both polarities):
//! * a 5-member, 3-of-5 committee with all votes in the MAP commits the
//!   route-table swap through the executor (5 votes cast as map records → swap
//!   the table + bump version → the quorum gate sees ≥ 3 distinct approvers),
//!   and the receipt's `post_state_hash` (which folds `fields_root`) binds the
//!   map-borne votes;
//! * a sub-quorum swap (2 distinct votes) is REJECTED by the executor (the
//!   dynamic-N quorum gate bites on the version-bump turn);
//! * a DUPLICATE-PADDED forge (one member's vote written under three map slots)
//!   is REJECTED — distinctness, not raw count, is load-bearing;
//! * ANTI-GHOST: tampering a 17th-field (map) vote flips the cell's canonical
//!   state commitment (the receipt binds the map, byte-for-byte) — and tampering
//!   a 9th+ committed field cannot be reused under the bound receipt.
