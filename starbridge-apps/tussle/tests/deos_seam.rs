//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native commit→reveal→resolve verbs fired through the executor
//! against the FULL figure program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so an ILLEGAL joint reveal is a REAL executor refusal in the
//! fire path, not a `program.evaluate`-only check. This file proves that seam CLOSED.
//! `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_figure` install [`figure_deos_program`] (the typed `sym`
//! enum tooth — `SymMemberOf` on every joint slot — CONJOINED with `Monotonic(PHASE_SLOT)`) on
//! the seeded figure cells, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//!      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate` — e.g. `PHASE == COMMIT`) decides the button's
//!      verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_commit_move`] / [`fire_reveal_move`] / [`fire_resolve_frame`]
//!      submit the FULL turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the figure program — so a
//!      `reveal_move` writing an ILLEGAL joint `sym` (a value outside
//!      `{Relax,Contract,Hold,Extend}`) is a REAL `SymMemberOf` executor refusal in the
//!      SUBMISSION path (msg "sym … not in enum set"), and a PHASE rewind is a real
//!      `Monotonic(PHASE)` refusal.
//!
//! **THE HEADLINE:** deos's hyperadvanced TYPED `sym` enum atom (`SymMemberOf`) bites a REAL
//! signed turn in the deos fire path — an out-of-enum joint value is refused by the EXECUTOR,
//! not by app bookkeeping. Plus the "set joints only on YOUR figure" cap tooth (a foreign-figure
//! fire is refused) and the phase gate. Every fire is a real verified turn; both gates are
//! genuine (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model.
