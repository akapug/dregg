//! # TUSSLE — a Toribash-style verified joint-combat match (Starbridge usecase app)
//!
//! Two **figures** fight by posing their **joints**. The delicious architecture pun: a figure's
//! joints are set in a **2-party joint turn**. TUSSLE is the forcing-function demo of deos's
//! hyperadvanced features — it COMPOSES the real primitives (the sealed commit, the typed `sym`
//! enum atoms, dregg cells, the verified per-asset executor) into a small, deterministic, verifiable
//! fighting game. There is NO toy combat engine: every guarantee is a real one the substrate
//! already enforces.
//!
//! ## The mapping (Toribash → deos)
//!
//! | Toribash                          | deos / dregg                                              |
//! |-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
//! | a fighter                         | a **figure** = a dregg **cell** ([`dregg_cell::CellState`])|
//! | a joint (knee, elbol, …)          | a **`sym` slot** of the figure cell                       |
//! | a joint state (Relax/Contract/…)  | a [`JointState`] enum case (a `Value.sym` identity)       |
//! | "you can't see my move yet"       | a **sealed commitment** ([`MoveCommit::seal`], fog-of-war)|
//! | both players lock in, then it runs| **commit → reveal → resolve** ([`Frame`])                 |
//! | the frame steps the physics       | a **deterministic resolution** = a cell-program           |
//! | the engine moves bodies + scores  | a **2-party joint turn**: score deltas folded through the |
//! |                                   | **verified executor** ([`dregg_intent::verified_settle`]) |
//!
//! ## What makes it verifiable (the three real primitives composed)
//!
//! 1. **The sealed commit (fog-of-war).** A move is a joint-state vector. Before the reveal, a
//!    player publishes only `seal(figure, joints, nonce) = BLAKE3(…)` — the SAME commit-reveal
//!    construction the sealed-auction app uses. The commitment HIDES the joints (the nonce blinds
//!    even the small joint-vector space) and BINDS the player to exactly one move: a peeker who
//!    changes their joints after seeing the opponent reveal hashes to a different seal that is not
//!    among the commitments, so the reveal is refused. The fog-of-war tooth
//!    ([`Frame::opponent_move_is_sealed`]) witnesses that the opponent's joints are unreadable from
//!    the sealed commitment alone.
//!
//! 2. **The joint-state-is-an-enum gate (the typed `sym` atom).** A joint slot's value must be one
//!    of the [`JointState`] enum cases — never an arbitrary scalar. That tooth is the freshly-landed
//!    typed atom [`dregg_cell::StateConstraint::SymMemberOf`] (the Rust image of the Lean
//!    `Pred.symMemberOf`, `metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/PredAlgebra.lean`), evaluated by the REAL
//!    [`dregg_cell::CellProgram::evaluate`] — the exact gate the executor runs every turn. A figure
//!    that tries to drive a joint to an out-of-enum value is REFUSED in-band ([`Figure::pose`]).
//!
//! 3. **The 2-party joint turn (the verified executor).** The deterministic resolution emits the
//!    contact **score deltas** as a balanced **ring of legs**, and folds them through the verified
//!    per-asset executor ([`dregg_intent::verified_settle::settle_ring_verified`], the Rust mirror
//!    of the Lean `Ring.settleRing`). The figures' score cells are the ledger accounts; the contact
//!    resolution is a deterministic function over the two revealed joint vectors, emitted as ring
//!    legs. When the host has installed the Lean intent gate (as a native node does at startup via
//!    `dregg-exec-lean::register_distributed_gates()`) each leg is ALSO cross-checked against the
//!    REAL Lean executor export, leg by leg; with no gate registered (this crate's own process,
//!    tests included) the fold is the in-process Rust mirror of the proven transition — no FFI
//!    cross-check runs.
//!
//! ## Cap ∧ state gating
//!
//! A player may set joints only on THEIR figure (the cap tooth) during THEIR commit phase (the
//! state tooth). The cap tooth is enforced by binding every [`MoveCommit`] to a `figure` cell id
//! and refusing a reveal whose commit was authored against the wrong figure
//! ([`Frame::reveal`] → [`TussleError::WrongFigure`]); the state tooth is the `Commit → Reveal →
//! Resolved` phase gate (a reveal before the commit phase closes is refused). This is the same
//! cap∧state conjunction the deos `GatedAffordance` (`app-framework`) models; here both teeth are
//! load-bearing and tested (`src/tests.rs`).

// =============================================================================
// The deos-native surface — the two FIGURES as a composed two-cell `DeosApp`.
// =============================================================================
//
// `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: TUSSLE re-expressed as a composed
// [`DeosApp`] — the interaction surface is ONE app with **TWO cells** (figure A and
// figure B), each carrying the commit→reveal→resolve verbs as affordances; the
// framework wires the rest (per-viewer projection, the web-of-cells publish — each
// figure is its own `dregg://` sturdyref —, the rehydratable snapshot, the generated
// `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component, and the manifest).
//
// ## Two figure cells, distinct CellIds (the two-cell subtlety)
//
// A `DeosApp`'s cells must have distinct [`CellId`]s. FIGURE A is the agent's OWN cell
// (`cipherclerk.cell_id()`) so fires execute against the seeded embedded ledger. FIGURE
// B is a distinct COMPANION cell, derived deterministically from the agent's pubkey
// under a fixed blinding token ([`figure_b_cell_id`]) and birthed into the SAME embedded
// ledger ([`seed_figure_b`] does `EmbeddedExecutor::ensure_cell` + grants the agent a
// cap reaching it, mirroring the privacy-voting companion-cell pattern). BOTH figures
// are seeded so the gated fires have live state — a fire whose target cell has no live
// state is fail-closed.
//
// ## The fire path is where the typed `sym` atom BITES (the headline)
//
// Each seeded figure cell carries [`figure_deos_program`] — the joint-state-enum
// `SymMemberOf` tooth on every joint slot PLUS a `Monotonic(PHASE_SLOT)` phase gate. The
// deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate` — e.g. `PHASE == COMMIT`) decides the
//      button's verdict IN-BAND — nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx
//      reactivity rides this);
//   2. [`fire_commit_move`] / [`fire_reveal_move`] / [`fire_resolve_frame`] then submit
//      the FULL turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the installed figure program — so a
//      `reveal_move` writing an ILLEGAL joint value (a `sym` outside
//      `{Relax,Contract,Hold,Extend}`) is a REAL `SymMemberOf` executor refusal in the
//      SUBMISSION path (msg "sym … not in enum set"), and a PHASE rewind is a real
//      `Monotonic(PHASE)` refusal. The typed `sym` atom — deos's hyperadvanced enum atom
//      — bites a real signed turn, not a side check (see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).
//
// The "set joints only on YOUR figure" cap tooth is TUSSLE's native ocap story: a
// fighter firing `commit_move` on a figure cell it does NOT hold a cap to is REFUSED
// (the cap-gate, or the executor's c-list authorization on a foreign cell).
