# starbridge-apps/

The successor to `apps/`. See `../STARBRIDGE-APPS-PLAN.md` for full
context.

A **starbridge-app** is a web surface that:

1. Loads `/pkg/dregg_wasm.js` (the in-browser node, see `../wasm/`) for
   local simulation / preview / time-travel.
2. Talks to `window.dregg` (the browser extension cclerk, see
   `../extension/`) for real identity, signing, capability brokerage,
   intent posting.
3. Optionally talks to a live federation node via the Studio's
   `RemoteRuntime` for production data.
4. Renders state via the Studio's URI-addressable inspector system
   (`<dregg-cell uri="dregg://cell/..." />`), the same components
   `site/src/starbridge.html` (the Playground / Explorer / Starbridge
   surfaces) uses.
5. Contributes **domain-specific inspectors and turn-builder presets**
   to the shared inspector registry under `shared/`.

A starbridge-app is *not* a separate stack. The wasm runtime is
generic — it knows about `Effect`, `Cell`, `Turn`, `Factory`,
`Authorization` — and a starbridge-app is mostly **data**: a set of
`FactoryDescriptor`s, a set of inspectors, a set of turn-builder
helpers.

## The userspace stance (the brief's hard rule)

> The answer is never `Effect::FooApp`.

When an app wants a domain Effect, the missing primitive is the
*generic* one (Caveat, StateConstraint, Authorization, Factory) it
would compose from. Every starbridge-app in this directory must be
buildable from dregg-native primitives only.

See `DREGG-FLAWS-FROM-APPS.md` and `APPS-AS-USERSPACE-AUDIT.md` for
the prior survey of which primitives are missing.

## App inventory (honest status)

Six apps are **real, fully-implemented** — each is a Rust crate
(`src/lib.rs` with `FactoryDescriptor`s + signed turn-builders), a
`pages/` web surface (inspectors + turn-builders + an `index.html`
fragment), a README, and a passing test suite. Their core flows run
end-to-end in-process against the framework's `EmbeddedExecutor` (the
canonical `TurnExecutor`), with the capability/mandate/slot-caveat gates
firing:

| App | Core flow (all gated, all tested) |
|---|---|
| `nameservice` | register → resolve / set-target → renew → transfer → revoke (WriteOnce / Monotonic slot caveats) |
| `identity` | issue credential → present (selective disclosure) → verify → revoke |
| `subscription` | grant publisher/consumer → publish → consume (bounded ring buffer) |
| `governed-namespace` | propose table update → vote (threshold) → commit → register service |
| `compartment-workflow-mandate` | init mandate → advance step (clearance-graph + spend-policy admission) |
| `storage-gateway-mandate` | init gateway → GET / PUT / LIST (volume-ceiling mandate) |

Four entries are **roadmap stubs**, not apps: `bounty-board`,
`compute-exchange`, `gallery`, `privacy-voting`. Each is a single
`manifest.json` with `"status": "unported"` and `"runtime_mode":
"legacy-http"`, pointing at its still-running legacy implementation under
`../apps/<name>/` (its `porting_target` is the starbridge-app to build).
They are deliberately *not* faked into half-working crates — porting one
follows the nameservice exemplar (the documented paint-by-numbers
template) and is tracked work, not shipped work.

### Anti-drift: generated JS constants

Every real app's web surface consumes a `pages/constants.generated.js`
rendered from the Rust source of truth (`web_constants()` in each
`src/lib.rs`, via `dregg_app_framework::ConstantsModule`). The pages
*import* slot indices / event topics / method names from it rather than
re-declaring the literals, so the JS can no longer drift from the slot
layout and event vocabulary the executor enforces. Regenerate with the
app's `constants_generator` example; a `constants_js_drift` test fails if
the committed file is stale. (This already caught and fixed a real bug:
governed-namespace's hand-written event topics never matched the
executor's emitted topics.)

## How a starbridge-app crate plugs in

Each Rust crate exports two things:

- A `FACTORY_DESCRIPTORS` slice (or per-factory constructors) baking
  the program VK + state constraints + capability templates the app
  needs. The wasm runtime preloads these at startup so
  `window.dregg.createFromFactory(factory_vk, ...)` can resolve the
  string into a real descriptor.
- Turn-builder helpers that take an `AppCipherclerk` (from
  `dregg-app-framework`) and produce signed `Action`s. No
  `Authorization::Unchecked`. No `[0u8; 64]` placeholder signatures.
  No reaching past the framework into `dregg_turn::builder::*`.

`dregg-app-framework::StarbridgeAppContext` (see plan §5.3) is the
host-side mount point. A host (`dregg-node`, a back-end aggregator
binary, or the wasm runtime in browser-only mode) calls
`app::register(&ctx)` to plug a starbridge-app crate into a running
federation. The app registers its factory descriptors, inspector
metadata, and turn-builder surface through that context; descriptor
constructors remain exported so tests and offline tooling can hash the
same source of truth directly.

## Workspace shape (Option A — single root workspace)

Each starbridge-app's `Cargo.toml` is a member of the root workspace
in `../Cargo.toml`. This shares deps and compile artifacts with the
dregg core. Per the plan §5.2, we'll only switch to a multi-workspace
shape if there's a concrete reason to (e.g. trimmer wasm-only deps).

## Dual-existence transition

The existing `apps/nameservice/`, `apps/identity/`, etc. crates stay
for now — Lane C just migrated them to use `AppCipherclerk` and they still
ship. `starbridge-apps/nameservice/` is the *new* canonical
implementation; the `apps/` ones will be retired once the
starbridge-apps version reaches parity. The dual-existence is
documented in the plan §2.
