//! # starbridge-bounty-board
//!
//! Greenfield rebuild of the legacy `apps/bounty-board/` HTTP app as a
//! dregg-native **starbridge-app**: a thin library of [`FactoryDescriptor`]s
//! plus signed turn-builder helpers that compose dregg primitives only
//! (`FactoryDescriptor` + `Effect::SetField` + `Effect::EmitEvent` +
//! `StateConstraint` slot caveats). No domain-specific bounty `Effect`, no
//! `Authorization::Unchecked`, no placeholder signatures.
//!
//! ## The bounty lifecycle is a substrate-enforced state machine
//!
//! A bounty is a single factory-born sovereign cell ([`bounty_factory_descriptor`])
//! whose slot caveats *are* the workflow rules — the executor rejects any turn
//! that would take the cell off its legal path:
//!
//! | Slot              | Meaning                          | Caveat            |
//! |-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
//! | [`TITLE_HASH_SLOT`]    | `blake3(title)`              | `WriteOnce`       |
//! | [`REWARD_SLOT`]        | escrowed reward amount       | `WriteOnce`       |
//! | [`STATE_SLOT`]         | lifecycle state code         | `StrictMonotonic` |
//! | [`CLAIMANT_HASH_SLOT`] | `blake3(claimant)`           | `WriteOnce`       |
//! | [`SUBMISSION_HASH_SLOT`]| `blake3(work artifact uri)` | `WriteOnce`       |
//!
//! The [`STATE_SLOT`] codes are [`STATE_OPEN`] (1) → [`STATE_CLAIMED`] (2) →
//! [`STATE_SUBMITTED`] (3) → [`STATE_PAID`] (4). Because the slot is
//! `StrictMonotonic`, the executor enforces that the state strictly increases:
//!
//! - You cannot skip backward (a paid bounty cannot be re-opened).
//! - You cannot re-enter a state (no double-claim into `CLAIMED`, because the
//!   second claim would write the *same* state code and `StrictMonotonic`
//!   requires `new > old`).
//! - Paired with [`CLAIMANT_HASH_SLOT`] being `WriteOnce`, the **first claimer
//!   wins**: once the claimant hash is bound, a competing claim cannot
//!   overwrite it to steal the bounty.
//!
//! The [`REWARD_SLOT`] is `WriteOnce`: the reward is set when the bounty is
//! posted (its first write, admitted from zero) and then frozen — it cannot be
//! silently lowered after a worker commits to the bounty.
//!
//! ## What this crate exports
//!
//! - [`bounty_factory_descriptor`] — the `FactoryDescriptor`, with its slot
//!   caveats baked into `state_constraints` so every born bounty cell inherits
//!   the gating.
//! - [`factory_descriptors`] — the descriptor slice for host registration.
//! - [`build_post_action`] — writes `TITLE_HASH`, `REWARD`, and `STATE=OPEN`,
//!   emits `bounty-posted`. Run against a freshly factory-born bounty cell.
//! - [`build_claim_action`] — binds `CLAIMANT_HASH` (write-once → first-claimer-
//!   wins) and advances `STATE=CLAIMED`, emits `bounty-claimed`.
//! - [`build_submit_action`] — binds `SUBMISSION_HASH` and advances
//!   `STATE=SUBMITTED`, emits `bounty-submitted`.
//! - [`build_payout_action`] — advances `STATE=PAID`, emits `bounty-paid`.
//! - [`register`] — mounts the app's factory + inspector on a
//!   [`StarbridgeAppContext`].

// =============================================================================
//
// `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the bounty-board, re-expressed as a
// composed deos app and PROMOTED into `src/`. The four-state gated lifecycle is ONE
// [`DeosApp`] ([`bounty_app`] below); the framework wires the rest — per-viewer
// projection, web-of-cells publish (the BOUNTY cell IS a `dregg://` sturdyref), the
// rehydratable frustum-snapshot, the generated `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component,
// and the manifest — none of which the floor's bones had. `register(ctx)` now mounts it
// (see [`register_deos`]).
//
// **The seam is closed** — a TWO-TEMPO fire. The three state-advancing lifecycle ops
// (`claim`, `submit`, `payout`) are [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a live-state
// PRECONDITION (the cell is in exactly the state this op advances FROM); the FULL bounty
// program ([`bounty_cell_program`] = title/reward/claimant/submission `WriteOnce` +
// `StrictMonotonic(STATE)`) is INSTALLED on the seeded bounty cell ([`seed_bounty`]) and
// RE-ENFORCED by the executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND —
//      nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this), so on a
//      POSTED bounty `claim` is LIT and `payout` is DARK, and the instant the cell
//      advances the lit/dark sets flip;
//   2. [`fire_claim`] / [`fire_submit`] / [`fire_payout`] then submit the FULL
//      multi-effect lifecycle turn (state-parameterized off the live cell), and the
//      executor RE-ENFORCES the installed bounty program — so a NO-ADVANCE / REWOUND
//      `STATE` (`StrictMonotonic(STATE)` requires strict `new > old`) and a CLAIMANT
//      OVERWRITE (`WriteOnce(CLAIMANT_HASH)`) are REAL executor refusals in the
//      SUBMISSION path — the half the floor's `program.evaluate`-only tests never
//      exercised through a real signed turn (see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).
//
// Both gates are the genuine ones (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). Because
// `STATE` is `StrictMonotonic` (strict `>`), a no-advance DOES bite (unlike `Monotonic`),
// so the lifecycle is a true one-way ratchet: each state can be entered exactly once.

///     (take an OPEN bounty) and `submit` (deliver work on a CLAIMED bounty) AND view;
///   - the POSTER (the bounty owner) holds [`AuthRequired::None`]/root — it can `payout`
