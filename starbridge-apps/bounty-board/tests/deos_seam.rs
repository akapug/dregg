//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `claim` / `submit` / `payout` fired through the
//! executor against the FULL bounty program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path
//! itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so an out-of-order / no-advance lifecycle turn is a REAL
//! executor refusal in the fire path, not a `program.evaluate`-only check. This file proves
//! that seam CLOSED. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_bounty` install
//! [`bounty_cell_program`] (title/reward/claimant/submission `WriteOnce` +
//! `StrictMonotonic(STATE)`) on the seeded bounty cell, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO
//! bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides
//!      the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost) — so on a
//!      POSTED bounty `claim` is LIT and `payout` is DARK, and the instant the cell advances
//!      the lit/dark sets flip;
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_claim`] / [`fire_submit`] / [`fire_payout`] submit the FULL
//!      multi-effect lifecycle turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full bounty program on
//!      the produced transition — so a NO-ADVANCE / REWOUND `STATE` (`StrictMonotonic(STATE)`
//!      requires strict `new > old`) and a CLAIMANT OVERWRITE (`WriteOnce(CLAIMANT_HASH)`)
//!      are REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the half the floor's
//!      `program.evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! Because `STATE` is `StrictMonotonic` (strict `>`), a no-advance DOES bite (unlike
//! `Monotonic`) — so the no-advance tooth is genuine, and the lifecycle is a one-way ratchet
//! (each state can be entered exactly once). Every fire is a real verified turn through the
//! embedded executor; both gates are genuine (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`).
//! No parallel model.
