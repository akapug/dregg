//! # subscription — the auto-drain CONSUMER as a `Reactor` (the reactive twin of
//! `invoke()`).
//!
//! The fifth axis (AX5) of a modern starbridge-app, and the FIRST concrete
//! [`dregg_app_framework::Reactor`] exemplar in the starbridge-apps tree. Where the
//! [`crate::service`] face is the **command** front-door (a `publish`/`consume` turn
//! comes *in*, caller-driven), this is the **reaction** front-door: a service that
//! WATCHES the feed cell and, when a `publish` commits, REACTS by emitting its own
//! `consume` turn — event-driven, the on-chain agent-loop.
//!
//! [`SubscriptionConsumerReactor`] is an **auto-draining consumer**: it watches the
//! feed for committed [`publish`](crate::service::METHOD_PUBLISH) ops and reacts by
//! [`consume`](crate::service::METHOD_CONSUME)-ing the just-published item — reading
//! the new producer cursor and the published payload straight off the observed
//! turn's committed effects, then drawing the consumer cursor up to it.
//!
//! Both front-doors are **userspace**: there is NO kernel `Effect::React` (just as
//! there is no `Effect::Invoke`). The reaction desugars to an ordinary [`Effect`]
//! the kernel already enforces and the circuit already witnesses — here, the SAME
//! [`crate::consume_effects`] body a service `consume` desugars to. The reaction's
//! `consume` turn is re-enforced by the installed [`crate::feed_invariants_program`]
//! (the SAME flat invariants the deos surface (AX2) and the service face (AX3)
//! assume): `Monotonic(SEQ_TAIL)` + `FieldLteField(tail <= head)` bite as real
//! executor refusals, so a reaction can never over-draw the feed.
