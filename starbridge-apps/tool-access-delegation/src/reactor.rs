//! # tool-access-delegation — the AUDIT reactor (the reactive twin of `invoke()`, AX5).
//!
//! The fifth axis (AX5) of a modern starbridge-app. Where the [`crate::service`] face is the
//! **command** front-door (a `grant` / `exercise` / `delegate` / `revoke` turn comes *in*,
//! caller-driven), this is the **reaction** front-door: a service that WATCHES the mandate
//! cell and, when a worker `exercise`s the delegated tool, REACTS by emitting an on-chain
//! audit-log turn — event-driven, the grantor's tamper-evident record of how the delegated
//! capability was used.
//!
//! [`MandateAuditReactor`] reads the new meter value off the observed `exercise`'s committed
//! `SetField` and emits a `tool-invocation-logged` event linking the audit record back to the
//! exercising turn's receipt. This is a genuine event→reaction in the delegation lifecycle: a
//! delegated cap should leave a witnessed trail, and the audit is produced REACTIVELY from the
//! committed exercise, not by trusting the worker to self-report.
//!
//! Both front-doors are **userspace**: there is NO kernel `Effect::React` (just as there is no
//! `Effect::Invoke`). The reaction desugars to an ordinary [`Effect::EmitEvent`] the kernel
//! already enforces and the circuit already witnesses, re-enforced by the installed
//! [`tad_born_cell_program`](crate::tad_born_cell_program) (the audit turn writes no slot, so
//! the `WriteOnce` / `Monotonic` / `FieldLteField` caveats hold vacuously — an audit can never
//! perturb the meter it records).
