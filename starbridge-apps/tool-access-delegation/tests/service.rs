//! **The CELLS-AS-SERVICE-OBJECTS proof for tool-access-delegation, end-to-end.**
//!
//! The delegation lifecycle (grant / exercise / delegate / revoke / view) driven through the
//! `invoke()` front door against the real [`EmbeddedExecutor`]. The same guarantees the
//! `bounty-board` / `escrow-market` service exemplars pin, on the mandate's `WriteOnce`
//! scope/rate/deadline + `Monotonic` / `FieldLteField` rate-ceiling program:
//!
//! 1. **The mandate publishes a typed interface** (grant/exercise/delegate/revoke/view with
//!    their auth + replayable-vs-serviced semantics), resolvable as a Service-Explorer would
//!    resolve it (via an [`InterfaceRegistry`]).
//! 2. **An authorized `exercise` commits a real verified turn** — the desugared `SetField`
//!    lands and the meter advances.
//! 3. **The cap-gate bites at the front door** — an unauthorized `exercise` is refused before
//!    any turn is built; nothing is submitted (anti-ghost).
//! 4. **The attenuation CANNOT be amplified** — a delegated N-call mandate gets exactly N
//!    calls: the (N+1)th `exercise` is refused on the commit path by
//!    `FieldLteField(calls_made <= rate_limit)`, and any attempt to RAISE the granted ceiling
//!    is refused by `WriteOnce(rate_limit)` — both EXECUTOR refusals, not userspace checks.
//! 5. **`grant` mints the mandate through the front door**, and `delegate` (the cap-graph
//!    attenuation handoff) builds as a real `GrantCapability`.
//! 6. **A serviced method is the named seam** — `view` refuses to desugar, and an unknown
//!    method does not route.
