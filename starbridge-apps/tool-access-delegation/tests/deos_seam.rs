//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `invoke` fired through the executor against the FULL
//! mandate `Cases` program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so an over-budget / past-deadline / rewind invocation is a
//! REAL executor refusal in the fire path, not a `program.evaluate`-only check. This file
//! proves that seam CLOSED. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_mandate` install
//! [`tad_cell_program`] (the `Cases` floor: the `Always` invariants `WriteOnce(rate/tool/
//! deadline)` + `FieldLteField(calls <= rate)`, and the `invoke_tool`-scoped `Monotonic(calls)`
//! + `FieldGteHeight(deadline)`) on the seeded mandate cell, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO
//! bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`, the
//!      budget-remaining `calls < rate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing
//!      submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_invoke`] submits the FULL counter-advancing turn (reading the
//!      LIVE `calls_made`), and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full `Cases` program on the
//!      produced transition — so an OVER-BUDGET invocation (`calls` past `rate`,
//!      `FieldLteField(calls <= rate)`) and a COUNTER REWIND (`calls` rolled back to forge
//!      head-room, `Monotonic(calls)`) are REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the
//!      half the floor's `evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are genuine
//! (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model.
