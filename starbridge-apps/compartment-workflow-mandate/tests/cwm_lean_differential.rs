//! CWM ADVANCE ⟷ LEAN DIFFERENTIAL — the mirror-drift tooth for `cwm_advance_admits`.
//!
//! `src/lib.rs::cwm_advance_admits` is a HAND-PORT of the proven Lean `cwmAdvanceM`
//! (`metatheory/Dregg2/Apps/CompartmentWorkflowMandate/Core.lean`): DAG-prerequisite ∧
//! per-step compartment clearance ∧ cursor < terminal. A hand port can SILENTLY DRIFT — drop
//! the clearance leg (letting a clerk sign a document), admit past the terminal, or mis-order
//! the prerequisite check — and the proven `cwmAdvanceM` / `cwmAdvanceAdmits_iff` theorems
//! would never notice. That is the out-of-band seam this test kills.
//!
//! The Lean side emits a `#guard`-PINNED decision vector `cwmDiffCorpus` over a fixed grid of
//! `(mandate, cursor)`. This test enumerates the IDENTICAL grid through `cwm_advance_admits`
//! and asserts the SAME vector (`CWM_LEAN_DECISIONS`, copied from the Lean `#guard`). Drift on
//! EITHER side fails:
//!   * `cwm_advance_admits` changes  → Rust vector ≠ `CWM_LEAN_DECISIONS`           → FAIL here;
//!   * `cwmAdvanceM` changes          → its `#guard cwmDiffCorpus == [...]` trips at Lean build,
//!     forcing a re-pin that re-exposes any Rust drift.
//!
//! Grid (matches Lean `cwmDiffMandates × cwmDiffCursors`, row-major):
//!   mandates = [officer (clears review/redact/sign), clerk (clears ONLY review)]
//!   cursors  = [0, 1, 2, 3]   (charter terminal = 3)
