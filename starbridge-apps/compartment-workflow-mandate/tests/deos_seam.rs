//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `advance_step` fired through the executor against
//! the FULL workflow program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md` (the workflow port): the promotion's task
//! is to close the fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so a skipped/rewound step or a
//! past-terminal advance is a REAL executor refusal in the fire path, not a
//! `cwm_advance_admits` / `evaluate`-only check. This file proves that seam CLOSED.
//! `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_workflow` install [`cwm_cell_program`] (the `Always`
//! invariants — `WriteOnce` config slots + `FieldLteField(STEP_CURSOR <= CHARTER_TERMINAL)`
//! — AND the `advance_step`-scoped `MonotonicSequence(STEP_CURSOR)` exact-`+1`) on the
//! seeded mandate cell, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides
//!      the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_advance_step`] submits the FULL multi-effect advance turn,
//!      and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full workflow program on the produced transition —
//!      so a SKIPPED/REPEATED step (a cursor that does not advance by exactly `+1`,
//!      `MonotonicSequence(STEP_CURSOR)`) and a PAST-TERMINAL advance (a cursor past the
//!      charter terminal, `FieldLteField(STEP_CURSOR <= CHARTER_TERMINAL)`) are REAL
//!      executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the half the floor's `evaluate`-only /
//!      `cwm_advance_admits`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! NOTE on the STEP caveat: the floor's `cwm_cell_program` is a `Cases` program whose
//! `advance_step` case carries `MonotonicSequence(STEP_CURSOR)` — the EXACT-`+1` advance.
//! So the genuine no-replay tooth here is a NO-ADVANCE / SKIP (not merely a rewind): a
//! cursor that holds or jumps is refused because it is not `old + 1`. (A rewind is refused
//! too — `MonotonicSequence` is also anti-rollback.) The `Always` case's
//! `FieldLteField(STEP_CURSOR <= CHARTER_TERMINAL)` is the past-terminal tooth.
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are
//! genuine (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model.
