//! # privacy-voting — the vote-forwarding feed as a `Reactor` (the reactive twin of
//! `invoke()`).
//!
//! The fifth axis (AX5) of a modern starbridge-app. Where the [`crate::service`] face
//! is the **command** front-door (a `cast_vote`/`record_tally` turn comes *in*,
//! caller-driven), this is the **reaction** front-door: a service that WATCHES the
//! BALLOT cell and, when a `cast_vote` commits, REACTS by emitting a `record_tally`
//! turn on the POLL cell — event-driven, the on-chain agent-loop.
//!
//! Both front-doors are **userspace**: there is NO kernel `Effect::React` (just as
//! there is no `Effect::Invoke`). The reaction desugars to an ordinary [`Effect`] the
//! kernel already enforces and the circuit already witnesses — here, an `EmitEvent`
//! `vote-cast` on the poll, re-enforced by the poll's installed `always(...)` program.
//!
//! ## What the reactor does — and the honest seam
//!
//! [`VotingTallyReactor`] watches the BALLOT for committed
//! [`cast_vote`](crate::service::METHOD_CAST_VOTE) ops. On a match it reads the CHOICE
//! straight off the observed turn's committed `SetField` on
//! [`VOTE_SLOT`](crate::VOTE_SLOT) and reacts with a `record_tally` turn on the POLL
//! whose effect is an `EmitEvent` `vote-cast` carrying that choice — the poll-side
//! public audit/tally FEED.
//!
//! The reaction is **emit-only by design**, not by omission. [`Reactor::react`]
//! receives ONLY the observed receipt — there is NO live-state access — so the
//! running `Monotonic` tally COUNTER bump (which needs `old + 1`) is NOT directly
//! expressible: a single observed vote carries no running count, and a
//! fire-and-forget reactor cannot read the poll's live tally to compute the next
//! value. So the COUNT bump stays on the COMMAND path
//! ([`record_tally`](crate::service::VotingService::record_tally) /
//! [`crate::fire_record_tally`], which DO read live state); the reactor records each
//! observed vote into the poll's public `vote-cast` FEED. This needs no live read, no
//! schema change, and commits cleanly: the poll's `always(...)` program admits an
//! `EmitEvent`-only turn (the three `Monotonic` tallies and the two `WriteOnce` slots
//! are all unchanged, which every caveat permits).
