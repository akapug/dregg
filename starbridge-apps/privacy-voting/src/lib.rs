//! # starbridge-privacy-voting
//!
//! Greenfield rebuild of the legacy `apps/privacy-voting/` HTTP app as a
//! dregg-native **starbridge-app**: a thin library of [`FactoryDescriptor`]s
//! plus signed turn-builder helpers that compose dregg primitives only
//! (`FactoryDescriptor` + `Effect::SetField` + `Effect::EmitEvent` +
//! `StateConstraint` slot caveats). No `Effect::CastVote`, no
//! `Authorization::Unchecked`, no placeholder signatures.
//!
//! ## The voting model in two factory-born cell kinds
//!
//! A poll is two cell kinds, each born from its own factory:
//!
//! 1. **Poll cell** ([`poll_factory_descriptor`]) — the public tally board.
//!    - `QUESTION_HASH` slot is [`StateConstraint::WriteOnce`] — the question
//!      is fixed at poll creation and can never be re-bound.
//!    - `TALLY_YES` / `TALLY_NO` / `TALLY_ABSTAIN` slots are
//!      [`StateConstraint::Monotonic`] — a tally can only ever **increase**.
//!      An attacker cannot rewrite a tally downward to erase votes.
//!    - each tally slot is additionally **ballot-bound** by a
//!      `AnyOf[Immutable, CountGe]` gate (the `collective-choice` `CountGe`
//!      port): a turn that MOVES a tally must EXHIBIT a non-empty distinct
//!      ballot-cell-id set (`Cleartext` witness) opening the matching
//!      ballot-set commitment slot ([`TALLY_YES_BALLOTS_SLOT`], …) — a
//!      witness-less or zero-ballot tally write is a fail-closed executor
//!      refusal, and every counted-ballot claim is on-ledger-openable
//!      (tamper-evident). The tally VALUE is not yet bound to the exhibited
//!      set's SIZE (a slot-valued `CountGe` threshold is a missing executor
//!      primitive — see the residual pin in `tests/tally_forgery.rs`).
//!    - `CLOSED` slot is [`StateConstraint::WriteOnce`] — a poll closes
//!      exactly once and cannot be re-opened.
//!
//! 2. **Ballot cell** ([`ballot_factory_descriptor`]) — one per voter, the
//!    capability that authorizes a single vote.
//!    - `POLL_REF` slot is [`StateConstraint::WriteOnce`] — pins which poll
//!      this ballot belongs to.
//!    - `VOTE` slot is [`StateConstraint::WriteOnce`] — **one vote per ballot
//!      cell**. Once a voter writes their choice the slot is frozen; a second
//!      `cast_vote` on the same ballot is rejected by the executor with a
//!      `WriteOnce` violation. This is the core anti-double-vote guarantee,
//!      enforced by the *substrate*, not by app bookkeeping.
//!
//! ### Privacy stance
//!
//! Ballot cells are minted from a caller-chosen blinding `token_id`, so the
//! ballot cell id (`derive_raw(owner, token_id)`) is not linkable to the
//! voter's primary agent cell unless they reuse the token. The `VOTE` slot
//! records the *choice code* ([`VOTE_YES`] / [`VOTE_NO`] / [`VOTE_ABSTAIN`]),
//! not the voter identity. A production privacy tier would additionally
//! blind the choice and prove tally consistency in zero knowledge; this crate
//! lands the *unlinkable-ballot-cell + one-vote-per-cell + monotone-tally*
//! substrate that such a tier composes on top of.
//!
//! ## What this crate exports
//!
//! - [`poll_factory_descriptor`] / [`ballot_factory_descriptor`] — the two
//!   `FactoryDescriptor`s, with their slot caveats baked into
//!   `state_constraints` so every born cell inherits the gating.
//! - [`factory_descriptors`] — both descriptors for host registration.
//! - [`build_open_poll_action`] — writes `QUESTION_HASH`, emits `poll-opened`.
//! - [`build_cast_vote_action`] — writes the ballot `VOTE` slot, emits
//!   `vote-cast` (the tally bump is the separate [`build_record_tally_action`],
//!   composable into one turn at the call-site).
//! - [`build_close_poll_action`] — sets the poll `CLOSED` slot (one-way),
//!   emits `poll-closed`.
//! - [`register`] — mounts the app's factories + inspectors on a
//!   [`StarbridgeAppContext`].

// ELIGIBILITY-PROVEN VOTING — the privacy-voting × identity interlock.
//
// The base ballot proves *one vote per cell* but says nothing about *who may
// vote*. An eligibility-gated ballot adds one caveat — a
// `SenderAuthorized{CredentialSet}` — so the ballot can be bound + cast only by
// a holder of an eligibility credential issued by `issuer_cell` under
// `schema_id` (an `starbridge-identity` issuer's schema). Because the credential
// is presented as an ANONYMOUS zero-knowledge presentation
// (`identity::present_anonymous`), the voter proves "I am in the electorate"
// WITHOUT revealing which eligible voter they are — the selective-disclosure
// primitive applied to the ballot. Layered on top of this app's existing
// blinding-token unlinkability, the cast is doubly private: the ballot cell does
// not link to the voter's primary cell, and the eligibility proof names no one.
//
// The gate dispatches through the SAME `WitnessedPredicateRegistry` the executor
// already runs for every `SenderAuthorized` caveat (the credential-set verifier
// is a registered builtin), so eligibility is enforced in-band on the cast turn,
// not checked out of band. The `(issuer_cell, schema_id)` a poll pins is exactly
// `identity::credential_set_commitment(issuer_cell, &schema)` — one shared
// commitment binds the two apps.

//
// `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: privacy-voting, re-expressed as a composed
// [`DeosApp`] and PROMOTED into `src/` (it lived only in the floor's factory-birth tests).
// The interaction surface is ONE [`DeosApp`] ([`voting_app`] below) with **TWO cells** —
// the poll cell (the public tally board) and the ballot cell (the per-voter capability) —
// each carrying its own affordances; the framework wires the rest (per-viewer projection,
// the web-of-cells publish, the rehydratable snapshot, the generated component, the
// manifest), none of which the floor's factory-born bones had.
//
// ## Two cells, distinct CellIds (the two-cell subtlety)
//
// A `DeosApp`'s cells must have distinct [`CellId`]s. The POLL cell is the agent's OWN cell
// (`cipherclerk.cell_id()`) so fires execute against the seeded embedded ledger. The BALLOT
// cell is a distinct COMPANION cell, derived deterministically from the agent's pubkey under
// a fixed blinding token ([`ballot_cell_id`]) and birthed into the SAME embedded ledger
// ([`seed_ballot`] does `EmbeddedExecutor::ensure_cell` + grants the agent a cap reaching it,
// mirroring the factory-birth companion-cell pattern). BOTH cells are seeded so the gated
// fires have live state — a fire whose target cell has no live state is fail-closed
// (`cell_state` returns `None` ⇒ `StateConditionUnmet`). In production the ballot is a real
// per-voter factory-born cell (`ballot_factory_descriptor` mints it under the voter's own
// blinding token); here one operator agent seeds both for the end-to-end fire.
//
// ## The seam is closed — a TWO-TEMPO fire
//
// The state-mutating operations (`cast_vote`, `record_tally`, `close_poll`) are
// [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a live-state PRECONDITION; the FULL slot caveats (the
// ballot's `WriteOnce(VOTE)`, the poll's `Monotonic(tally)` + `WriteOnce(CLOSED)`) are
// INSTALLED on the seeded cells ([`seed_poll`] / [`seed_ballot`]) and RE-ENFORCED by the
// executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND — nothing
//      submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this);
//   2. [`fire_cast_vote`] / [`fire_record_tally`] / [`fire_close_poll`] then submit the FULL
//      turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the installed caveats — so a SECOND `cast_vote`
//      rewriting the ballot's `VOTE` (`WriteOnce(VOTE)`), a tally REWIND
//      (`Monotonic(TALLY_*)`), and a poll RE-OPEN (`WriteOnce(CLOSED)`) are REAL executor
//      refusals in the SUBMISSION path — the half the floor's `evaluate`-only tests never
//      exercised through a real signed turn (see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).
