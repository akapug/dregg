//! # privacy-voting — the propose/vote/tally lifecycle as a SERVICE CELL on the
//! `invoke()` front door.
//!
//! The third axis (AX3) of a modern starbridge-app: the poll + ballot lifecycle
//! re-expressed as a CELLS-AS-SERVICE-OBJECTS citizen (after the `bounty-board`,
//! `kvstore`, and `escrow-market` exemplars). A `service` module on the existing
//! crate that publishes a first-class, typed [`InterfaceDescriptor`] and drives the
//! lifecycle through the [`dregg_app_framework::invoke`] front door — the userspace
//! method-dispatch layer that sits *slightly above* the effect-VM and desugars a
//! method call to the ordinary verified effects it names. There is **no
//! `Effect::Invoke`**, no kernel change, no new circuit rung: the kernel and the
//! light client keep seeing only the
//! [`SetField`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::SetField) /
//! [`EmitEvent`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::EmitEvent) effects they already enforce
//! and witness. The one extra fact — that an invoked method is a member of the cell's
//! interface — is decided by the SAME verified DFA router
//! ([`InterfaceDescriptor::route_method`]) the protocol already uses.
//!
//! ## A TWO-CELL service object
//!
//! Privacy-voting is two cells (the [`crate`] AX1 floor): a POLL cell (the public
//! tally board — `QUESTION_HASH` `WriteOnce`, three `Monotonic` tallies, `CLOSED`
//! `WriteOnce`) and a per-voter BALLOT cell (`POLL_REF` `WriteOnce`, `VOTE`
//! `WriteOnce` — one vote per ballot). [`VotingService`] bundles BOTH cells and
//! routes each method to the cell it acts on: `cast_vote` targets the BALLOT, the
//! other mutators target the POLL. One published [`InterfaceDescriptor`] names all
//! five methods; the per-method target is the service handle's job.
//!
//! ## The published interface (the lifecycle as typed methods)
//!
//! | method         | target | semantics                | auth        | desugars to |
//! |----------------|--------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|
//! | `open_poll`    | poll   | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | `SetField(QUESTION_HASH)` + `EmitEvent(poll-opened)` |
//! | `cast_vote`    | ballot | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | `SetField(POLL_REF, VOTE)` + `EmitEvent(vote-cast)` |
//! | `record_tally` | poll   | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | `SetField(tally_slot)` + `SetField(ballots_slot)` + ballot-set `Cleartext` witness + `EmitEvent(vote-cast)` |
//! | `close_poll`   | poll   | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | `SetField(CLOSED)` + `EmitEvent(poll-closed)` |
//! | `view`         | poll   | [`Semantics::Serviced`]  | `None`      | — (the named OFE seam: a pure read, no turn) |
//!
//! The four mutators are **replayable**: they desugar (via `invoke()`) to a verified
//! turn whose post-state the executor checks against the cell's installed
//! [`CellProgram`](dregg_cell::program::CellProgram) (the SAME `always(...)` programs
//! the AX1 floor and the AX2 deos surface install). `view` is **serviced**: the
//! poll's committed tally state IS the answer (it rides the OFE cross-cell-read), so
//! `invoke()` refuses to desugar it and names the seam honestly rather than faking a
//! write.
//!
//! ## The verified guarantee (the program bites)
//!
//! The cap-gate (`Signature` on every mutator) is enforced twice over: at the
//! `invoke()` front door (an unauthorized caller is refused before any turn is built
//! — anti-ghost) and again by the executor (the desugared turn carries a real
//! signature the kernel verifies). The voting teeth re-enforce on the
//! invoke()-desugared turns exactly as on the floor: a SECOND `cast_vote` is an
//! EXECUTOR refusal on `WriteOnce(VOTE)`, a tally REWIND is a refusal on
//! `Monotonic(TALLY_*)`, a poll RE-OPEN is a refusal on `WriteOnce(CLOSED)` — real
//! protocol-layer refusals, not userspace checks.
