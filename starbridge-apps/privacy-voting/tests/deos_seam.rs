//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `cast_vote` / `record_tally` / `close_poll` fired
//! through the executor against the FULL slot caveats, so the verified caveats BITE in the
//! fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so a double vote / tally rewind / poll re-open is a REAL
//! executor refusal in the fire path, not an `evaluate`-only check. This file proves that
//! seam CLOSED on a TWO-CELL app. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_poll` / `src::seed_ballot`
//! install the poll program (`Monotonic(TALLY_*)` + `WriteOnce(CLOSED)`) and the ballot
//! program (`WriteOnce(VOTE)`) on the seeded cells, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the
//!      button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_cast_vote`] / [`fire_record_tally`] / [`fire_close_poll`]
//!      submit the FULL turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the installed caveats on the
//!      produced transition — so a SECOND cast_vote rewriting `VOTE` (`WriteOnce(VOTE)`), a
//!      tally REWIND (`Monotonic(TALLY_YES)`), and a poll RE-OPEN (`CLOSED` 1->0,
//!      `WriteOnce(CLOSED)`) are REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the half the
//!      floor's `evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are genuine
//! (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model. Run `--release` (the
//! embedded executor is slow in debug).
