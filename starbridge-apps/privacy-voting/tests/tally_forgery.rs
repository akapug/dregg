//! THE TALLY-BINDING TOOTH (flipped 2026-07-17, acc/voting-fix): the poll's
//! tally board is now BALLOT-BOUND at the executor. The 2026-07-17 4swarm
//! fic-apps forgery — `record_tally` writing an arbitrary caller-supplied
//! `new_tally` gated only by `Signature` + `Monotonic`, so a poll operator
//! could post ANY tally ≥ current with ZERO ballots cast — is REFUSED.
//!
//! THE FIX (ported from `collective-choice`'s `CountGe` quorum gate, at its
//! weighted-poll floor of 1): each tally slot carries an
//! `AnyOf[Immutable, CountGe{1, ballots_slot}]` caveat in the poll's
//! `CellProgram`. A turn that MOVES a tally must EXHIBIT — as its unique
//! `Cleartext` witness blob, a postcard `Vec<[u8; 32]>` — a NON-EMPTY set of
//! distinct ballot-cell ids whose canonical sorted-set commitment
//! ([`dregg_cell::count_ge_set_commitment`]) opens the choice's ballot-set
//! commitment slot's NEW value. A witness-less or empty-set tally write is a
//! fail-closed EXECUTOR refusal, and every counted-ballot claim becomes an
//! on-ledger-openable commitment (tamper-EVIDENT, as the crate docs claim).
//!
//! RESIDUAL, honestly pinned below (`residual_*` — passes while the gap is
//! open; flip it when the primitive lands): the tally VALUE is not bound to
//! the exhibited set's SIZE. `StateConstraint::CountGe`'s threshold is a
//! program-build-time CONSTANT, and the executor has NO atom relating a slot's
//! numeric value to the distinct-count of the exhibited/committed set — the
//! missing primitive is a slot-valued-threshold CountGe (e.g.
//! `CountGeSlot { count_index, set_commitment_slot }`: exhibited distinct set
//! opens `new[set_commitment_slot]` AND `|set| >= u64(new[count_index])`), or
//! equivalently a `SimpleStateConstraint::Witnessed` so a Custom dynamic-count
//! predicate could compose under `AnyOf[Immutable, …]`. Also named: set
//! ELEMENTS are not verified to be real factory-born ballot cells that voted
//! this choice — the SAME honest scope `StateConstraint::CountGe` documents
//! and the SAME residual `collective-choice`'s quorum gate carries (full
//! closure is the ZK tally tier the crate docs already name).
