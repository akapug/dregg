//! # Sealed-escrow atomic-swap marketplace (Starbridge app)
//!
//! Two mutually-distrustful parties exchange value with **no trusted
//! intermediary**: "I give you X iff you give me Y." The app's escrow IS the
//! protocol-proven [`SealedEscrow`](dregg_cell::escrow_sealed) capacity — a real
//! *witnessed* escrow commitment, not decorative slot arithmetic. Each party
//! locks one conforming *leg* of the trade into the escrow cell's committed
//! heap; the exchange completes **atomically** only when both legs are present;
//! and until completion each party may **reclaim** its own leg. No party can
//! ever walk away holding the counterparty's leg without a genuine own deposit,
//! and no leg is claimable twice.
//!
//! [`SealedEscrowMarket`] drives that capacity end-to-end, playing the executor
//! role: it opens the escrow (sealing the swap terms into the commitment), takes
//! each party's deposit (moving value into custody, conservation-respecting),
//! settles atomically (crossing each leg to its counterparty), and supports
//! reclaim (the depositor made whole on a half-open trade). The forge-rejecting
//! verification core ([`EscrowState::check_claim`] / [`EscrowState::settlement`])
//! is the protocol's, imaged by the Lean rung
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Deos/SealedEscrow.lean`.
//!
//! What the app genuinely does — each proven in `tests/atomic_swap.rs`:
//!   1. **Witnessed deposit** — locking a leg moves the escrow cell's canonical
//!      commitment (a light client SEES value enter).
//!   2. **Atomic settlement** — both legs cross to their counterparties in one
//!      step; there is no half-open trade.
//!   3. **Conservation** — total value per asset is invariant across the run.
//!   4. **The half-open-trade attack defeated** — a ghosting counterparty cannot
//!      claim; the depositor reclaims and is made whole.
//!
//! ## The value face ([`EscrowVault`], `Payable`)
//!
//! The escrow's held value is a conserved credit balance on a vault cell; the
//! escrow receives value as a real `Effect::Transfer` and settles it onward to
//! the payee through the shared [`Payable`] interface, so per-asset `Σδ=0` holds
//! across app boundaries (bounty→escrow→payee).
//!
//! ## Legacy compat surface (RETAINED, demoted)
//!
//! A pre-existing slot-caveat "delivery lifecycle" (`list → fund → ship →
//! settle`, the four-organ `CellProgram` below, with its `DeosApp`/`service`/
//! factory faces) is RETAINED at the crate root because out-of-scope dependents
//! (`starbridge-first-room`, `starbridge-v2`) import it. It is no longer the
//! app's headline escrow — the [`SealedEscrowMarket`] above is. The slot caveats
//! model *bounded scalar fields*, not a movable witnessed asset; for genuine
//! trustless value exchange, use the sealed capacity.
//!
//! ## The order lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! LISTED ──fund──▶ FUNDED ──ship──▶ SHIPPED ──settle──▶ SETTLED
//! ```
//!
//! - **list**   — the seller opens a listing: writes the `CEILING` (the max the
//!   buyer may escrow) and the `SELLER_HASH`, `STATE = LISTED`.
//! - **fund**   — the buyer escrows `amount ≤ CEILING` into `ESCROWED`, binds
//!   `BUYER_HASH`, `STATE → FUNDED`.
//! - **ship**   — the seller commits the sealed-delivery digest into
//!   `DELIVERY_HASH` (the mailbox sealed-intent commitment), `STATE → SHIPPED`.
//! - **settle** — the deal closes: `RELEASED + REFUNDED == ESCROWED`,
//!   `STATE → SETTLED`. Full delivery ⇒ `RELEASED == ESCROWED, REFUNDED == 0`;
//!   a refund ⇒ `RELEASED == 0, REFUNDED == ESCROWED` (or any conserving split).

//
// **The seam is closed** — a TWO-TEMPO fire (mirror supply-chain-provenance / subscription).
// The three state-advancing operations (`fund`, `ship`, `settle`) are [`GatedAffordance`]s
// carrying a live-state PRECONDITION (a STATE check: `fund` needs LISTED, `ship` needs FUNDED,
// `settle` needs SHIPPED); the FULL escrow program ([`escrow_cell_program`], a method-dispatched
// `Cases` carrying TRUSTLINE `FieldLteField(ESCROWED <= CEILING)`, MAILBOX `WriteOnce(DELIVERY)`,
// FLASHWELL `AffineEq(RELEASED + REFUNDED == ESCROWED)` on settle + the universal
// `AffineLe(<= ESCROWED)`, and LIFECYCLE `StrictMonotonic(STATE)`) is INSTALLED on the seeded
// escrow cell ([`seed_escrow`]) and RE-ENFORCED by the executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition
//      `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND — nothing submitted on a miss
//      (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this);
//   2. [`fire_fund`] / [`fire_ship`] / [`fire_settle`] then submit the FULL multi-effect turn
//      (built from the cell's LIVE state), and the executor RE-ENFORCES the installed program — so
//      an OVER-CEILING fund (`FieldLteField`), a value-conjuring settle (`AffineEq`/`AffineLe`), and
//      a non-advancing/rewinding STATE (`StrictMonotonic`) are REAL executor refusals in the
//      SUBMISSION path — the half the floor's `evaluate_with_meta`-only tests never exercised
//      through a real signed turn (see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).
//
// The installed `Cases` program carries the METHOD SYMBOL (`fund`/`ship`/`settle`), which the
// executor re-enforces on the submitted full turn; the deos precondition is a SEPARATE small
// `Predicate` (a state check) the gated affordance evaluates in-band. The settle fire reads live
// `ESCROWED` and releases it IN FULL, so the FLASHWELL `AffineEq(RELEASED + REFUNDED == ESCROWED)`
