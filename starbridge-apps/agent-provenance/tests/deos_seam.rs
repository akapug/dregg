//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `append_entry` fired through the executor against
//! the FULL provenance program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so a REWOUND head / an OVERWRITTEN entry is a REAL
//! executor refusal in the fire path, not a `program.evaluate`-only check. This file
//! proves that seam CLOSED. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_log` install
//! [`provenance_cell_program`] (`Monotonic(HEAD)` + `WriteOnce(entry slots)`) on the
//! seeded log cell, and the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides
//!      the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_append_entry`] submits the FULL multi-effect append turn
//!      (read live HEAD + TIP, write the new entry's `WriteOnce` slot, advance HEAD, point
//!      TIP, emit), and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full provenance program on the
//!      produced transition — so a REWOUND head (`Monotonic(HEAD)`) and an OVERWRITE of a
//!      sealed entry (`WriteOnce`) are REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the
//!      half the floor's `evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are
//! genuine (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model. NB: `Monotonic`
//! is `>=`, so a no-op head (1->1) is ALLOWED — the genuine no-replay tooth is a REWIND.
