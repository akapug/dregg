//! # Sealed-intent multi-agent coordination (Starbridge usecase app #2)
//!
//! Several agents COMPETE for a single award — a compute slot, a task assignment, a contract — by
//! submitting *sealed* bids during a COMMIT phase, then REVEALING them, after which the winning bid
//! SETTLES atomically through the verified per-asset executor. Because the commit is a hash binding
//! `(bidder, value, nonce)`, no agent can peek at, copy, or front-run another's bid before the
//! reveal: the sealed commitment hides the value (and the nonce blinds even low-entropy values) and
//! binds the bidder to exactly one bid.
//!
//! This is the executable surface of the Lean development
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Intent/SealedAuction.lean`, which PROVES the guarantees this crate enforces:
//!
//! | Lean keystone                       | What it guarantees                                   |
//! |-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `reveal_binds_committed`            | a sealed commitment opens to EXACTLY its bid (CR) —  |
//! |                                     | no peeking-then-switching.                           |
//! | `reveal_requires_reveal_phase`      | no reveal binds before the commit phase closes.      |
//! | `uncommitted_cannot_open`/`_win`    | a non-committed party can never reveal, hence settle.|
//! | `settle_atomic`                     | the award is all-or-nothing (a leg failure aborts).  |
//! | `settle_conserves`                  | the award is value-neutral (no mint/burn).           |
//! | `winner_was_committed`              | the award binds back to a real prior commitment.     |
//!
//! ## Routing through the VERIFIED executor
//!
//! Settlement does NOT re-implement ledger arithmetic. It builds the award ring — leg 1: the winner
//! pays its bid to the seller; leg 2: the seller's slot cell delivers the task-token to the winner —
//! and folds it through [`dregg_intent::verified_settle::settle_ring_verified`], the Rust mirror of
//! the Lean `Ring.settleRing`/`SealedAuction.settle`. That fold runs the verified per-asset
//! transition `recKExecAsset` for every leg (and, when the host has registered the Lean intent gate
//! — `dregg-exec-lean::register_distributed_gates()`, as a native node does at startup — cross-checks
//! each leg against the REAL Lean FFI export; unregistered, no FFI cross-check runs). A leg that
//! fails its gate aborts
//! the whole award (atomicity); a committed award provably conserves every asset (conservation). The
//! coordination is therefore settled by the verified executor, not by a Rust-only shadow.
//!
//! ## The sealed commitment
//!
//! `seal(bid) = BLAKE3_derive_key("dregg-sealed-auction bid v1", bidder || value || nonce)` — the
//! same construction as the running `intent::commit_reveal_fulfillment::compute_commitment_hash`,
//! and the Rust image of the Lean `SealedAuction.sealOf` (`Blake3Kernel.hash [bidder, sign, |value|,
//! nonce]`). Collision-resistance is the assumption the binding rests on (proved non-vacuously in
//! Lean against the reference `Blake3Kernel` carrier).
//!
//! ## The commit phase is now ON-LEDGER (the deos floor)
//!
//! The original commit phase was an in-process `BTreeMap` of seals — the anti-front-running
//! guarantee lived in a Rust check, not in the executor. The deos floor LIFTS the commit board
//! ON-LEDGER: an auction is a **factory-born sovereign cell** ([`auction_factory_descriptor`])
//! whose exact installed [`CellProgram`] ([`auction_factory_cell_program`]) is content-addressed
//! by [`auction_child_program_vk`] and re-checked by the verified executor on every touching turn:
//!
//!   * [`PHASE_SLOT`] — the lifecycle phase code (`COMMIT=0 → REVEAL=1 → RESOLVED=2`).
//!     `AllowedTransitions` admits only self-pairs and the two adjacent advances, refusing
//!     rewinds, skipped phases, and out-of-range phases. The exact factory-installed
//!     [`auction_cell_program`] also binds `StrictMonotonic` to phase-advancing methods.
//!   * `COMMIT_BASE + i` — the i-th bidder's sealed commitment. Each `WriteOnce` — a sealed bid
//!     is FROZEN the instant it is committed: you cannot overwrite a committed bid (the
//!     anti-front-running tooth, now an EXECUTOR REFUSAL, not a `BTreeMap` membership check). The
//!     [`Bid::seal`] digest is the value written.
//!   * [`SELLER_SLOT`] — the awarding party (`WriteOnce`, bound at seed). [`WINNER_SLOT`] /
//!     [`HIGH_BID_SLOT`] — written at resolve (`WriteOnce` — the result freezes once announced).
//!
//! The in-process [`Auction`] / [`Bid`] commit-reveal state machine below is PRESERVED (it is the
//! executable witness of the commit-reveal CRYPTO — `seal` binding, the phase gate, settlement
//! through the verified executor); the on-ledger cell is the ADDITIVE deos floor that makes
//! "you cannot overwrite a committed bid" a real executor refusal.

//
// The lifecycle operations are ONE [`DeosApp`] ([`auction_app`] below); the framework

// `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component, and the manifest.
//
// **The seam is closed** — a TWO-TEMPO fire (mirror escrow-market / supply-chain).
// The state-mutating operations (`commit_bid`, `close_commit`, `reveal_bid`, `resolve`)
// are [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a live-state PHASE PRECONDITION; the FULL auction
// program ([`auction_cell_program`]: the `WriteOnce` commit board + the
// `StrictMonotonic(PHASE)` lifecycle) is INSTALLED on the seeded auction cell
// ([`seed_auction`]) and RE-ENFORCED by the executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      PHASE precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND
//      — nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this);

//      submit the FULL multi-effect turn (built from the cell's LIVE state), and the
//      executor RE-ENFORCES the installed program — so OVERWRITING a committed bid
