//! Factory-BIRTH executor tests for the sealed-auction: an auction cell coming
//! alive through the REAL verified executor, driven through its
//! `COMMIT → REVEAL → RESOLVED` lifecycle, with the on-ledger commit board
//! enforced on the executor path:
//!
//!   - ANTI-FRONT-RUNNING — overwriting a committed sealed bid is REFUSED
//!     (`WriteOnce(COMMIT_BASE + i)`), now an EXECUTOR refusal, not a `BTreeMap`
//!     membership check.
//!   - LIFECYCLE — rewinding/skipping the phase is REFUSED by the exact
//!     factory-installed `AllowedTransitions(PHASE)` table.
//!   - PROGRAM IDENTITY — the born cell's installed program, advertised VK, and
//!     every subsequent Bazaar-shaped transition remain one exact identity.
//!
//! This is the `#95` factory-birth pattern: deploy → signed
//! `CreateCellFromFactory` → the born cell carries the caveats FOR LIFE →
//! honest lifecycle ACCEPTED, hostile turns REFUSED.
