//! THE SEAM CLOSED — INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TOOTH. The deos-native `issue` / `revoke`
//! fire through the executor against the FULL floor `issuer_program()`, so EVERY verified
//! caveat — the now-REAL `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot)` membership check included — BITES in
//! the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: identity is THE
//! credential-across-trust-boundary web-of-cells story; the promotion's task is to close the
//! fire→full-`CellProgram` seam so a non-+1 issuance / a revocation-root rewind / an
//! UNAUTHORIZED issuer is a REAL executor refusal in the fire path, not a `program.evaluate`-
//! only check. This file proves that seam CLOSED. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_issuer`
//! install the FLOOR's [`issuer_program`] — `WriteOnce(SCHEMA_COMMITMENT)` +
//! `MonotonicSequence(ISSUANCE_COUNTER)` + `Monotonic(REVOCATION_ROOT)` +
//! `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot { ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT })` — on the seeded issuer cell, and
//! the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the
//!      button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_issue`] / [`fire_revoke`] submit the FULL turn derived from
//!      the cell's LIVE state — CARRYING the membership witness ([`issuer_membership_witness`])
//!      — and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full floor program on the produced transition. The
//!      now-REAL `MerkleMembership` STARK admits the authorized signer (proof attached, signer
//!      in the seeded root); a non-+1 issuance (`MonotonicSequence(ISSUANCE_COUNTER)`) and a
//!      REVOCATION-ROOT REWIND (`Monotonic(REVOCATION_ROOT)`) are REAL executor refusals.
//!
//! ## The `SenderAuthorized` seam — now REAL on the green path
//!
//! The verifier is no longer fail-closed: the [`EmbeddedExecutor`]'s embedded runtime
//! defaults to the STARK-backed witnessed-predicate registry, so `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot)`
//! dispatches to a real `MerkleMembershipStarkVerifier`. [`seed_issuer`] seeds
//! `ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT` with `single_member_authorized_root(signer_pk)` (so the firing
//! signer is the sole authorized issuer) and the fires attach
//! `single_member_membership_proof(signer_pk)` — so the honest issuer's `issue` / `revoke`
//! fire GREEN THROUGH the real authority tooth. This file demonstrates BOTH faces:
//!   - (b) the authorized issuer issues green THROUGH the real verifier carrying the proof;
//!   - (d) a NON-member signer (and the right signer with NO/wrong proof) is REFUSED by the
//!     real `MerkleMembership` STARK — the authority tooth biting in the submission path.
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are genuine
//! (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate` + the real membership STARK). No parallel model.
