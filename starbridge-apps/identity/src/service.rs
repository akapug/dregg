//! # identity — the credential lifecycle as a SERVICE CELL on the `invoke()` front door.
//!
//! The per-issuer credential lifecycle re-expressed as a CELLS-AS-SERVICE-OBJECTS
//! citizen (the same template the `starbridge-bounty-board`,
//! `starbridge-kvstore`, and `starbridge-escrow-market` exemplars wear). A new
//! `service` module on the existing crate: it publishes a first-class, typed
//! [`InterfaceDescriptor`] and drives the issuer lifecycle through the
//! [`dregg_app_framework::invoke`] front door — the userspace method-dispatch
//! layer that sits *slightly above* the effect-VM and desugars a method call to
//! the ordinary verified effects it names. There is **no `Effect::Invoke`**, no
//! kernel change, no new circuit rung: the kernel and the light client keep
//! seeing only the [`SetField`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::SetField) /
//! [`EmitEvent`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::EmitEvent) effects they already
//! enforce and witness. The one extra fact — that an invoked method is a member
//! of the cell's interface — is decided by the SAME verified DFA router
//! ([`InterfaceDescriptor::route_method`]) the protocol already uses.
//!
//! ## Non-degrading: the SAME canonical issuer program
//!
//! The service face installs the IDENTICAL canonical
//! [`issuer_program`](crate::issuer_program) the
//! [`FactoryDescriptor`](crate::issuer_factory_descriptor) bakes into every
//! factory-born issuer cell (via [`seed_issuer`](crate::seed_issuer)). So the
//! lifecycle teeth re-enforce on every invoke()-desugared turn exactly as they do
//! on a factory-born cell's turns:
//!
//! | Slot               | Caveat                      | Bites on |
//! |--------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
//! | `SCHEMA_COMMITMENT`| `WriteOnce`                 | the setup turn, then frozen |
//! | `ISSUANCE_COUNTER` | `MonotonicSequence` (+1)    | every issuer turn (`issue`, `revoke`) |
//! | `REVOCATION_ROOT`  | `Monotonic` (append-only)   | `revoke` (a rewind is refused) |
//! | `ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT` | `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot)` | every issuer turn (the authority tooth) |
//!
//! Because `issuer_program` carries `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot)`, a mutator's
//! desugared turn MUST carry the issuer's Merkle-membership witness
//! ([`issuer_membership_witness`](crate::issuer_membership_witness)) for the
//! executor's real `MerkleMembership` STARK to admit the authorized signer. The
//! signature is computed over `Action::hash`, which covers `witness_blobs`, so the
//! witness must be attached BEFORE signing — which [`invoke_with_descriptor`]
//! (which signs internally) forecloses. The mutator path therefore routes through
//! [`resolve_against`] (the routing → auth → seam core that
//! [`invoke_with_descriptor`] itself wraps), attaches the witness, then signs and
//! wraps the turn. The serviced-read and refusal paths — which never build a turn —
//! go through [`invoke_with_descriptor`] directly.
//!
//! ## The published interface (the lifecycle as typed methods)
//!
//! | method   | semantics                 | auth        | args         | desugars to |
//! |----------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
//! | `issue`  | [`Semantics::Replayable`] | `Signature` | `(counter)`  | `SetField(ISSUANCE_COUNTER)` + `EmitEvent` |
//! | `revoke` | [`Semantics::Replayable`] | `Signature` | `(new_root)` | `SetField(REVOCATION_ROOT, ISSUANCE_COUNTER)` + `EmitEvent` |
//! | `present`| [`Semantics::Serviced`]   | `None`      | `()`         | — (the named seam: a holder-side disclosure read, no turn) |
//! | `verify` | [`Semantics::Serviced`]   | `None`      | `()`         | — (the named seam: a verifier-side re-derive read, no turn) |
//!
//! `issue`/`revoke` are **replayable** issuer-state mutators: they desugar (via
//! the invoke front door) to a verified turn whose post-state the executor checks
//! against the issuer [`CellProgram`](dregg_cell::program::CellProgram). `present`
//! and `verify` are **serviced**: a credential presentation is the holder's own
//! disclosure and a verification is a verifier-side re-derivation — neither mutates
//! the issuer cell, so `invoke()` refuses to desugar them and names the seam
//! honestly rather than faking an issuer turn.
//!
//! ## The verified guarantee (the program bites)
//!
//! The cap-gate (`Signature` on both mutators) is enforced twice over: at the
//! `invoke()` front door (an unauthorized caller is refused before any turn is
//! built — anti-ghost) and again by the executor (the desugared turn carries a
//! real signature the kernel verifies). The issuance sequence is a rollback-proof
//! per-turn ratchet at the verified commit path: `ISSUANCE_COUNTER` is
//! `MonotonicSequence`, so a replayed / non-`+1` issuance is an EXECUTOR REFUSAL,
//! not a userspace check — and a revocation-root rewind (`Monotonic(REVOCATION_ROOT)`)
//! and a non-member signer (`SenderAuthorized`, the real `MerkleMembership` STARK)
//! are likewise real refusals on the invoke()-desugared turn.
