//! `starbridge-identity` — userspace verifiable-credentials app composing
//! `dregg-credentials` (G31).
//!
//! Companion docs:
//! - `../../../STARBRIDGE-APPS-PLAN.md` §3.2 — the per-app design sketch
//!   this crate implements.
//! - `../../../BOUNDARIES.md` §2.11 — the credential-presentation boundary
//!   the multi-show-unlinkability test exercises.
//! - `../../../SLOT-CAVEATS-DESIGN.md` — the Lane G slot-caveat vocabulary
//!   used by the issuer factory (`MonotonicSequence`, `Monotonic`,
//!   `SenderAuthorized`).
//! - `../../../APPS-AS-USERSPACE-AUDIT.md` §1.3 — the audit that motivated
//!   the rebuild.
//!
//! # Stance
//!
//! `apps/identity/` (audited 2026-05-24) re-invented credential primitives
//! badly: `Credential` had no signature field; the verifier trusted a
//! `verified: bool` set on the holder; selective disclosure truncated text
//! to 4 bytes. `DREGG-FLAWS-FROM-APPS.md` G31 promoted `bridge::present` to
//! the `dregg-credentials` crate. **This starbridge-app is the thin
//! userspace shell that survives once the credential primitive is
//! correctly factored out**: schemas, factory descriptor, turn-builders,
//! and inspector wiring.
//!
//! All ZK heavy lifting (blinded merkle, predicate disclosure, ring proof,
//! non-revocation) lives in `dregg-credentials`. This crate composes that
//! through cell-programs: `Effect::SetField` + `Effect::EmitEvent`, never a
//! domain-specific `Effect::IssueCredential` or
//! `Authorization::Unchecked` placeholder.
//!
//! # What this crate exports
//!
//! 1. [`issuer_factory_descriptor`] — `FactoryDescriptor` for the
//!    per-issuer sovereign cell. State slots:
//!    - `SCHEMA_COMMITMENT_SLOT` — pinned schema-commitment hash
//!      (`Immutable`).
//!    - `ISSUANCE_COUNTER_SLOT` — strictly-increasing issuance counter
//!      (`MonotonicSequence`).
//!    - `REVOCATION_ROOT_SLOT` — federation-attested revocation root
//!      (`Monotonic`).
//!    - `ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT` — authorized-issuer pubkey-set root
//!      (`SenderAuthorized` with `PublicRoot`).
//!
//! 2. Turn builders:
//!    - [`build_issue_credential_action`]
//!    - [`build_revoke_credential_action`]
//!    - [`build_present_credential_action`]
//!    - [`build_verify_presentation_action`]
//!
//! 3. Common credential schemas (`kyc_schema`, `gov_id_schema`,
//!    `employment_schema`).
//!
//! 4. [`register`] — `StarbridgeAppContext` mount that installs the
//!    factory descriptor and the four inspector descriptors
//!    (`dregg-credential`, `dregg-credential-issue-form`,
//!    `dregg-credential-present-form`, `dregg-credential-verifier`).
//!
//! # What this crate is NOT
//!
//! - Not an HTTP service. Mounting credentials under axum routes is the
//!   host's responsibility — see `apps/identity/server.rs` for the legacy
//!   shape; the starbridge-host imports this crate's [`register`] and
//!   wires it via `AppServer`.
//! - Not a cclerk. The holder's credentials live wherever the host
//!   chooses to store them (inbox queues, `dregg-storage`, etc.).
//! - Not a federation registry. Issuer-membership Merkle trees are
//!   maintained outside this crate; the host wires them through
//!   `PresentationOptions::federation_registry`.

// The four modern app-framework axes this app demonstrates (the unified template):

//     fires — the deos-seam, `tests/deos_seam.rs`);
//   - the SERVICE-CELL `invoke()` front door (typed `InterfaceDescriptor` + method dispatch
//     over the credential lifecycle — `service`, `tests/service.rs`);
//   - the deos-view CARD (a renderer-independent `deos.ui.*` view-tree — `card`).

// The deos-native surface — the ISSUER as a composed `DeosApp`.
// =============================================================================
//
// `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md`: identity is THE
// credential-across-trust-boundary web-of-cells story. The issuer's operations are
// re-expressed as ONE [`DeosApp`] ([`identity_app`] below) and PROMOTED into `src/`;
// the framework wires the rest — per-viewer projection, web-of-cells publish (the
// ISSUER cell IS a `dregg://` sturdyref a relying party on ANOTHER federation
// reacquires to verify credentials across the trust boundary), per-viewer rehydration,
// the generated `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component, and the manifest — none of
// which the floor's turn-builders had. `register(ctx)` now mounts it (see
// [`register_deos`]).
//
// **The seam is closed — INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TOOTH** — a TWO-TEMPO fire (mirror
// nameservice / supply-chain). The two state-mutating operations (`issue`, `revoke`) are
// [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a live-state PRECONDITION; the FLOOR's FULL [`issuer_program`]
// (all four caveats: `WriteOnce(SCHEMA_COMMITMENT)` + `MonotonicSequence(ISSUANCE_COUNTER)` +
// `Monotonic(REVOCATION_ROOT)` + `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot { ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT })`) is
// INSTALLED on the seeded issuer cell ([`seed_issuer`]) and RE-ENFORCED by the executor on
// every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides
//      the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//   2. on both passing, [`fire_issue`] / [`fire_revoke`] build the FULL turn derived from
//      the cell's LIVE state, ATTACH the membership witness ([`issuer_membership_witness`]),
//      and submit it. The executor RE-ENFORCES the FULL floor program on the produced
//      transition — so the real `SenderAuthorized` membership STARK admits the authorized
//      signer (proof attached, signer in the seeded root), an issuance that DOESN'T advance
//      the counter by exactly +1 (`MonotonicSequence(ISSUANCE_COUNTER)`) is refused, and a
//      REVOCATION-ROOT REWIND (`Monotonic(REVOCATION_ROOT)`) is refused — all REAL executor
//      refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the half the floor's `evaluate`-only tests never
//      exercised through a real signed turn — see `tests/deos_seam.rs`).
//
// ## The `SenderAuthorized` seam (the authority tooth) — NOW REAL ON THE GREEN PATH
//
// The FLOOR's [`issuer_program`] carries `SenderAuthorized(PublicRoot { ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT
// })` — only an issuer whose pubkey is in the published authorized-set root may submit a
// state-mutating turn. That tooth dispatches to the executor's witnessed-predicate registry
// under `MerkleMembership`. The [`EmbeddedExecutor`]'s embedded runtime now defaults to the
// REAL STARK-backed registry (`registry_with_real_verifiers`), so the verifier is a genuine
// `MerkleMembershipStarkVerifier` — NOT fail-closed. [`seed_issuer`] seeds
// `ISSUER_AUTH_ROOT_SLOT` = `single_member_authorized_root(signer_pk)` (the firing signer is
// the sole authorized issuer; [`issuer_auth_root`]), and the fires attach
// `single_member_membership_proof(signer_pk)` as a `MerklePath` witness — so the honest
// issuer's `issue` / `revoke` fire GREEN THROUGH the real authority tooth. `tests/deos_seam.rs`
// demonstrates BOTH faces of the now-real seam: (b) the authorized signer issues green THROUGH
// the real verifier carrying the proof (and (b') the SAME signer with NO proof is refused — the
// proof does the work); (d) a NON-member signer (even carrying a genuine proof for its OWN pk,
// which reaches a different root) is REFUSED by the real `MerkleMembership` STARK — the
// authority tooth biting in the submission path.
//
// (`tests/factory_birth.rs` — a FLOOR test — still asserts the fail-closed RED path on
// factory-born cells via UNWITNESSED hostile turns; the real verifier refuses a missing /
// foreign-root witness too, so those red-path assertions still hold.)

/// The identity rights tiers, ON THE REAL ATTENUATION LATTICE — these ARE the roles the
/// floor crate's cap-graph enforces:
///
///   - a HOLDER / VERIFIER holds [`AuthRequired::Signature`] — the narrow tier: it can
///     `verify` a presentation (read + re-derive) and nothing that mutates issuer state;
///   - a PRESENTER holds [`AuthRequired::Either`] — it can `present` (a holder produces a
///     disclosure) AND verify;
///   - the ISSUER / federation authority holds [`AuthRequired::None`]/root — it can `issue`
///     and `revoke` (mutate the issuer cell) on top of everything below.
///
/// So `Signature ⊂ Either ⊂ None` IS the holder/verifier ⊂ presenter ⊂ issuer ladder.

pub const ISSUER_RIGHTS: AuthRequired = AuthRequired::None;

// NOTE: the seeded issuer cell now carries the FULL floor [`issuer_program`] (all four
// caveats, `SenderAuthorized` included) — the now-real `MerkleMembership` verifier means the
// authority tooth bites for real on the green fire path, so there is no longer a stripped
// "in-process-enforceable subset" program. The earlier `issuer_invariants_program()` (the
// floor program MINUS `SenderAuthorized`, used while that verifier was fail-closed) is gone;
// [`seed_issuer`] installs [`issuer_program`] directly.
