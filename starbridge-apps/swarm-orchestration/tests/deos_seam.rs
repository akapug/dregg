//! THE SEAM CLOSED — the deos-native `dispatch` / `open_board` fired through the executor
//! against the FULL swarm program, so the verified caveats BITE in the fire path itself.
//!
//! `metatheory/docs/deos/APPS-DEOS-INTEGRATION-CENSUS.md` (Tier-1 #3): the re-expression's named gap
//! was that a fired affordance ran on the scaffold `emit`/`edit` placeholders, NOT against
//! a factory-born coordinator cell carrying `swarm_constraints()` — so the `AffineLe`
//! budget gate, `WriteOnce` mandate/lead, and `StrictMonotonic` epoch did NOT bite in the
//! deos path. This file proves that seam CLOSED. `src::register_deos` / `src::seed_board`
//! install [`coordinator_program`] (the full swarm policy) on the seeded board cell, and
//! the deos fire is a TWO-TEMPO bridge:
//!
//!   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate ([`DeosCell::gated_fireable_names`] — the cap-gate
//!      `is_attenuation` AND the live-state precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides
//!      the button's verdict IN-BAND, nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost);
//!   2. on both passing, [`fire_dispatch`] / [`fire_open_board`] submit the FULL
//!      multi-effect dispatch/open turn, and the executor RE-ENFORCES the full swarm program
//!      on the produced transition — so an OVER-BUDGET dispatch (`AffineLe(spent_a + spent_b
//!      <= budget)`), a REPLAYED dispatch (`StrictMonotonic(epoch)`), and a meter ROLLBACK
//!      (`Monotonic(SPENT_*)`) are REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path (the half
//!      the floor's `program.evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real signed turn).
//!
//! Every fire is a real verified turn through the embedded executor; both gates are genuine
//! (`is_attenuation` + `CellProgram::evaluate`). No parallel model. Run `--release` (the
//! embedded executor is slow in debug).
