//! # swarm-orchestration — the COORDINATOR agent-loop as a `Reactor` (the reactive
//! twin of `invoke()`).
//!
//! The fifth axis (AX5) of a modern starbridge-app, and the PRIME agentic
//! [`dregg_app_framework::Reactor`] exemplar in the starbridge-apps tree. Where the
//! [`crate::service`] face is the **command** front-door (an `open_board`/`dispatch`
//! turn comes *in*, operator-driven), this is the **reaction** front-door: a
//! coordinator agent that WATCHES the board cell and, when a swarm mandate is opened,
//! REACTS by dispatching the first sub-task to a worker — event-driven, the on-chain
//! agent-loop made first-class.
//!
//! An agent loop (perceive / plan / act / reflect) lives ABOVE dregg and is the
//! integrator's game; dregg owns the ONE seam that matters — the tool-call / turn
//! boundary. [`CoordinatorReactor`] makes that seam the agent's *autonomy*: the
//! reactor PERCEIVES a committed [`open_board`](crate::service::METHOD_OPEN_BOARD)
//! (a posted mandate, read straight off the observed turn's committed effects),
//! PLANS the next move (size a sub-task against the conserved budget), and ACTS by
//! emitting its own [`dispatch`](crate::service::METHOD_DISPATCH) turn — advancing a
//! worker's spend meter, strictly advancing the epoch, and waking the worker. The
//! same loop a human operator would drive by hand, run on-chain and receipted, where
//! every step is a verified turn the executor re-enforces the swarm policy on.
//!
//! Both front-doors are **userspace**: there is NO kernel `Effect::React` (just as
//! there is no `Effect::Invoke`). The reaction desugars to ordinary [`Effect`]s the
//! kernel already enforces and the circuit already witnesses — here, the SAME
//! [`crate::dispatch_effects`] body a service `dispatch` desugars to. The reaction's
//! `dispatch` turn is re-enforced by the installed [`crate::coordinator_program`]
//! (the SAME swarm policy the deos surface (AX2) and the service face (AX3) assume):
//! the atomic budget gate `AffineLe(spent_a + spent_b <= budget)`, the
//! `StrictMonotonic(EPOCH)` no-replay caveat, and the `Monotonic(SPENT_*)` meters all
//! bite as REAL executor refusals — so an autonomous coordinator can NEVER auto-dispatch
//! past the swarm's mandate. The narration-vs-truth property holds for the agent loop
//! too: what the reactor DID is the on-ledger receipt, not what it claims.
