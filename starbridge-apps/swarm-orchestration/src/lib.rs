//! # starbridge-swarm-orchestration
//!
//! **A verifiable agent-orchestration swarm** — multi-agent task coordination where the
//! coordination is cap-secured, receipted, and verifiable, run through the REAL verified executor.
//!
//! An agent loop (perceive / plan / act / reflect) lives ABOVE dregg and is the integrator's game.
//! dregg owns the ONE seam that matters — the tool-call / turn boundary — and this app makes that
//! seam legible: every coordinating action is a verified turn leaving a receipt, every dispatch is
//! bounded by a real capability, every spend is metered against a conserved budget, and an
//! over-reaching member is REFUSED by the executor, the no-amplification guarantee firing at the
//! swarm layer exactly as it fires for a transfer.
//!
//! This is the executable surface of two verified Lean developments:
//!
//! | Lean keystone                              | What it guarantees / What this crate enforces |
//! |--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
//! | `AgentOrchestrationBudget.dispatchConstraints` | the dispatch-board POLICY as ONE program: budget + provenance + no-replay |
//! | `…affineLe [(1,spentA),(1,spentB)] mandate`    | **atomic budget**: `spent_a + spent_b <= budget` — an over-budget dispatch is UNSAT |
//! | `…immutable budgetF`                           | the mandate, once set, cannot be quietly widened mid-swarm |
//! | `…strictMono epochF`                           | **no replay**: every dispatch strictly advances the epoch |
//! | `…senderInField leadF`                         | signed provenance: a dispatch must come FROM the recorded lead |
//! | `AgentOrchestration.worker_authority_subset_orchestrator` | **non-amplification**: a worker's reach ⊆ the coordinator's (`derive_no_amplify`) |
//! | `AgentOrchestration.workForest_conserves`      | the swarm's value moves conserve (no mint/burn) |
//!
//! ## The two cells (the swarm's substrate)
//!
//! **The COORDINATOR — a dispatch-board cell.** Factory-born, its installed [`CellProgram`] IS the
//! swarm policy, re-checked by the verified executor on EVERY turn that touches it:
//!
//!   * `LEAD`     — the appointed coordinator's identity (the signed-provenance anchor); `WriteOnce`.
//!   * `BUDGET`   — the swarm's spend mandate (the conserved ceiling); `WriteOnce` — never widened.
//!   * `SPENT_A`  — worker-A's cumulative dispatched spend; `Monotonic` — never rolled back.
//!   * `SPENT_B`  — worker-B's cumulative dispatched spend; `Monotonic`.
//!   * `EPOCH`    — the strictly-monotone dispatch counter; `StrictMonotonic` — no replay.
//!
//! and the LIFE-OF-CELL budget gate: `AffineLe { spent_a + spent_b - budget <= 0 }` — the swarm can
//! NEVER collectively dispatch more than its mandate. A dispatch that would breach it is REFUSED by
//! the executor BEFORE it commits (fail-closed, no height advance).
//!
//! **The WORKERS — agent cells.** Each worker holds an ATTENUATED capability: the coordinator hands
//! a worker ONLY its sub-task's authority (a cap reaching exactly the cells the sub-task touches, at
//! exactly the rights it needs). A worker cannot exceed the authority it was handed
//! ([`SwarmError::OutOfMandate`], the executor's c-list gate); and a coordinator cannot hand a
//! worker MORE budget than the swarm's mandate (the `AffineLe` tooth).
//!
//! ## The async notify edge (coordination without synchronization)
//!
//! Workers coordinate via the async notify edge: the coordinator's dispatch carries an
//! `Effect::EmitEvent` targeting a worker, which deposits a pending wake in that worker's inbox; the
//! worker DRAINS it in its OWN, separate, receipted turn (a `SetField` ack). The two receipts are
//! INDEPENDENT on-ledger records — causality (coordinator → worker) is visible, synchronization is
//! NOT forced. The corrected `--wake` model: ASYNC ("recipient drains next turn"), not a joint turn.
//!
//! ## The narration-vs-truth property
//!
//! What the swarm DID is provable, not what it claims. The loop could lie about "I was authorized",
//! "I did X", "I stayed within budget" — but the cap-gate REFUSAL, the executor's receipt + the
//! `EventEmitted` dynamics, and the conserved spend against the mandate are the on-ledger truth.
//! An operator audits a swarm she did not write and could not trust, and is nonetheless never fooled.
//!
//! ## Pre-submission assurance (`dregg-userspace-verify`)
//!
//! Before a dispatch forest is submitted, it is linted by the userspace `analyze()` toolkit —
//! conservation (the value moves net to zero per asset), non-amplification (no in-forest grant
//! exceeds a delegated cap), and well-formedness — so a stranger can pre-flight the swarm's plan and
//! SEE it pass (or see a malformed plan's findings) before spending gas. See `tests/userspace_verify.rs`.

// The five-axis starbridge-app template
// =============================================================================
//
// This crate is the full 5-axis starbridge-app, and the PRIME AGENTIC `Reactor`
// (AX5) exemplar — event-driven on-chain agent orchestration:
//
//   - AX1 (factory): [`swarm_factory_descriptor`] + [`coordinator_program`] /
//     [`swarm_constraints`] — the dispatch-board POLICY (atomic budget + monotone
//     meters + no-replay epoch + write-once lead/mandate) installed at birth as the
//     born cell's `CellProgram` and re-checked by the verified executor.
//   - AX2 (deos): [`board_app`] / [`register_deos`] / [`seed_board`] /
//     [`fire_dispatch`] / [`fire_open_board`] — the composed `DeosApp` surface.
//   - AX3 (service): [`service`] — the board as a typed `InterfaceDescriptor` on the
//     `invoke()` front door (the command face).
//   - AX4 (card): [`card`] — the UI as a renderer-independent `deos.ui.*` view-tree
//     (the rich vocabulary: a `DISPATCHING` status pill, the dispatch-lifecycle
//     breadcrumb, the per-worker spend GAUGES filling toward the shared budget ceiling
//     — the `AffineLe(spent_a + spent_b <= budget)` gate VISUALIZED — live lead/budget/
//     meter/epoch binds, and the icon+button Actions section).
//   - AX5 (reactor): [`reactor`] — the autonomous COORDINATOR agent-loop as a
//     `Reactor` (the reactive twin of `invoke()`): watch a posted mandate, react by
//     auto-dispatching the first sub-task within the conserved budget.
//
// AX2/AX3/AX5 all install/assume the SAME canonical [`coordinator_program`] the
// factory (AX1) bakes — no divergent program is invented, so the budget gate +
// meters + epoch caveats re-enforce identically on every runtime axis.

///     board open then frozen — a rogue cannot recapture the provenance anchor. (Sender-binding to

///   * **monotone meters** (`Monotonic SPENT_A/SPENT_B`): a worker's cumulative spend only

// re-expression was the second deos-native test, but lived in `tests/reexpress_deos_app.rs`
// on the scaffold `emit`/`edit` placeholders (the "honest seam" it admitted). This
// PROMOTES `board_app` into `src/`: the same operations are ONE [`DeosApp`]
// ([`board_app`] below); the framework wires the rest — per-viewer projection, web-of-cells
// publish (the BOARD cell IS a `dregg://` sturdyref), per-viewer rehydration, the generated
// `<dregg-affordance-surface>` component, and the manifest — none of which the old bones
// had. `register(ctx)` now mounts it (see [`register_deos`]).
//
// **The seam is closed** — a TWO-TEMPO fire (mirror supply-chain-provenance). The two
// state-mutating operations (`dispatch`, `open_board`) are [`GatedAffordance`]s carrying a
// live-state PRECONDITION; the FULL swarm program ([`coordinator_program`] =
// [`swarm_constraints`]) is INSTALLED on the seeded board cell ([`seed_board`]) and
// RE-ENFORCED by the executor on every touching turn:
//
//   1. the deos PRECONDITION gate (the cap-gate `is_attenuation` AND the live-state
//      precondition `CellProgram::evaluate`) decides the button's verdict IN-BAND —
//      nothing submitted on a miss (anti-ghost; the htmx reactivity rides this);
//   2. [`fire_dispatch`] / [`fire_open_board`] then submit the FULL multi-effect
//      dispatch/open turn ([`dispatch_effects`] / [`open_board_effects`]), and the executor
//      RE-ENFORCES the full swarm program — so the atomic budget `AffineLe(spent_a + spent_b
//      <= budget)` (an over-budget runaway), the `StrictMonotonic(epoch)` (a replayed
//      dispatch), the `Monotonic(SPENT_*)` (a meter rollback), and the `WriteOnce(budget)`
//      (a quiet mandate widening) are all REAL executor refusals in the SUBMISSION path —
//      the half the floor's `program.evaluate`-only tests never exercised through a real
