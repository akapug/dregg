//! Durable channel rosters (.docs-history-noclaude/PERSISTENCE.md §3, the roster caveat).
//!
//! A channel-group cell pins only the roster's COMMITMENT
//! (`CH_MEMBER_ROOT_SLOT`); the member→seal-pk content is node-held —
//! verifiable against the cell but not derivable from it. Without a durable
//! carrier, a node that restarts mid-life serves `RosterStale` (fail-closed
//! but unavailable) until every member re-posts. This module is the carrier:
//! the node writes the postcard-encoded roster after every committed epoch
//! step and reloads it at boot, RE-COMMITTING each roster against the on-cell
//! root before trusting it (a stale durable roster is discarded loudly, so
//! `RosterStale` afterwards means genuine divergence, never a mere restart).
//!
//! This crate stores opaque bytes (the node owns the `Roster` type via
//! `dregg_sdk::channels`), keeping `dregg-persist` independent of the SDK.
