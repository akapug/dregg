//! LIVE-BYZANTINE Attack 5b forge — the SERVED state attestation carries no
//! committee binding (the store now does — Fix B landed — but the API wire is
//! still count-only).
//!
//! The deployed cross-node committee quorum (`node::finalization_votes`, v2)
//! binds `(block_id, merkle_root)` and, since Fix B, is back-filled into the
//! persisted root's `finalization_quorum`
//! (`blocklace_sync.rs::backfill_finalization_quorums`). But
//! `GET /api/federation/roots` (`api.rs::get_federation_roots`) still surfaces
//! a root as `{ merkle_root, signatures: quorum_signatures.len() }` — a COUNT,
//! with no committee verification and no `finalization_quorum` exposure.
//!
//! This forge shows a single Byzantine node can present TWO conflicting state
//! roots for the SAME finalized block, each passing the count-only gate the API
//! serves, so a light client trusting that surface cannot arbitrate them — the
//! committee certificate over the state is not in the SERVED artifact. (It also
//! models the pre-back-fill TRAILING-HEAD shape: a root persisted before its
//! votes converge legitimately carries an empty `finalization_quorum`.)
//!
//! It ALSO pins the Fix-B discriminator itself: `finalization_quorum` +
//! `verify_finalization_quorum` (the committee's v2 finalization votes OVER
//! `(block_id, merkle_root)`) is crypto-bound, not a count — the property the
//! served surface must expose (and a light client verify) to close Attack 5b.
//!
//! The negative arms below are built so each is RED for the check it NAMES, not
//! green-by-over-determination: each varies exactly ONE half of an otherwise
//! PERFECT quorum entry, so deleting the check that arm names flips it to
//! ACCEPT (a clean assertion failure). That requires real ed25519 AND ML-DSA-65
//! material in-file, derived exactly as the live commit path does — see
//! `Committee`. It still never touches the actively-edited `persist/src/tests.rs`.
//!
//! See `docs/audit/LIVE-BYZANTINE.md` Attack 5b (and Attack 3 — the same weld).
