//! Polynomial-evaluation accumulator for O(1) non-membership witnesses.
//!
//! A polynomial accumulator over BabyBear^4 (quartic extension field). Replaces the
//! sorted-Merkle approach with a single multiply-and-add check per ancestor.
//!
//! # Construction
//!
//! Given a set S = {h_1, ..., h_n} of BabyBear field elements (revocation hashes)
//! and a challenge alpha in BabyBear^4 (Fiat-Shamir-derived from a commitment to S
//! via [`PolynomialAccumulator::derive_alpha`]):
//!
//! ```text
//! Acc = product(alpha - h_i) for all h_i in S     (= f(alpha), f(X) = product(X - h_i))
//! ```
//!
//! # Non-membership witness for element x NOT in S (remainder form)
//!
//! The witness is the pair `(quotient, remainder)` with `remainder = f(x)` and
//! `quotient = (Acc - remainder) / (alpha - x)`. The check:
//!
//! ```text
//! quotient * (alpha - x) + remainder == Acc   AND   remainder != 0
//! ```
//!
//! If x IS in S then f(x) = 0, so the honestly-computed remainder is zero and no
//! non-membership witness exists (`non_membership_witness` returns `None`);
//! membership uses the same identity with `remainder == 0`.
//!
//! # Soundness scope (honest)
//!
//! The equation above is an IDENTITY check, not by itself a binding proof: for any
//! public `(Acc, alpha, x)` and ANY chosen `remainder' != 0`, the value
//! `quotient' = (Acc - remainder') / (alpha - x)` satisfies it — including for a
//! member x. Non-membership is sound only when the remainder is independently
//! bound to `f(x)` (the set polynomial evaluated at x): e.g. the verifier
//! recomputes the witness from the set it holds, the witness computation is
//! constrained in-circuit, or the witness comes from a trusted accumulator
//! holder. A bare `verify_non_membership` call on prover-supplied values does
//! NOT provide that binding. (Schwartz-Zippel over BabyBear^4 protects against a
//! prover choosing set elements after seeing alpha — `derive_alpha` binds alpha
//! to the set commitment — but it does not substitute for the remainder binding.)
