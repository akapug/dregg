//! 4-ary Poseidon Merkle tree.
//!
//! A sparse Merkle tree where each internal node has exactly 4 children.
//! Leaves are sorted by their key (the leaf hash of the fact). The tree
//! has a fixed logical depth but only materializes paths that contain data.
//!
//! Key design decisions:
//! - Sorted leaves: facts are inserted in sorted order by leaf hash.
//! - Sparse representation: only populated paths are stored.
//! - 4-ary branching: each level selects 2 bits of the key to pick a child index (0..3).
//! - Fixed depth: 32 levels × 2 bits = 64 bits of key discrimination (birthday
//!   collisions at ~2^32 leaves). For a fuller implementation we'd use all 256 bits.
