//! Hash functions for the commitment scheme.
//!
//! Uses BLAKE3 as a placeholder for algebraic Poseidon hash. The API is designed
//! so that swapping to real Poseidon over a specific field requires changing only
//! this module.
//!
//! # BLAKE3 vs Poseidon2: Architecture Decision
//!
//! This module uses BLAKE3, which is the CORRECT choice for external-facing operations
//! (storage, networking, Ed25519 signature domains, tooling interop). BLAKE3 is:
//! - Roughly 10-100x faster than Poseidon2 for non-ZK uses (the well-known
//!   native-hash vs in-circuit-arithmetization gap; not locally benchmarked)
//! - Widely supported by external tooling and libraries
//! - Appropriate for all paths that never enter a STARK/SNARK circuit
//!
//! The Poseidon2 tree in `poseidon2_tree.rs` provides the ZK-friendly alternative
//! for in-circuit use. These two systems intentionally coexist:
//!
//! - **BLAKE3** (this module): non-ZK paths — storage keys, gossip message hashes,
//!   capability token derivation, general-purpose Merkle commitments.
//! - **Poseidon2** (`poseidon2_tree.rs`): STARK-provable operations — note tree
//!   commitments, nullifier sets, IVC hash chains, anything that must be verified
//!   inside a circuit.
//!
//! This is not a migration TODO — it is the intended dual-hash architecture.
