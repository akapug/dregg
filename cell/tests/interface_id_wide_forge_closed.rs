//! **THE ~31-BIT `interface_id` FORGE IS CLOSED — leaves, chain accumulator, tail.**
//!
//! The hole this pins: `InterfaceDescriptor::compute_interface_id` used to be
//! 1-felt END TO END — each method leaf was ONE ~31-bit Poseidon2 felt
//! (`MethodSig::leaf_felt`, `hash_many` over the method's canonical lanes), the
//! fold accumulator was ONE felt (`acc = hash_many([acc, leaf])`), and the tail
//! wrote that felt's 4 low bytes into a `[u8; 32]` (`felt_to_bytes32`, bytes
//! 4..32 zero). The WHOLE id carried ~31 bits, so an adversary grinding method
//! names could birthday-collide two genuinely DIFFERENT interfaces at ~2^15.5
//! candidates. Downstream that is not cosmetic: `directory`'s
//! `derive_service_factory_vk` BLAKE3s the interface_id — colliding interfaces
//! SHARE a factory VK — and `discover_by_interface` conflates them.
//!
//! The fix is the faithful widening: 8-felt leaf digests (`hash_many_8`), an
//! 8-felt chain accumulator at EVERY fold step, and the injective
//! `digest8_to_bytes32` tail. These tests are the teeth, modeled on
//! `offchain_root_forge_closed.rs`: each derives its colliding pair at test
//! time by a live birthday search against the code as it exists NOW — no
//! pinned constants to go stale.
//!
//! Three exhibits, in ascending strength:
//!
//! 1. [`old_1felt_fold_collision_now_separated`] — two method sets
//!    byte-IDENTICAL under the pre-widening 1-felt fold (reconstructed here
//!    exactly as it stood at `cell/src/interface.rs:163-258` @ `8b08e15c9`),
//!    separated by the new id. Documents the closed hole.
//! 2. [`leaf_lane0_collision_separated_by_wide_leaf`] — two methods whose NEW
//!    8-felt LEAVES collide on lane 0 (differ only in lanes 1..7): the ids
//!    still separate, so the leaf's high lanes are load-bearing. A pipeline
//!    that narrowed the leaf back to one felt would conflate this pair.
//! 3. [`chain_interior_lane0_collision_separated`] — THE anti-laundering
//!    exhibit: two 2-method sets whose 8-felt chain ACCUMULATOR after fold
//!    step 1 collides on lane 0, and whose remaining fold input (the closing
//!    leaf) is IDENTICAL — so the ONLY separating information entering the
//!    final fold step is accumulator lanes 1..7. The ids differ, therefore the
//!    deployed chain transmits the WIDE accumulator between steps. A laundered
//!    widening (1-felt interior carrier, wide final squeeze only) would
//!    REQUIRE these two ids to be equal.
//!
//! The reconstructions of fold interiors below are bound back to the deployed
//! code by full-fold consistency assertions (the reconstructed id must equal
//! `InterfaceDescriptor::new(..).interface_id` byte-for-byte), so exhibit 3 is
//! about the REAL interior values, not a mirror's.
