//! Rate-limited spending allowance — a sub-capability that may spend up to a
//! fixed ceiling of value per epoch, with the ceiling enforced so it can be
//! neither exceeded nor forged.
//!
//! # The capacity (Track 2)
//!
//! An autonomous agent living inside dregg needs to hand a *sub-agent* BOUNDED
//! money: a budget that may spend up to `limit_per_epoch` value per period and
//! REFILLS each period, but can never be drained beyond that rate. This is the
//! house version of a "rate-limited allowance" — pocket money that resets every
//! week but cannot be over-spent within the week. The danger is twofold and
//! symmetric:
//!
//!  * **over-limit drain** — a spend that, together with what was already spent
//!    this epoch, exceeds the ceiling; and
//!  * a **forged headroom** — tampering the committed `spent_this_epoch` DOWN to
//!    fake remaining budget, or advancing the epoch EARLY to illegitimately
//!    refill before the period boundary is genuinely crossed.
//!
//! A rate-limited allowance closes both: the terms (`beneficiary`,
//! `limit_per_epoch`, `epoch_length`, `start`) are sealed into the cell's
//! commitment, and a `spend` step is **bounded by the committed spent-counter**
//! and **monotone in the epoch cursor** — it resets `spent_this_epoch` to `0`
//! and advances `current_epoch` ONLY when the presented block genuinely crosses
//! into a later epoch, requires `spent_this_epoch + amount <= limit_per_epoch`,
//! and writes the advanced counter into the commitment. A holder of the
//! commitment can tell, for any block, exactly which epoch is current and how
//! much of its budget remains — so an over-limit spend is detectable, a forged
//! counter diverges from the commitment, and an early reset diverges from the
//! schedule.
//!
//! # The weld (what already existed, disconnected)
//!
//! This is built, not memoed — it welds onto substrate already in the tree, the
//! same vehicles [`crate::escrow_sealed`], [`crate::derived`], and
//! [`crate::obligation_standing`] use, and it gives the macaroon-layer **budget
//! caveat** (`token/src/dregg_caveats.rs`: a `(id, class, limit, window)` caveat
//! whose `remaining` is *caller-asserted and unbound* — it only rejects an
//! obvious `remaining > limit` spoof) a **committed, forge-detectable home**:
//!
//!  * **The committed heap** ([`crate::state::CellState::set_heap`] /
//!    [`crate::state::compute_heap_root`]) is an openable sorted-Poseidon2
//!    `(collection, key) → FieldElement` map ALREADY folded into the canonical
//!    state commitment. We reserve a collection id ([`ALLOWANCE_COLL`]) for the
//!    allowance ledger: the terms digest, the `current_epoch` cursor, the
//!    `spent_this_epoch` counter, and the cumulative spent total all live there
//!    — bound into the cell's commitment FOR FREE, no commitment-version bump.
//!    Where the budget caveat trusts the caller's `remaining`, here the
//!    `spent_this_epoch` is *committed*, so a forged-down counter is REJECTED.
//!
//!  * **The signed `i64` balance ledger** is the value primitive: each spend
//!    moves `amount` (exactly the quantity [`crate::state::CellState::balance`]
//!    carries) and records it in the committed counter and cumulative.
//!
//!  * **Block height / a monotone counter** is the epoch clock: the epoch index
//!    for a block `b >= start` is `(b - start) / epoch_length`, and a reset is
//!    admissible only when the presented block genuinely lands in a later epoch
//!    than the committed cursor.
//!
//!  * **The nullifier / one-shot discipline** (the escrow leg-consumed tooth,
//!    the obligation per-period cursor) is the shape the epoch cursor takes: the
//!    budget of an epoch is "consumed" up to the ceiling, and only the genuine
//!    crossing of an epoch boundary refills it. An early reset finds the cursor
//!    still in the same epoch and is REFUSED.
//!
//! # The soundness story (what binds the ceiling)
//!
//! An allowance is an [`AllowanceTerms`] (`beneficiary`, `asset`,
//! `limit_per_epoch`, `epoch_length`, `start`) whose digest is sealed at
//! [`KEY_TERMS_DIGEST`], plus three committed cursors. The binding enforces,
//! against a holder of the commitment + heap openings:
//!
//! 1. **The ceiling.** A spend requires `spent_this_epoch + amount <=
//!    limit_per_epoch` (after any genuine epoch reset). A spend that would push
//!    the epoch's running total over the ceiling is REJECTED.
//! 2. **No forged-down counter.** The remaining budget is computed from the
//!    *committed* `spent_this_epoch`, not taken on trust. A claim of "within
//!    budget" whose committed counter does not reflect prior spends diverges
//!    from the commitment and is REJECTED — the same check the honest path runs.
//! 3. **No early epoch reset.** A reset (refilling the budget) is admissible
//!    only when the presented block crosses into a strictly later epoch than the
//!    committed cursor. Advancing the epoch before the boundary is REJECTED.
//! 4. **No stale-epoch overspend.** A spend presented at a block whose epoch is
//!    EARLIER than the committed cursor (a backdated spend trying to reuse a past
//!    epoch's headroom) is REJECTED.
//!
//! The honest-accept path ([`spend`] accepting) and every forge-reject path run
//! through the SAME [`AllowanceState::check_spend`] verification core, so a stub
//! in either direction fails one polarity (non-vacuity by construction).
//!
//! # The minimal genuine slice (this module)
//!
//! - A single fixed-ceiling, fixed-length-epoch allowance in one asset, refilling
//!   to the full ceiling each epoch (no rollover/carry of unspent budget).
//!   Carry-over budgets, variable ceilings, multi-asset baskets, and a bounded
//!   total lifetime cap are the named next slice, not stubs here.
//!
//! # The next slice (named, not built here)
//!
//! The executor-level check here is the genuine forge-rejection. The remaining
//! slice is the **in-circuit witness**: a light client verifying a *batch*
//! should see the ceiling enforced by the EffectVM circuit rather than an
//! out-of-band executor check. That requires (a) a `SpendAllowance` effect
//! descriptor whose gate binds "`spent + amount <= limit` ∧ counter advanced ∧
//! epoch reset only at the genuine boundary" into the commitment, and (b) the
//! Lean rung `verifyBatch accept ⟹ allowance never overspent its rate` joining
//! the circuit-soundness obligation table in
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md`. See
//! `docs/deos/RATE-LIMITED-ALLOWANCE.md` §"Next slice: circuit binding".
