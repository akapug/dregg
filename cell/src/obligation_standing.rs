//! Standing (recurring) obligation — a first-class, schedule-enforced commitment
//! that a cell OWES a fixed amount to a beneficiary every PERIOD blocks.
//!
//! # The capacity (Track 2)
//!
//! An autonomous agent living inside dregg needs to carry *standing* duties:
//! rent, a subscription, a periodic payment, a recurring tithe. Unlike a
//! one-shot bonded obligation (the deadline-and-slash
//! [`crate::blueprint::ObligationTerms`]), a STANDING obligation is *recurring* —
//! it owes `amount` at block `start`, again at `start + period`, again at
//! `start + 2·period`, and so on, forever (or until a bounded count). The danger
//! the agent must be protected from is twofold and symmetric:
//!
//!  * the obligor (or a malicious bookkeeper) **silently SKIPPING** a due
//!    period — claiming "all paid up" while a period went undischarged; and
//!  * a **FORGED discharge** — claiming a period was paid early (before it came
//!    due), paid twice (double-discharge), or paid more/less than committed.
//!
//! A standing obligation closes both: the schedule (`amount`, `period`, `start`,
//! `beneficiary`, `obligor`) is sealed into the cell's commitment, and a
//! `discharge` step is **one-shot per period** and **monotone in the cursor** —
//! it advances a committed `next_due` cursor by exactly one period, can only run
//! once the schedule clock has reached the current due block, and writes the
//! discharged amount into the committed ledger. A holder of the commitment can
//! tell, for any block height, exactly how many periods MUST have been
//! discharged — so a skip is detectable and a forge diverges from the commitment.
//!
//! # The weld (what already existed, disconnected)
//!
//! This is built, not memoed — it welds onto substrate already in the tree, the
//! same vehicles [`crate::escrow_sealed`] and [`crate::derived`] use:
//!
//!  * **The committed heap** ([`crate::state::CellState::set_heap`] /
//!    [`crate::state::compute_heap_root`]) is an openable sorted-Poseidon2
//!    `(collection, key) → FieldElement` map ALREADY folded into the canonical
//!    state commitment. We reserve a collection id ([`OBLIGATION_COLL`]) for the
//!    standing-obligation ledger: the schedule digest, the `next_due` cursor, the
//!    count of discharged periods, and the cumulative discharged amount all live
//!    there — bound into the cell's commitment FOR FREE, no commitment-version
//!    bump.
//!
//!  * **The signed `i64` balance ledger** is the value primitive: each discharge
//!    moves `amount` (exactly the quantity [`crate::state::CellState::balance`]
//!    carries) and records it in the committed cumulative.
//!
//!  * **Block height / a monotone counter** is the schedule clock: the due block
//!    for period `k` is `start + k·period`, and a discharge is admissible only
//!    when the presented clock has reached the current due block.
//!
//!  * **The nullifier / one-shot discipline** (the escrow leg-consumed tooth) is
//!    the shape the per-period cursor takes: a discharge for period `k` is
//!    admissible only when `next_due == start + k·period`, and it advances the
//!    cursor to `start + (k+1)·period`. A second discharge of period `k` finds
//!    the cursor already past it and is REFUSED — a spent period is a spent
//!    nullifier.
//!
//! # The soundness story (what binds the schedule)
//!
//! A standing obligation is an [`ObligationTerms`] (`obligor`, `beneficiary`,
//! `asset`, `amount`, `period`, `start`, optional bounded `count`) whose digest
//! is sealed at [`KEY_TERMS_DIGEST`], plus three committed cursors. The binding
//! enforces, against a holder of the commitment + heap openings:
//!
//! 1. **No early/forged discharge.** A discharge for the current period requires
//!    the presented schedule clock to have reached that period's due block
//!    (`start + k·period`). A discharge presented before due is REJECTED.
//! 2. **No double-discharge (one-shot per period).** The `next_due` cursor moves
//!    forward by exactly one period on each discharge. A second discharge of an
//!    already-discharged period finds the cursor advanced and is REJECTED.
//! 3. **No over-discharge.** The discharged amount must equal the schedule's
//!    committed `amount`. A discharge asserting more (or less) than the sealed
//!    amount diverges from the commitment and is REJECTED.
//! 4. **No silent skip / staleness forge.** [`ObligationState::audit`] computes,
//!    from the schedule and a presented clock, how many periods MUST have been
//!    discharged by now, and checks the committed `count`/cursor reflect it. A
//!    cell claiming "all met" whose committed cursor lags the schedule is
//!    REJECTED — the same `audit` the honest path satisfies.
//!
//! The honest-accept path ([`discharge`] accepting) and every forge-reject path
//! run through the SAME [`ObligationState::check_discharge`] /
//! [`ObligationState::audit`] verification core, so a stub in either direction
//! fails one polarity (non-vacuity by construction).
//!
//! # The minimal genuine slice (this module)
//!
//! - A single fixed-amount, fixed-period standing obligation with an optional
//!   bounded count. Variable amounts, grace windows, partial discharges, and
//!   multi-beneficiary splits are the named next slice, not stubs here.
//!
//! # The next slice (named, not built here)
//!
//! The executor-level check here is the genuine forge-rejection. The remaining
//! slice is the **in-circuit witness**: a light client verifying a *batch*
//! should see the schedule-discharge invariant enforced by the EffectVM circuit
//! rather than an out-of-band executor check. That requires (a) a
//! `DischargeObligation` effect descriptor whose gate binds
//! "due ∧ not-yet-discharged ⟹ discharged ∧ cursor advanced by one period" into
//! the commitment, and (b) the Lean rung
//! `verifyBatch accept ⟹ obligation honored on schedule` joining the
//! circuit-soundness obligation table in
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md`. See
//! `docs/deos/STANDING-OBLIGATION.md` §"Next slice: circuit binding".
