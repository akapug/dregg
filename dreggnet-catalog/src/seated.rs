//! # `seated::SeatedTug` — THE one seat-claiming multiway-tug adapter (skeleton).
//!
//! [`dregg_multiway_tug::TugOffering`] names its two seats by fixed canonical strings
//! (`"multiway-tug:seat-A"` / `"…seat-B"`), while every frontend's user is a *derived*
//! [`DreggIdentity`] key — so an unadapted tug refuses every real user's move as
//! "actor holds no seat". Four byte-peer copies of the fix exist today:
//!
//! - `dreggnet-web/src/seated.rs` (the port source — read in full, 126 lines),
//! - `dreggnet-telegram/src/seated.rs`,
//! - `dreggnet-wechat/src/seated.rs`,
//! - `discord-bot/src/commands/portfolio.rs` (`SeatedTug`, ~line 60).
//!
//! The adapter is frontend-agnostic (it speaks only `DreggIdentity`/`Action`/`Outcome`), so its
//! ONE home is here, beside the catalog that registers it under the `"tug"` key. Phase B turns
//! each frontend copy into `pub use dreggnet_catalog::seated::SeatedTug;`.
//!
//! The bodies are the verbatim port of `dreggnet-web/src/seated.rs` (claim-first-free-seat in
//! `advance`, seat-mapped `render_for` fog, straight delegation for the rest) — the adapter
//! changes NOTHING in `dregg-multiway-tug`.
