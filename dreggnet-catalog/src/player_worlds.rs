//! # `PlayerWorlds` — **one persistent RPG world per derived identity**, in the shared layer.
//!
//! ## The defect this closes
//!
//! [`dreggnet_surfaces::register_surfaces`] mounts ONE `SharedWorld::demo("Adventurer")` per host,
//! and the surfaces key their shelves on that world's single canonical player. Mounted on a
//! frontend's ONE global host — which is exactly what the web and Telegram catalogs do — that
//! means **every viewer shares one inventory**: player A forges a Greatblade and it appears in
//! player B's inventory, listable on B's stall, because there is only one ledger and everybody is
//! "Adventurer".
//!
//! The Discord bot found this independently and fixed it with one `OfferingHost` per derived
//! identity (`discord-bot/src/commands/rpg_world.rs`'s `build_player_host` + its `HostMap`). That
//! fix never came back to the shared layer, so web and Telegram still carry the original bug. This
//! module IS that fix, lifted: the per-identity host construction lives here, so every frontend
//! keys a world by the viewer's identity with one call.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! Isolation comes from the **host**, not from a label: each identity gets its own
//! [`OfferingHost`], with its own world, forge, `AssetWorld`, item registry and sessions. Nothing
//! crosses between them — there is no shared cell to leak through.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut worlds = PlayerWorlds::new();                 // or ::with_store(|id| …) for durability
//! let host = worlds.host_mut(&viewer_identity_hex);     // built (and resumed) on first touch
//! host.ensure_open("craft", &SessionId::new("primary"))?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Which offerings belong here
//!
//! The eight RPG feature surfaces ([`RPG_KEYS`]) and ONLY those. They are per-player by nature (an
//! inventory is yours). The six games and five service offerings in [`crate::build_full_catalog`]
//! are shared tables — a council with one voter per host is not a council — so a frontend keeps
//! routing those to its one global host and routes [`is_rpg_key`] keys here. That is the split the
//! Discord bot already runs.
//!
//! ## Durability
//!
//! A per-identity host is only as durable as its store. [`PlayerWorlds::with_store`] takes a
//! factory `identity -> Option<Box<dyn SessionResumeStore>>`; the host is built with that store
//! attached and then **boot-resumed by replay** ([`OfferingHost::resume_all`], which since the
//! ordered-replay fix re-drives order-dependent logs in a dependency-respecting order rather than
//! the store's arbitrary enumeration order). A store that refuses to re-drive leaves its session
//! closed and its record kept — fail-closed, never reopened to a forged state.
