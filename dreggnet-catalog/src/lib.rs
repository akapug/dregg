//! # `dreggnet-catalog` — the ONE statement of what the DreggNet offering catalog is.
//!
//! [`build_full_catalog`] registers the full 19-offering portfolio — the six games
//! (dungeon · council · market · Dark Bazaar · multiway-tug · automatafl), the eight do-once RPG
//! feature surfaces ([`dreggnet_surfaces::register_surfaces`]: trade · inventory · cheevos ·
//! guild · craft · companion · tavern · party), and the five service offerings (doc · names ·
//! compute · grain · hermes) — into a caller-supplied [`OfferingHost`]. Every frontend builds its
//! host through this one function, so "which offerings exist" stops being four hand-maintained
//! lists (`dreggnet_web::catalog_default_host` + `register_non_game_offerings`,
//! `dreggnet_telegram::host::telegram_default_host`, `dreggnet_wechat::host::wechat_default_host`,
//! and discord-bot's bespoke per-type stores) that can silently disagree.
//!
//! ## What stays OUT of this crate
//! Everything platform-specific. A frontend derives its users' identities with its own
//! cipherclerk (`(bot_secret, platform_uid, federation_id)` → Ed25519 pubkey) and hands this
//! crate only plain `Send` data: the council electorate as raw pubkeys in [`CatalogConfig`].
//! The host is built on whatever thread the frontend's `HostThread::spawn` closure runs, so
//! the `!Send`-session confinement discipline (`dreggnet-web/src/lib.rs` `HostThread`,
//! `dreggnet-telegram/src/host.rs` `HostThread`) is unchanged — this crate never spawns a
//! thread and never holds a session.
//!
//! ## State (Phase A + B-for-Telegram of docs/BOT-SHARED-BACKEND-DESIGN.md)
//! The registrars are complete ports of the (byte-identical) web/telegram registrations, and the
//! [`seated`] adapter is the complete port of `dreggnet-web/src/seated.rs` (the source of the four
//! byte-peers). `dreggnet-telegram` builds its host through [`full_catalog_host`] and re-exports
//! [`seated::SeatedTug`]; web now delegates too, while WeChat delegation and Discord's cutover onto
//! `OfferingHost` are the design doc's remaining Phases B and C.
