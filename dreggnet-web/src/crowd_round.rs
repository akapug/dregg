//! # `crowd_round` — the crowd-stream round driver (the WIRING layer)
//!
//! The converge-later half of the crowd-stream engine (`docs/CROWD-STREAM-ENGINE-DESIGN.md`):
//! it feeds live-stream votes into the REAL quorum-certified vote engine and lands ONE certified
//! world turn per round. Where [`dregg_stream_ingest`] is the pure, dep-light mapping (platform
//! payload → [`WeightedBallot`]), THIS module pays for the offering-stack deps and closes the
//! seam onto [`dungeon_on_dregg::collective::CollectiveRound`] — the tested
//! "signed-ballot tally → one verified turn" primitive.
//!
//! ```text
//! StreamEvent stream                (ingest here, over a round window)
//!   → events_to_ballots / aggregate (one ballot per distinct voter, their strongest option)
//!   → shaped, capped weight          (Linear or Concave/√ shaping; capped per voter)
//!   → weight-replicated custody seats (a $5 Super Chat = 5 seats under Linear; 2 under √)
//!   → CollectiveRound.cast × N       (each seat a REAL ed25519-signed ballot turn)
//!   → distinct-voter floor + quorum  (K distinct humans AND Σ weight ≥ M)
//!   → resolve_into_world             (the quorum gate → ONE certified TurnReceipt on the game)
//! ```
//!
//! ## What is real vs. the named residuals
//!
//! * **Real:** every seat casts a genuine `ed25519`-signed ballot the engine authenticates; the
//!   quorum `AffineLe` gate (`Σ TALLY ≥ M`) still certifies; `resolve_into_world` still binds the
//!   certified decision into the world cell and fires ONE real `TurnReceipt`. A sub-quorum window
//!   or a quorum-certified-but-illegal command is refused exactly as the collective's own tests
//!   prove. This driver only *sources the ballots*; it cannot vote past the executor's teeth.
//! * **Named residual — per-voter custody.** The design's electorate-scaling gap: the demo derives
//!   a seat's `ed25519` secret from its `author_id` string ([`seat_custodian`], via
//!   `Custodian::demo`), so the **platform (us) mints and holds every viewer's key** — it is NOT
//!   real per-viewer custody (the viewer never signs on their own device). Real custody needs a
//!   viewer-held key enrolled out-of-band; until then a Super Chat is authenticated as *coming
//!   through YouTube*, not as *signed by that human*.
//! * **Named residual — one weighted ballot (O(N) crypto).** To land a voter's weight `W`
//!   we materialize `W` (capped, shaped) replicated seats and cast `W` real signed ballots,
//!   so a window costs O(Σ shaped-weight) sign+verify operations under the overlay mutex. The
//!   backing `collective_choice` engine ALREADY has the O(1)-per-voter primitive
//!   (`cast_weighted` / `open_poll_weighted`, with a Lean mirror `castVoteW`: one signed
//!   ballot worth `W`, tallied as `W`), but the `CollectiveRound` wrapper exposes only the
//!   unweighted `cast` — wiring the weighted path through it is a `dungeon-on-dregg` change
//!   outside this crate. Until then we bound the blow-up TWO ways: the per-voter weight is
//!   **capped** (default [`DEFAULT_MAX_WEIGHT_PER_VOTER`], a small ceiling — a whale cannot
//!   mint an unbounded electorate) and can be **√-shaped** ([`WeightShaping::Concave`], seats
//!   ≤ ⌊√cap⌋), so the cost is O(N·√cap), not O(N·64).
//! * **Named residual — dynamic electorate.** `CollectiveRound` fixes its roster at open
//!   ("muster"). We honor that by materializing the electorate at **close** from exactly who voted
//!   this window, opening a fresh round each window. Join/leave within a window is fine; a
//!   persistent cross-window electorate + rotation is future work.
//! * **Named residual — the floor.** The certified turn inherits the deployed ledger's undischarged
//!   FRI/STARK floor; "certified" here means quorum-certified + executor-admitted, not
//!   FRI-sound-on-chain.
