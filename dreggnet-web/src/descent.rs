//! # `descent` — THE SPECTATOR / PROVENANCE surface for *The Descent*.
//!
//! The flagship's **growth artifact** (docs/GAME-STRATEGY.md Phase 3.2 — "the shareable verified
//! run"): a stranger opens a URL and *independently verifies* someone's run of the daily descent.
//! Not "trust me, I did this" — the page **re-executes the recorded run** server-side, on render,
//! against a fresh identically-seeded world, and shows the verdict. The unfair growth mechanic is a
//! proof, not a claim: a forged run shows **FAIL**, not a fake pass.
//!
//! Two server-rendered surfaces, additive to the [`catalog_router`](crate::catalog_router):
//! - `GET /descent/leaderboard[?day={key}]` — the day's **no-cheat leaderboard**: the ranked runs
//!   that provably reached the hoard, each row **re-verified on render** ([`verify_completion`], the
//!   same no-cheat verifier [`ugc_dregg::Registry::reverify_entry`]/`submit` run) against the day's
//!   published [`Universe`]. A forged / incomplete / lost run **does not appear** — it is excluded by
//!   re-verification, not by trusting a stored flag.
//! - `GET /descent/run/{id}` — a **run-card**: the run's summary (day / seed, character level+class,
//!   depth reached, alive/dead, the outcome) plus an **INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION panel** that replays
//!   the recorded receipt chain ([`spween_dregg::verify`] — chain-linkage + re-execution against a
//!   fresh, identically-seeded world) and shows **PASS/FAIL**. An honest run (won *or* lost) PASSES;
//!   a tampered run FAILS. The `id` is the **shareable link shape** the bot's result embed points at
//!   (see [`run_share_path`]).
//!
//! ## What is real vs. named
//! REAL here: the **server-side independent re-verification** — every leaderboard row and every
//! run-card is re-executed from the recorded moves on render (no trusted "verified" bit is stored;
//! [`Run`] is a plain, *untrusted* record, exactly as a persistence layer would hand one back). The
//! no-cheat property is [`ugc_dregg`]'s verbatim ([`verify_completion`]); the run-card replay is
//! [`spween_dregg`]'s audited re-verifier. NAMED, not built here: a live bind address / deployment;
//! *client-side* verification or a downloadable proof (this serves server-rendered HTML — the
//! stranger re-verifies by trusting THIS server, or by re-running the open-source verifier on the
//! recorded playthrough themselves); the `deos-js` live cell render. The bot links to a run by
//! putting [`run_share_path`] in its result embed.
