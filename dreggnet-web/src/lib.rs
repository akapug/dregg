//! # `dreggnet-web` — the WEB [`Frontend`] over the ONE offering core.
//!
//! The third surface (Discord #0 · Telegram · **web**) over the frontend-agnostic
//! [`dreggnet_offerings`] core. A [`WebFrontend`] is an **affordance-renderer**: it derives a
//! per-web-user [`DreggIdentity`], `present`s an offering's [`Surface`], `collect`s a web POST
//! back into a typed `(SessionId, Action, DreggIdentity)`, and — its web-specific job —
//! [`renders`](WebFrontend::render) that deos [`Surface`] into an **HTML fragment**: the room
//! prose/state plus a `<form>`/`<button>` per cap-gated affordance, each POSTing its [`Action`].
//!
//! [`WebState`] hosts the axum surface over a [`DungeonOffering`] (offering #0):
//! - `GET  /session/{id}`        — open (lazily, seeded from the id) + render the current
//!   [`Surface`] as a full HTML page (the fragment wrapped in a document);
//! - `POST /session/{id}/act`    — read the web identity (a `dregg_user` cookie / `?user=`
//!   param), [`collect`](Frontend::collect) the `{turn, arg}` form back into the presented
//!   [`Action`], [`advance`](dreggnet_offerings::Offering::advance) ONE real turn on the
//!   substrate, and re-render (a legal move lands a real receipt; an illegal one is a real
//!   executor refusal surfaced as an honest banner — the anti-ghost tooth);
//! - `GET  /session/{id}/verify` — re-verify the whole committed chain by replay.
//!
//! The executor stays the sole referee: the web surface never trusts a rendered `enabled`
//! decoration — a crafted POST of a dimmed affordance still lands as a real
//! [`Outcome::Refused`](dreggnet_offerings::Outcome::Refused) on the substrate.
//!
//! ## The multi-offering catalog — all offerings, any surface
//!
//! [`WebState`] above hosts offering #0 alone. [`CatalogState`] + [`catalog_router`] make the web a
//! **multi-offering catalog** over the frontend-agnostic [`OfferingHost`]: browse the registered
//! offerings and play ANY of them in the browser through the SAME verbs, the `Session` type erased.
//! - `GET  /offerings`                           — the catalog (a card + "play" link per offering);
//! - `GET  /offerings/{key}/session/{id}`        — open (lazily) + render an offering session;
//! - `POST /offerings/{key}/session/{id}/act`    — advance ONE real turn on that offering + re-render;
//! - `GET  /offerings/{key}/session/{id}/verify` — re-verify that offering's committed chain.
//!
//! [`catalog_default_host`] registers three heterogeneous offerings — a dungeon (game), a council
//! (governance), a market (commerce). Because some sessions are `!Send`, the host runs on ONE owning
//! thread behind a `Send + Sync` [`HostThread`] handle (the discord-bot `Store` pattern generalised
//! to a whole registry) — the SAME host a Telegram / WeChat frontend adopts unchanged.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//! This renders the affordance [`Surface`] as HTML **directly** (server-rendered forms). The
//! fuller path — `deos-js` + `deos-web-cells` (the live signal-bound web cell rendering, where
//! a `bind`/`gauge`/`tabs` node is a fine-grained reactive DOM binding) — is the follow-up, as
//! is a real deployment (a served bind address, a session store, `dregg-pay` credit debits on
//! the paid tier). What is proven here: a REAL `Frontend` over `dreggnet-offerings`, served via
//! axum, DRIVEN — affordances → HTML controls, a POST → an `Action` → one real turn, a session
//! playing through, executor-refereed, `verify` holding.

/// The page's inlined stylesheet — **the design system** for every served surface

///
/// ## The system
/// - **Elevation, not one navy.** Five deliberate ink steps (`--ink-950` … `--ink-600`): the page
///   floor, recessed wells (the board frame, table headers), panels, raised cards. The old sheet
///   painted every container the same `#111a2e`; depth now carries hierarchy.
/// - **The palette IS the argument.** Colour is semantic, never decorative: `--good` = *proven /
///   landed / legal*, `--warn` = *sealed / pending / yours*, `--bad` = *refused / failed*,
///   `--accent` = *the machine* (the automaton, identity, links). A surface's tag (`tag-good`,
///   `tag-warn`, …) therefore reads as meaning, on the board and in a section header alike.
/// - **A type scale** (`--t-micro` … `--t-display`, ~1.22 ratio) and a **4px spacing rhythm**
///   (`--s1` … `--s8`) — every margin/pad is a step on the scale, not an ad-hoc value.
/// - **The mono voice.** `--mono` carries the verifiable material: hashes, seeds, keys, turn
///   counters, and the board glyphs (so `R`/`A`/`@`/`·` sit on one optical grid).
/// - **States.** Every interactive thing has hover / active / `:focus-visible` / disabled. Motion
///   is short (≤ .18s), clarifies (a cell lift, a banner arrival), and is fully disabled under
///   `prefers-reduced-motion`.
/// - **Phone-first.** One breakpoint family at 44rem; the board keeps ≥ 44px touch targets, tables
///   scroll in their own well, and the shell never scrolls horizontally.
///
/// The board (`.coordgrid` + `.cell` + `tag-*`) is the hero: a recessed, checkered well of square
/// cells where a *piece* reads solid (an untagged cell — previously dimmed to `--muted`, the bug
/// that made the grid look like a debug dump), *vacant* recedes to a faint small dot, a *legal
/// target* is a bright mint hint, a *selected* piece rings amber, and the *automaton* glows cyan.

// THE PUBLIC-DEMO SERVER APP — the merged axum Router the `dreggnet-web-server` bin serves.
//
// This is the single blocker to a public demo: the library above is a set of routers over
// in-process state, but nothing MOUNTS + BINDS them. `make_app` assembles the whole surface —
// the games + feature offerings catalog, the single-offering session surface, and the seeded
// no-cheat Descent leaderboard — into ONE `Router<()>`, plus `/` (a landing) and `/health`.
// The bin (`src/bin/dreggnet-web-server.rs`) wraps it in `axum::serve` on a configurable bind.
//
// Node-free by construction: every surface verifies by REPLAY re-execution in-process (the
// offering's own `verify`, the Descent's `verify_completion`) — no testnet, no 45-min prover.
//
// NOW BUILT (this crate, additive):
//  * PERSISTENCE — the Descent leaderboard is durable over sqlite (`descent_store`, rusqlite):
//    with a `DATABASE_URL` set, submitted runs survive a restart, re-verified by REPLAY on boot
//    (`DescentState::load_from_store`) so a tampered row is dropped and cannot resurrect a cheat.
//    Unset → the in-RAM seeded demo (the committed tests' path). The live game SESSIONS (the
//    catalog `OfferingHost`) are durable the same way: with `DREGGNET_WEB_SESSION_DIR` set, each
//    session's move-log persists to a `FileResumeStore` and the host resumes every session on boot
//    by REPLAY (`resolve_demo_host`) — a tampered log refuses to reopen. Unset → in-memory only.
//    STILL EPHEMERAL: the single-offering `WebState` surface (`/session/{id}`, offering #0 alone —
//    the catalog serves the same dungeon durably at `/offerings/dungeon/...`).
//  * An HTTP run-INGEST endpoint — `POST /descent/submit` (see `descent::post_submit`): a stranger
//    submits a run's reproducible input (day + player + move sequence); it is re-executed +
//    no-cheat-verified before it can rank (an honest run ingested + persisted, a forged run 4xx).
//
// NAMED (ops / ember-gated), deliberately not built here:
//  * TLS / rate-limit / CORS — a fronting Caddy (ops, external; `demo.dregg.net` terminates TLS
//    there and reverse-proxies to this bind).
//  * AUTH — the web identity is the unsigned `dregg_user` cookie / `?user=` (a derived key, not
//    a signed credential); a real deployment derives a per-user Ed25519 key as the bot does.
