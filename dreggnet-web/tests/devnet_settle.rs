//! # `devnet_settle` — DRIVE the Descent adventure against a REAL running dregg node.
//!
//! The non-vacuous proof that `dreggnet-web` runs the games AGAINST A DEVNET: a Descent run
//! submitted through the web surface's verify-gate is SETTLED onto a running node's ledger via
//! [`NodeTarget::Federation`] — a real committed turn on-chain (an `EmitEvent`-of-commitment the
//! node signs as operator + finalizes on `GET /api/receipts`), not just in-process.
//!
//! * The [`local_mode_settle_is_an_in_process_noop`] test always runs (no node needed): it proves
//!   the DEFAULT ([`NodeTarget::Local`]) settle is a no-op (`Ok(None)`) — the committed suite +
//!   the node-free demo are unaffected. This is the non-vacuity anchor: the SAME run in Local mode
//!   stays in-process.
//! * The [`federation_settle_lands_a_turn_on_a_running_node`] test is DEVNET-GATED: it runs its
//!   real body only when `DREGG_NODE_URL` points at a running node (else it early-returns, so
//!   `cargo test -p dreggnet-web` stays green with no node). It opens the demo day, submits the
//!   demo WINNING run through the verify-gate, settles it, and asserts the node accepted +
//!   FINALIZED the turn — `NodeTarget::route` returns `Ok(Some(Landed))` only after confirming the
//!   turn hash is on the node's `GET /api/receipts` log.
