//! THE DESCENT FUNNEL, driven end to end — acquire → play → share.
//!
//! Three joints were severed (docs/MATURATION-BACKLOG-2026-07-19.md §2). This suite drives the two
//! that are testable with no network, against the REAL merged app (`make_app`, axum `oneshot`):
//!
//! 1. **CTA reachability** — the product's "Play" affordances point at `/descent/play` (the served,
//!    in-tab game), not at `/descent` (the no-cheat *board*). Before, nothing on the site linked to
//!    the play page at all: it was built, mounted, and unreachable.
//! 2. **The H2 share link** — a run played in the day the SHARED `(day_key, seed)` helper resolves,
//!    submitted the way the Discord bot now submits it (WITH its `day`), re-executes here and RANKS,
//!    so the run-card share link exists. Before, the bot omitted `day` and the web opened a
//!    hardcoded `daily_seed(&[3;32])` demo world, so the re-execution could never verify:
//!    `ranked:false`, no link, every time.
//!
//! The exclusion legs are what make these non-vacuous: a run submitted against a DIFFERENT
//! (re-derivable, in-window) day does NOT rank, and a hostile day key is refused outright.
