//! DRIVEN persistence + run-ingest tests for the public-demo Descent board — the Phase-0 finish.
//!
//! The committed `tests/server.rs` proves the in-RAM demo. This drives the two new deliverables end
//! to end, node-free (axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`):
//!  1. **SQLITE PERSISTENCE** — a submitted run SURVIVES a simulated restart: the store is dropped
//!     and reopened over the SAME file, and the run re-loads, re-verifies by replay, and still
//!     ranks. A TAMPERED row (a persisted move line that no longer re-executes to the win) is
//!     DROPPED on boot — it cannot resurrect a cheat, while the honest run survives (non-vacuous).
//!  2. **THE HTTP RUN-INGEST ENDPOINT** — `POST /descent/submit` accepts an honest run (verify-gated
//!     — it then appears on the leaderboard) and REJECTS a forged / incomplete run (`400`, never
//!     ranked). Fail-closed.
