//! THE PUBLIC-DEMO SERVER APP — the merged [`make_app`] Router, driven end to end with NO real
//! network (axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`). This is the smoke test for the deploy scout's Phase-0
//! unblocker: the ONE app the `dreggnet-web-server` bin binds + serves must
//! - answer `GET /health` 200 (the liveness probe the fronting proxy hits);
//! - list the five games AND the eight do-once feature surfaces at `GET /offerings`;
//! - play a real turn on a game through the merged router (a POST lands a committed receipt);
//! - render the seeded no-cheat Descent leaderboard (the honest winner ranks, the forgery is
//!   excluded) and the run-cards (an honest run PASSes, the forgery FAILs) — all by replay.
//!
//! Green here = a stranger can open the demo URL and play + independently verify, node-free.
