//! **BOTH PORTFOLIO GAMES, DRIVEN THROUGH THE WEB CATALOG.**
//!
//! `catalog.rs` proved the three heterogeneous offerings (dungeon / council / market) play in the
//! browser. This proves the two GAMES do — with no real network (axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`):
//!
//! - `GET /offerings` lists **tug** and **automatafl** beside the rest;
//! - **automatafl** opens, paints its board as a clickable `CoordGrid` (a real POST button per
//!   affordance-bearing square), and a full simultaneous turn plays through the browser:
//!   `select` → `commit` (both seats) → `reveal` (both) → `resolve` — each POST a real landed turn,
//!   the board visibly moving; an ILLEGAL move (a diagonal) is REFUSED and commits nothing;
//! - **tug** opens and a real play LANDS for a browser user (the seat-claiming adapter), while a
//!   third browser user is refused as a spectator;
//! - `verify` holds for both committed chains.
