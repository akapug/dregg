//! **THE PER-VIEWER INVENTORY ISOLATION FALSIFIER, DRIVEN THROUGH THE WEB CATALOG.**
//!
//! The bot↔game review's last live CRITICAL: every web (and Telegram) player shared ONE
//! inventory, because the eight RPG feature surfaces (trade / inventory / craft / …) were mounted
//! on the ONE shared `SharedWorld::demo("Adventurer")` catalog host — so player A could forge an
//! item and it appeared in player B's inventory. This proves the fix over the real HTTP surface
//! (no network — axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`):
//!
//! - **(a) ISOLATION** — two different web identities (`alice` / `bob`) on the SAME catalog have
//!   DISJOINT RPG worlds: alice forges a Greatblade on `craft`, it lands in HER `inventory`, and
//!   bob's `inventory` does not hold it.
//! - **(b) THE REGRESSION GUARD** — a SHARED multi-party table (`council`) is still shared, NOT
//!   accidentally split per-identity: alice proposes and bob approves the SAME proposal, reaching
//!   the 2-of-2 quorum and enacting — impossible unless both act on ONE council.
