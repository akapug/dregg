//! THE DESCENT — the spectator/provenance web surface, driven end to end.
//!
//! A stranger opens a URL and INDEPENDENTLY re-verifies someone's run of the daily descent — the
//! flagship's growth artifact (docs/GAME-STRATEGY.md Phase 3.2). This drives it with NO real network
//! (axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`):
//! - real runs are played on the substrate ([`DailyDescentOffering`] over a fixed daily seed — no
//!   live beacon), then their recorded playthroughs are ingested (UNTRUSTED) into the surface;
//! - `GET /descent/leaderboard` ranks only the runs that RE-VERIFY to the hoard on render — the
//!   honest winner appears, a forged run and a lost run do NOT (non-vacuous exclusion);
//! - `GET /descent/run/{id}` re-executes the recorded run: an honest run (won or lost) shows PASS,
//!   a tampered run shows FAIL — the verification is INDEPENDENT (re-execution, not a stored flag);
//! - a different day's seed yields a different board.
