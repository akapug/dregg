//! **The driven MULTI-OFFERING web catalog — three heterogeneous offerings, in the browser.**
//!
//! The single-offering `driven.rs` proved ONE offering plays over the web. This proves the
//! frontend-agnostic [`OfferingHost`] lifted to the core: the web catalog registers THREE distinct
//! offerings (a dungeon, a council, a market — heterogeneous `Session` types, one registry) and
//! plays each in the browser through the SAME `open/advance/render/verify` verbs, with NO real
//! network (axum `ServiceExt::oneshot`) and NO Discord:
//! - `GET /offerings` lists all three;
//! - a full winning DUNGEON line plays through `/offerings/dungeon/...` (POSTs land real turns);
//! - a COUNCIL propose → vote (2 members) → enact plays through `/offerings/council/...`;
//! - a MARKET list → sealed bids → settle clears through `/offerings/market/...`;
//! - `verify` holds for each committed chain.
