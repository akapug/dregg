//! # dreggnet-names — a NAMESERVICE [`Offering`].
//!
//! The dungeon is offering #0 (a confined narrative). THIS crate proves the
//! [`Offering`] abstraction reaches **identity / naming**: register / transfer /
//! resolve a name, each an executor-refereed turn, over the REAL naming substrate.
//!
//! ## What it wraps (no naming logic re-implemented)
//!
//! The substrate is [`starbridge_nameservice`]'s **per-name sovereign cell**: a name
//! string maps (deterministically) to its own cell carrying
//! [`starbridge_nameservice::name_cell_program`] —
//! `WriteOnce(NAME_HASH)` (the **first-claim** tooth: a name can be bound exactly
//! once, from zero), `Monotonic(EXPIRY)`, `WriteOnce(REVOKED)`, and the F1..F7
//! **owner-authorization caveats** (an owner-mutating write is a real executor
//! refusal unless the turn's `ctx.sender` IS the current owner). The signed turns are
//! the crate's own builders ([`starbridge_nameservice::build_register_action`] /
//! [`starbridge_nameservice::build_transfer_action`] /
//! [`starbridge_nameservice::build_accept_transfer_action`]). This offering only
//! ORCHESTRATES them through the real [`EmbeddedExecutor`].
//!
//! ## The one real design choice: distinct signers over ONE ledger
//!
//! The owner-auth caveats compare `ctx.sender` — which the executor binds to the
//! **action's own signer pubkey** — against the name cell's owner register. To make
//! that a genuine cross-actor identity (Alice ≠ Bob ≠ Carol), each enrolled actor
//! gets its OWN [`AppCipherclerk`] and its OWN [`EmbeddedExecutor`] (so its per-agent
//! nonce tracks correctly), all sharing ONE [`Ledger`] via
//! [`AgentRuntime::with_ledger`]. A name registered by Alice is therefore visible when
//! Bob tries to seize it — and the executor refuses Bob, admits Alice.
//!
//! ## The mapping onto [`Offering`]
//!
//! - `open` — a fresh registry session (an empty shared ledger; enroll actors with
//!   [`NamesSession::enroll`]).
//! - `advance(action, actor)` —
//!   - **register** (`turn = "register"`, name in `label`): claim a free name → a real
//!     [`TurnReceipt`]; a TAKEN name is `Refused` by `WriteOnce(NAME_HASH)`.
//!   - **transfer** (`turn = "transfer"`, name in `label`, recipient = enrolled index
//!     in `arg`): the current owner re-owners the name (propose + accept, two real
//!     turns) → `Landed`; a NON-owner is `Refused` by the owner-auth caveats.
//!   - **resolve** (`turn = "resolve"`, name in `label`): a real turn that emits a
//!     `name-resolved` receipt anchored on the name cell, carrying the committed owner.
//! - `verify` — re-drive the recorded op-log against a FRESH substrate ([`NamesSession::replay`]);
//!   the names re-resolve to their owners and a forged claim (a duplicate register, a
//!   non-owner transfer) fails replay at the same executor teeth.
//! - `render` / `actions` — the registered names + the register/transfer/resolve
//!   affordances as a deos [`Surface`].
//! - `price` — the free tier (the substrate turn is always free + verifiable).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! This wraps the per-name sovereign cell (the `FactoryDescriptor` federation face of
//! the substrate). `resolve` is modelled as a receipt-emitting turn anchored on the
//! name cell; the substrate's `service` module marks resolve as a *serviced* OFE read
//! (the committed `name → owner` field IS the answer) — [`NamesSession::resolve_owner`]
//! exposes that committed read directly. A FULLER nameservice adds expiry-driven
//! reclaim (the `Monotonic(EXPIRY)` + `renew` machinery already lives in the substrate),
//! subdomains / hierarchical delegation, auctions for premium names, and reverse
//! resolution (owner → names) — none of which this offering exercises.
