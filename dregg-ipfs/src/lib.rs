//! `dregg-ipfs` — the IPFS bridge: **a dregg content commitment is an IPFS CID.**
//!
//! (Ported dregg-native from the retired operated layer's `dregg-ipfs` crate; the
//! verified core is unchanged.)
//!
//! dregg already content-addresses everything it stores and serves: a hosted site
//! and a storage bucket are dregg cells with a committed content root over
//! content-addressed assets/objects (`storage::bucket_commitment`), and the
//! offchain merge runtime's deltas are content-addressed by a 32-byte blake3 id
//! (`dregg-merge`). IPFS is content-addressed too — and, crucially, **IPFS CIDs
//! carry a blake3 multihash**. So a dregg blake3 content commitment, re-encoded
//! with the blake3 multicodec under a CIDv1, simply *is* the content's IPFS
//! address. No bridge hashing, no second identity.
//!
//! That alignment makes IPFS a natural backing for these dregg surfaces:
//!
//! - **storage / hosting** — pin object/asset bytes on IPFS, commit the CID in the
//!   cell. The bytes are then served from *any* node or gateway, not just the edge,
//!   and a visitor re-witnesses them against the CID (content-addressing) AND the
//!   dregg receipt (the cell commits the CID, owner-signed) — verify-don't-trust over
//!   a decentralized transport.
//! - **the merge runtime** — distribute the I-confluent `dregg-merge` deltas (a
//!   content-addressed grow-set, the Merkle-CRDT shape) over IPFS, the natural
//!   transport for content-addressed deltas.
//!
//! ## What is in this crate
//!
//! - [`cid`] — the CID alignment: [`Cid`] (CIDv1 encode/decode, plus legacy CIDv0
//!   `Qm…` parse for interop), [`Cid::raw_blake3`] (a blob's CID = its blake3
//!   commitment), [`Cid::from_blake3_digest`] (wrap an existing dregg blake3
//!   commitment, no re-hash). base32 decoding is canonical-strict so CID parsing is
//!   injective.
//! - [`client`] — the injected transport seam [`IpfsClient`], the in-process
//!   [`MockIpfs`], and the real network clients over an injected [`HttpPost`]
//!   (method-verb + header aware): [`KuboClient`] (Kubo RPC add/block/pin),
//!   [`GatewayClient`] (a trustless-gateway `?format=raw` block read that composes with
//!   the verified fetch), and [`PinningServiceClient`] (the IPFS Pinning Service API,
//!   the durability layer). [`StdHttpPost`] is a std-only local transport with
//!   timeouts (no TLS).
//! - [`unixfs`] — **chunked content**: a UnixFS/dag-pb file DAG builder
//!   ([`build_file_dag`] / [`pin_file`]) and the verified DAG-walk read
//!   ([`fetch_cat`]) that re-witnesses every block against its own CID. Closes the
//!   single-block-only hole.
//! - [`bridge`] — [`pin_blob`] (single-block, size-guarded) / [`fetch_verified`] (the
//!   trustless flat fetch) / [`fetch_authorized`] (both halves in code: the
//!   owner-receipt [`ReceiptCheck`] AND content-addressing) / [`delta_cid`].
//!
//! ## Real here vs reviewed-go (honest)
//!
//! Real + tested in-process: the CID↔commitment bridge (incl. strict base32 + CIDv0
//! parse), the `IpfsClient` seam, the `MockIpfs` round-trip + tamper-refusal, the
//! UnixFS chunker + verified DAG walk (multi-level round-trip, tamper + missing-block
//! refusal), the receipt-composed [`fetch_authorized`], and the network clients' RPC
//! formatting (Kubo add/get/pin/block-put, gateway raw read, pinning-service add) —
//! each exercised over a recording transport. Reviewed-go (ops, not code): a *live*
//! round-trip against a running daemon / gateway / pinning provider, TLS (supplied by
//! an injected reqwest transport), and **byte-exact CID parity** with a live `ipfs
//! add`'s default chunker/layout (this builder emits a valid, self-consistent,
//! fully-verifiable blake3 UnixFS DAG that [`fetch_cat`] round-trips; matching
//! go-ipfs's exact block boundaries is a deployment-time concern behind the same seam).
