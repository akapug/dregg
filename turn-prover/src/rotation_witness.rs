//! `rotation_witness` — the per-turn ROTATION **producers** (Group A of the
//! turn-prover extraction).
//!
//! These are the minting recipes that take a REAL executed turn's before/after
//! `dregg_cell::Cell`s, drive [`dregg_turn::rotation_witness::produce`] over them
//! to derive each rotated block witness (`pre_limbs` + `iroot`), run the wide
//! full-cohort trace dispatcher, and PROVE the result — returning a
//! `dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_aggregation::RotatedParticipantLeg` (or, for
//! the wrap adapter, an `ivc_turn_chain::FinalizedTurn`).
//!
//! # Why they live here and not in `dregg-turn`
//!
//! Everything below calls into `dregg-circuit-prove` (the recursion substrate).
//! Core `dregg-turn` is the wasm/zkvm card and the seL4 verifier-PD floor: it
//! keeps the *derivation* (`produce`, `cells_root`, `iroot`, `wire_commit_8`,
//! `sender_membership_teeth`) and the executor's rotated VERIFY leg, and links no
//! prove crate at all. The producers ride `dregg-turn`'s PUBLIC interface only —
//! `rotation_witness::{produce, RotationWitness, empty_revoked_root_8,
//! sender_membership_teeth}` plus the `umem` projection module — so this move
//! exposed no new internals.
//!
//! Until PR3 these were `#[cfg(feature = "prover")]` inside `dregg-turn`, i.e.
//! type-checked only in whichever build happened to select the arm. Here they are
//! compiled unconditionally, so a shape change in `dregg-circuit-prove`'s leg
//! constructors is a compile error at the source.

/// **THE ROTATED-LEG MINTING RECIPE (Bucket-F / PATH-PRESERVE Phase 5a).** Build a
/// [`RotatedParticipantLeg`](dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_aggregation::RotatedParticipantLeg) for a
/// single homogeneous-cohort turn from the real before/after actor `Cell`s: run [`produce`] over
/// each cell to derive its rotated block witness (`pre_limbs` + `iroot`), then drive the wide
/// full-cohort dispatcher (`generate_rotated_effect_vm_descriptor_and_trace_wide`) over them —
/// threading the BEFORE cell's producer-honest membership teeth — and prove the result through
/// the IR-v2 batch prover under the leaf-wrap config (so the minted `Ir2BatchProof` folds
/// directly as a `NativeBatchStark` recursion leaf). The proof self-verifies natively before
/// return. (An earlier `RotatedParticipantLeg::mint_from_block_witnesses` "pure-circuit core"
/// duplicated this body WITHOUT the membership-teeth threading and had zero callers — a drifted
/// mirror, deleted 2026-07-17; this recipe is the one real mint.)
///
/// This lives in `dregg-turn` (NOT `dregg-circuit`) because it drives [`produce`] over
/// `dregg_cell::Cell`s, and `dregg-circuit` cannot depend on `dregg-cell` / `dregg-turn` (a
/// dependency cycle — both depend on `dregg-circuit`). It is the ONE recipe the recursion
/// consumers (lightclient / wasm / `circuit/tests/proof_economics.rs`) use to build a mandatory
/// rotated participant; it mirrors `circuit/tests/rotation_batchstark_leaf_smoke.rs`'s mint
/// sequence exactly.
///
/// The leg publishes whatever `TURN_HASH` the wide producer carried, and there is deliberately
/// NO caller override. The slot is FOUR felts (`canonical_32_to_felts_4`) at every reader
/// (`dregg_verifier::check_receipt_pi_binding`, `sdk::verify_full_turn_bound`,
/// `turn::conditional::verify_effect_vm_proof_against_condition`); the `Option<BabyBear>`
/// shared-turn-id knob this recipe used to take wrote ONE felt and left three zero, minting a leg
/// every one of those readers refuses. It was unreachable, and the census is exhaustive: this
/// recipe had **28** call sites, 27 passing the literal `None` and the 28th being
/// [`finalized_turn_from_full_turn`] forwarding its own parameter — whose own **3** call sites
/// (`node::turn_proving`'s finalized-turn retention, plus two SDK tests) also all passed `None`.
/// Same for the four welded/custom minters in `dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_aggregation`:
/// **12** call sites, every one `None`. So the write `dpis[TURN_HASH_BASE] = tid` never executed
/// anywhere, and the knob is DELETED rather than widened. A joint-turn shared identity threads a
/// `[BabyBear; 4]`, not a felt.
///
/// ⚠ Counting note, because it cost a wrong claim once: `ast-grep`'s `f($$$)` matches a bare-name
/// call and **NOT** a path-qualified `a::b::f($$$)`, and it does not descend into `assert!(…)`
/// macro bodies. Five call sites hid in exactly those two blind spots. Cross-check a call census
/// with `grep`, or the count is a floor rather than a total.
///
/// ## The post-regen registry TAIL (v12 exposure regen)
///
/// The committed wide registry row a member proves against may demand MORE PIs (and trace
/// columns) than the per-family wide producer emits: the v12 big-bang regen made the committed
/// transfer row the membership-teeth member (`CarrierComposed.transferV3MembershipWide` — 2
/// `(sender_leaf, authorized_root)` claim PIs spliced AHEAD of the 16 wide anchors, 2 teeth
/// columns past the carriers). The tail derivation is SHARED: it lives IN the wide dispatcher
/// (`generate_rotated_effect_vm_descriptor_and_trace_wide` — derived from the descriptor, never
/// a hardcoded count, fail-closed on a tail it has no producer fill for), so every route emits
/// the committed shape. This recipe's contribution is the producer-honest teeth VALUES from the
/// BEFORE cell (`sender_membership_teeth` — `compress_member` over the cell's owner key + the
/// declared `SenderAuthorized { PublicRoot }` root slot; a cell declaring no such caveat passes
/// the ZERO form, exactly the no-caveat sentinel the fold's membership arm refuses to bind).
///
/// Fails closed if the turn's effect is not a single rotated R=24 cohort member (the generator
/// rejects a non-cohort / empty / heterogeneous slice).

/// ## Why this is a re-prove, not a byte-reuse

/// The node's `FullTurnProof` (`node::turn_proving`) is a COMPOSED multi-sub-proof STARK proven
/// under the SDK verify config; its rotated effect-vm leg lives inside a

/// [`ir2_leaf_wrap_config`](dregg_circuit_prove::ivc_turn_chain::ir2_leaf_wrap_config)
/// (log_blowup 6). The two are DIFFERENT FRI-engine instantiations of the SAME constraint set, so
/// the composed leg's bytes cannot be dropped into the fold. The SOUND bridge (the same
/// statement-equality argument [`dregg_turn::rotation_witness`]'s leaf wrap already rests on) re-proves
/// the IDENTICAL rotated descriptor over the IDENTICAL trace + PI vector under the leaf-wrap
/// config, from the SAME execution context the node marshalled for its `FullTurnProof`.
///
/// ## The faithfulness tie (fail-closed)
///
/// A re-prove is only a faithful bridge if it attests the SAME state transition the served
/// `FullTurnProof` proved. The node's `ProvenFinalizedTurn` carries the proof's 8-felt (~124-bit)
/// `(old_commit, new_commit)` anchors (`node::turn_proving::prove_and_verify_finalized_turn` reads
/// them off the rotated leg's `wide_commit_anchors`). This adapter takes those anchors and REFUSES
/// unless the freshly minted wrap leg publishes the SAME wide 8-felt anchors at its PI tail
/// (`wide_old_root8` / `wide_new_root8`). So the `FinalizedTurn` this returns cannot silently
/// attest a DIFFERENT transition than the node's served proof — a context that does not match the
/// `FullTurnProof` fails closed here rather than folding a mismatched turn into the wrap. The
/// chain's temporal tooth (`new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`) then binds these SAME anchors across the
/// fold.
///
/// `initial_state` / `effects` / `before_cell` / `after_cell` / `nullifier_root` /
