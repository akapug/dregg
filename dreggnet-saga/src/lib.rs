//! # `dreggnet-saga` — the WEAVE that proves the game-infra crates COMPOSE.
//!
//! Eight feature crates (party / quest / craft / cheevo / trade / faction / guild /
//! tavern) each ship, each individually excellent, each built in ISOLATION. This crate
//! is the enmeshment proof: a **driven end-to-end saga** that threads ONE player through
//! the features as a continuous story, each step a real committed turn feeding the next,
//! where one crate's OUTPUT type IS the next crate's INPUT type on the shared substrate.
//!
//! ## The two shared currencies of composition
//!
//! The whole "do they compose?" question reduces to: is the object one crate hands off
//! the SAME object the next crate consumes, or a re-derived look-alike? The saga proves
//! object-identity along the two spines the substrate was designed around:
//!
//! * **The `ugc_dregg::Completion` — the run currency.** A quest completion, a Descent
//!   run, a tournament result are all one `Completion` (a `Playthrough` + a claimed
//!   turns-to-win, verified against a `Universe`). The saga records ONE `Completion` and
//!   passes the SAME `&Completion` (and the SAME `&Universe`) by reference to
//!   [`dreggnet_cheevo::CheevoLedger::earn`] AND
//!   [`dreggnet_guild::leaderboard::GuildBoard::record_clear`]. quest -> cheevo -> guild
//!   is object-identical: nobody re-derives the run.
//! * **The `dreggnet_asset::AssetId` — the item currency.** A crafted output, a traded
//!   item, a loot drop are all one owned note addressed by a stable content id. The saga
//!   forges an output in [`dreggnet_craft`], and the SAME 32-byte `AssetId` is the one a
//!   [`dreggnet_trade`] swap moves and the one the new owner's provenance-verify names.
//!
//! ## The chain the saga drives (each `->` is a real cross-crate handoff)
//!
//! 1. a **party** musters (`dreggnet-party`) — four seated roles, each cap = its mandate;
//! 2. a **faction** gate stands between the party and the quest-giver (`dreggnet-faction`)
//!    — a player with no Ember standing is REFUSED entry to the sanctum where the giver
//!    waits, so a faction-locked player cannot start the quest; earning rep opens it;
//! 3. the **quest** is run and turned in (`dreggnet-quest`) — a replay-verified receipt,
//!    which the saga records as one `ugc_dregg::Completion`;
//! 4. that Completion **earns a cheevo** (`dreggnet-cheevo`) — a soulbound asset over the
//!    run's real trajectory;
//! 5. the guild **sums the same clear** (`dreggnet-guild`) — the identical Completion,
//!    counted into the guild's un-forgeable aggregate;
//! 6. the quest's material drops are **forged** into an item (`dreggnet-craft`) — inputs
//!    spent on-chain, one owned output note;
//! 7. that item is **traded** to a buyer (`dreggnet-trade`) — an atomic escrow swap; the
//!    buyer verifies the item's provenance by the SAME AssetId.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — object-identity end-to-end (the reconciliations, applied)
//!
//! The saga assessment named four additive reconciliations to tighten the weave from
//! label-matched to object-identical. Three are now DONE (additive API tweaks, no
//! redesign); the fourth is a deliberately-named follow-up:
//!
//! * **quest -> cheevo -> guild: OBJECT-IDENTICAL.** One `Universe` and one `Completion`,
//!   passed by reference to both consumers. The cheevo anchors and the guild counts the
//!   very same run object. The strongest handoff in the weave, unchanged.
//! * **craft -> trade -> buyer: OBJECT-IDENTICAL AT THE NOTE-CELL (reconciliation #1,
//!   done).** [`dreggnet_craft::CraftForge::into_assets`] (and `assets_mut`) hands the
//!   forge's live `AssetWorld` to [`dreggnet_trade::TradeWorld::with_assets`], so the trade
//!   moves the EXACT crafted note with NO re-mint. The crafted output's provenance lineage
//!   CONTINUES across the trade — mint(craft) -> escrow -> buyer, length growing 1 -> 3 in
//!   ONE ledger — rather than restarting a same-id look-alike in a second world. The
//!   `AssetId` byte-identity still holds (a reproducible content address); the note-ledger
//!   is now shared, so the handoff is object-identical at the note-cell, not just the id.
//! * **faction -> quest: THE FACTION REP CELL GATES THE QUEST-GIVER (reconciliation #2,
//!   done).** [`dreggnet_quest::giver::FactionGatedGiverWorld`] points the giver's cross-cell
//!   `ObservedFieldEquals` at a faction-standing cell's `ember_quest` slot (mirroring
//!   [`dreggnet_faction`]'s `FieldGte(rep_embers, `[`dreggnet_faction::REP_THRESHOLD`]`)`-gated
//!   `WriteOnce` unlock, re-homed onto the shared executor ledger). The quest-giver's start
//!   opens ONLY on real faction standing: a no-rep grant fails closed; earning rep opens it.
//!   The giver reads the faction cell, not a separate quest flag.
//! * **ONE IDENTITY across the crates (reconciliation #3, done).** [`PlayerIdentity`] is a
//!   small adapter deriving ONE canonical player into all three key representations:
//!   `dreggnet-party`'s ed25519 `Custodian` seat key, `dreggnet-guild`'s `DreggIdentity`
//!   member handle, and the asset layer's per-label `Holder` key (craft / trade / cheevo).
//!   One object is a party seat, a guild member, AND an asset holder — present across the
//!   crates as a single identity, not three look-alikes stitched by name convention.
//! * **`dreggnet-tavern` graduation is a NAMED follow-up (reconciliation #4, not built).**
//!   Tavern pulls `dregg-node`/deos-host (mozjs), is async, and needs an `_exit(0)` to dodge
//!   a SpiderMonkey teardown SIGSEGV — pulling that elephant into the saga's synchronous
//!   driven test would make the green gate heavy and flaky. Presence is proven in
//!   `dreggnet-tavern`'s own e2e; the saga runs on the light substrate. The real
//!   reconciliation the tavern's own honest-scope names: its inline party-roster /
//!   market-stall cells should GRADUATE to `dreggnet-party` / `dreggnet-trade` (the crates
//!   the saga threads). Named here, deliberately not pulled into the saga.
//!
//! ## Assessment
//!
//! They compose EXCELLENTLY and now OBJECT-IDENTICALLY along every spine but the deliberately
//! deferred one: the run (`Completion`) flows by reference quest -> cheevo -> guild; the item
//! (the crafted NOTE, not just its `AssetId`) flows in one shared ledger craft -> trade ->
//! buyer with a continuous provenance lineage; the faction rep cell gates the quest-giver
//! through a real cross-cell executor predicate; and one `PlayerIdentity` is the party seat,
//! the guild member, and the asset holder at once. Every gate is a real executor refusal, not
//! a host `if`. The three applied reconciliations were additive API tweaks — the objects
//! already lined up. The tavern graduation (which pulls mozjs/async) is the one named,
//! un-pulled follow-up.
//!
//! The driven saga lives in `#[cfg(test)] mod saga`; run it with
//! `cargo test -p dreggnet-saga`.
