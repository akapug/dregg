//! `settle_ledger` — a **durable**, restart-surviving record of settled
//! `(lease, period)` keys, so the real settlement rail
//! ([`NodeApiSettlement`](crate::node_api::NodeApiSettlement)) is exactly-once
//! across a process restart (or a second settler instance sharing the path), not
//! merely exactly-once in-memory.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (red-team LEASE-3)
//!
//! The settlement dedup was an in-memory `Mutex<HashMap<(lease,period), …>>`. A
//! settler restart (a crash, a redeploy, a second instance) starts with an EMPTY
//! map, so it re-settles every `(lease, period)` it is handed again — each as a
//! fresh **real on-chain `Transfer`**, double-charging the lessee. The on-chain
//! `memo` (`dreggnet-settle:<lease>:<period>`) was only "auditable" — nothing
//! enforced it before submitting the next transfer.
//!
//! This ledger closes that: it persists each settled key to disk and is consulted
//! **before** a transfer is submitted. A reservation is written **write-ahead**
//! (before the on-chain submit), so the property the rail upholds is
//! **at-most-once on-chain submission per `(lease, period)` across any number of
//! restarts**:
//!
//! - a key already present (this process OR a prior process's persisted file) is
//!   **replayed** — no second transfer is submitted;
//! - a fresh key is persisted+fsync'd before the submit, so a crash anywhere after
//!   the reservation leaves the key marked and a restart will NOT resubmit.
//!
//! The safe direction is deliberate: a settlement that crashed between the
//! write-ahead reservation and the on-chain commit is treated as already-settled
//! (it may be an operator-reconciliation item — under-charge, never double-charge).
//! This is exactly the security property LEASE-3 demands. The strongest
//! cross-live-instance form is a database unique constraint on `(lease, period)`
//! (the `dreggnet_meter` pg outbox already carries one); this file-backed ledger is
//! the dependency-light form that makes a **restart** provably non-double-charging.
//!
//! ## Format
//!
//! Append-only JSON lines, one [`SettleRecord`] per line. A reservation appends a
//! record with `turn_hash: null`; a confirmation appends the same key with the
//! on-chain turn hash + post-transfer balances. On load, the **last** record for a
//! key wins, so a confirmed record supersedes its reservation.
