//! The **account identity** — the stable, key-derived id a DreggNet cap-account
//! is anchored to (the Tier-1 re-anchor of `docs/ACCOUNT-IDENTITY-WELD.md`).
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before the weld, a DreggNet account's subject was `hash(credential tail)`
//! ([`crate::subject_of`]'s legacy path): the subject was a function of the
//! *credential*, so a new credential was a new account — no rotation, no
//! recovery, no revocation that preserved the account. The fix (per
//! `docs/deos/SESSION-LOGIN.md` §2.2) is to anchor the account to a
//! **self-certifying, key-derived identity-cell id** and demote the `dga1_`
//! credential to a *session token* under it.
//!
//! ## The id IS the substrate identity-cell id
//!
//! We do not invent a derivation: the account id is
//! [`dregg_types::CellId::derive_raw`]`(&inception_pubkey, &`[`ACCOUNT_ROOT_TOKEN`]`)`
//! — the exact `blake3::derive_key("dregg-cell-id-v1", pubkey ‖ token)` the
//! breadstuffs executor uses to address a cell. So a DreggNet account and the
//! rotatable substrate **identity cell** the control plane provisions for it
//! (KERI pre-rotation via `KeyRotationGate`, guardian recovery via the HINTS
//! `ThresholdSigVerifier`) are the *same principal* — byte-for-byte. This is the
//! depend-on-the-real-substrate weld: rotation/recovery happen on the identity
//! cell, and because the account subject IS that cell's id, the account (and all
//! the resources `org`/`dregg-secrets`/`console`/`guard`/`billing` scope to it)
//! survives every rotation.
//!
//! ## The INCEPTION key, not the current key (the KERI invariant)
//!
//! The id is derived from the account's **inception** public key — the first key
//! it was created with — and is then *fixed for life*. Key rotation changes the
//! *current* authoritative key (the one a session is minted under) but NEVER the
//! inception-derived id, exactly as a KERI AID is its inception id and continuity
//! is carried by the rotation chain (the KEL), not by re-deriving from the
//! current key. Deriving from the current key would change the id on every
//! rotation and defeat the entire purpose.
