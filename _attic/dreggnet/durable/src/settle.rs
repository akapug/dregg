//! `settle` — the metering→**Payable** fold: turn the durable meter into a
//! conserving, exactly-once value flow (the dregg `Payable` rail, modelled).
//!
//! ## Where this sits (the three ledgers, folded into one)
//!
//! A leased durable run touches three quantities; this module is where they are
//! made coherent rather than three independent counters:
//!
//! ```text
//!   lease budget   (the RESERVE)  — `budget_units` the funded lease proves was paid in.
//!     └─ durable meter (the TICK) — each step's `MeterTick` charges `per_period_units`
//!        │                          against the reserve; an over-budget tick fails the
//!        │                          workflow BEFORE it commits (lapse → reap). The
//!        │                          per-(lease,period) charge rows are the meter outbox.
//!        └─ Payable settle (PAY)  — THIS module: each metered period is settled as one
//!                                   conserving transfer lessee → provider, EXACTLY-ONCE
//!                                   keyed by `(lease, period)`. The settled total equals
//!                                   the metered total, which is ≤ the reserve.
//! ```
//!
//! The invariant the fold upholds (and the tests prove): for any lease,
//! `Σ settled(period) == Σ metered(period) ≤ budget`, and **every transfer
//! conserves** (the payer is debited exactly what the beneficiary is credited, so
//! the per-asset Σδ = 0 — the dregg value model). Re-running a period (a crash
//! re-dispatch, a daemon re-poll) settles nothing new: the `(lease, period)` key
//! is the idempotency key, so the meter is exactly-once (duroxide replay / the pg
//! outbox `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and the settlement is exactly-once (the
//! [`Settlement`] dedup below), and the two never double-count each other.
//!
//! ## What is real vs the named dregg wire
//!
//! - **Real (this module, offline, tested):** the conserving [`ConservingLedger`]
//!   — a per-`(asset, holder)` `i64` balance ledger (the substrate's *own* signed-
//!   `i64` balance epoch, not a foreign representation) whose [`Settlement::settle`]
//!   moves value lessee → provider and is idempotent per `(lease, period)`. Its
//!   **conserving move is no longer hand-rolled**: the debit/credit goes through
//!   [`crate::conserve::apply_conserving_transfer`], the kernel `Effect::Transfer`
//!   paired-delta law. In the **`dregg-conserve`** lane that primitive runs the move
//!   through the substrate's *proven* `dregg_cell::CellState` signed-balance
//!   discipline — the deployed Rust home of `recTransfer_balanceSum_conserve`
//!   (`metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/RecordKernel.lean`) / the apex `conservation_guarantee`
//!   (`AssuranceCase.lean`) — so the cloud's Σδ = 0 **points at the proven theorem**,
//!   not at the three local unit tests that previously stood in for it
//!   (`docs/SOUNDNESS-TWINS-CENSUS.md` #1). With the lane off, the same paired-delta
//!   is computed inline (a labelled mirror the lane's test gauntlet cross-checks),
//!   keeping the default build Apache-pure and `dregg-circuit`-free.
//! - **The named dregg wire (the remaining S3 seam):** breadstuffs' `dregg-payable`
//!   `Payable.pay(asset, amount, to)` desugars to ONE kernel `Effect::Transfer` (a
//!   `LinearityClass::Conservative` effect — per-asset Σδ = 0, checked across the
//!   app boundary). The fully-real settlement makes each [`LeaseCharge`] one
//!   `pay(asset, amount, provider)` whose receipt a light client witnesses
//!   **on-chain, in-circuit** — that on-chain/in-circuit half is the swarm's S3 flip
//!   (see [`crate::verified::S3_GATED_SEAM`]). The seam is exactly
//!   [`Settlement::settle`] — the orchestrator calls it identically over either
//!   backend. (The `dregg-conserve` lane is off-by-default like the bridge's
//!   `dregg-verify` lane and the `pg-dregg` verified-store lane, because the
//!   conservation primitive is welded to `dregg-circuit` in every substrate carrier
//!   — see [`crate::conserve`] for why a lane and not an unconditional dependency.)
//! - **The pg fold:** [`settle_meter_outbox`] (feature `pg`) reads the
//!   [`read_meter_outbox`](crate::read_meter_outbox) rows a durable run committed
//!   and settles each through a [`Settlement`] — the literal "the `Payable`
//!   settlement reads the `dreggnet_meter` outbox" path the meter docs name.
