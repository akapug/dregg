//! **The injection-free leg as a REAL descriptor-prover STARK** — the first zkOracle conjunct that
//! is *proven*, not just re-executed, now carried by the plonky3 IR-v2 descriptor prover
//! (`dregg_circuit::descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2`) instead of the legacy hand STARK engine.
//!
//! The injection check IS a DFA run (the `neg`-complement matcher, [`crate::injection`]), and dregg
//! deploys a DFA-classification descriptor: the `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` running-hash carrier, emitted
//! FROM Lean as an `EffectVmDescriptor2` (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/DfaRoutingGeneralEmit.lean`,
//! `injectionRoutingDesc`, byte-pinned by its `#guard`). This module welds the two: the injection
//! DFA as an explicit transition table, its run over the field bytes proven by the general
//! descriptor prover, the whole trace bound to the pinned table commitment + a route commitment by
//! the descriptor's Poseidon2 running-hash chip.
//!
//! Why a DEDICATED descriptor (not `DfaRoutingEmit`'s `dfaRoutingDesc`): that descriptor hardcodes
//! the TOGGLE transition (`step(s,y) = s XOR y`) as its arithmetic gate. The injection automaton is
//! a DIFFERENT machine — three states `clean=0 / brace=1 / dead=2`, recognizing `{{` in its
//! absorbing DEAD state — so it carries its OWN routing descriptor over the SAME carrier
//! (`injectionRoutingDesc`): identical entry-hash chip, running-hash chip, copy-forward accumulator,
//! continuity/seed/boundary skeleton; only the STATE grid (`{0,1,2}`) and the TRANSITION interpolant
//! (the injection `step` table's unique bivariate interpolant) differ.
//!
//! What the proof states (public inputs `[initial, final, table_commit, route_commit]`):
//! *the unique run of the pinned injection DFA over the committed symbol sequence ends in
//! `final`* — and the verifier accepts iff `final` is a non-injecting state. Today the
//! field is DISCLOSED (it is a committed span of the authenticated body), so the verifier
//! re-derives the expected route commitment from the field itself; the proof adds a
//! machine-checkable run bound to a pinned policy table. The HIDING upgrade — a private
//! field whose route commitment is welded to the body's content commitment instead of
//! re-derived — is the named next slice (`ZKORACLE-PROVER-STATUS.md`).
//!
//! HONEST BOUNDARY: the run is over the field's PADDED brace-projection (`{` vs other,
//! self-loop-padded to a power of two), so brace-free fields within one padding block
//! share one run and the proof transfers among them — but the transfer can never cross
//! the accept/reject boundary (the dead state is absorbing; padding preserves it).
//! Binding the field BYTES to the authenticated response is the attestation's span weld
//! (`FieldSpan` within the committed body), not this leg — the leg proves the POLICY RUN.
//!
//! Soundness of the table itself: [`injection_dfa_table`] is differential-tested against
//! the VERIFIED derivative matcher (`injection_free`, dregg-dfa's boolean-closed `Re` —
//! the Rust twin of `ZkOracle.lean`'s `.neg injectionTemplate`) — two independent
//! implementations, one truth.
