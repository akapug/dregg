//! **The zkOracle capstone** — the 3-leg attestation + verifier, mirroring
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/ZkOracle.lean::zkOracle_sound`.
//!
//! ```lean
//! theorem zkOracle_sound … :
//!     (∃ w, Deco.DecoRelation … decoStmt w) ∧          -- authentic
//!     body ∈ jsonGrammar.language ∧                     -- well-formed
//!     InjectionFree field                               -- injection-free
//! ```
//!
//! A [`ZkOracleAttestation`] carries all three legs' evidence; [`verify_zkoracle`]
//! is the Rust realization of the composition: it ACCEPTS iff all three verify, and
//! refuses (with the failing leg named) otherwise.
//!
//! ## The cross-leg weld — ONE committed response, not three independent objects
//!
//! Verifying the three legs is not enough: they must be about the SAME request. A
//! [`content_commitment`] — a Poseidon2 sponge over the **authenticated response body**
//! (the SAME `hash_bytes` primitive the content-root uses) — is threaded across all three:
//!
//! - **authentic** yields the response body; the verifier recomputes its commitment and
//!   refuses any attestation whose committed value disagrees ([`ZkOracleError::CrossLegMismatch`]);
//! - **well-formed** checks its certificate against that same authenticated body;
//! - **injection-free** runs over a committed SUBSTRING of that same authenticated body
//!   ([`FieldSpan`]) — the user field is extracted from the authenticated bytes, NOT a
//!   free-standing input a splicer could swap.
//!
//! So a spliced attestation (a well-formed cert / an injection-free field about body A
//! stapled onto an authentic session for body B) is REFUSED — the legs are bound to ONE
//! response. This is the 3-way analogue of the DECO body-binding in `bridge::stripe_deco`.
