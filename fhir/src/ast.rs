//! The fhIR-0 product/order AST — the front-end the compiler type-checks.
//!
//! A [`Product`] is a name, a body (one of the fhIR-0 product forms), and an
//! OPTIONAL tier *claim*. The claim is how a product author states the privacy
//! they promise: `None` means "infer and report the most-private honest tier";
//! `Some(t)` means "I promise tier `t`", and the compiler REJECTS the product if
//! the math does not deliver at least that privacy (`compile::compile`). This is
//! the mechanized honest-labeling discipline of `DREGGFI-PRIVACY-TIERS.md` §2/§3
//! — the type system, not marketing, decides the privacy label.
