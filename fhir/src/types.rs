//! The type system — a product's TYPE and the admissibility judgment.
//!
//! In fhIR a product's type carries three things
//! (`FHEGG-PRODUCT-ORDER-FRONTIER.md` headline; `DREGGFI-PRIVACY-TIERS.md` §3):
//!
//! 1. the **convex-program shape** ([`ProgramType`]) — its curvature, its
//!    matrices each flagged PUBLIC or PRIVATE, its cones, its size, and any
//!    integer/disjunctive features;
//! 2. the **tier** it is admissible at ([`crate::tier::Tier`]);
//! 3. the **certificate kind** ([`CertKind`]) it compiles to.
//!
//! The typing rule ([`ProgramType::admissible_at`]) is the load-bearing content:
//!
//! > A product type-checks at tier `T` iff its convex-program shape is
//! > `T`-tractable — and the operative boundary is **the matrices, not the
//! > curvature**: the cheap (Dark/FHE) regime needs the constraint/objective
//! > matrices PUBLIC (the FHE matvec is a linear combination with public scalars
//! > over encrypted data — a private matrix destroys the public-matvec
//! > advantage, `PRIVATE-CONVEX-ENGINE.md` precision-correction #4).
//!
//! **Honest scope.** [`ProgramType::admissible_at`] realizes the admissibility
//! *direction* only — **compiles ⇒ runnable at that tier**. The full
//! "admissible **iff** it compiles" is the six-part theorem
//! (`FHEGG-PRODUCT-ORDER-FRONTIER.md`), a NAMED research target for the Lean
//! lane, NOT discharged here. fhIR-0 is the type-checker; the theorem is the
//! target it is being built to justify.
