//! GENESIS-FROM-SNAPSHOT — carry a cell-set across an EPOCH bump.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! A devnet re-genesis today is a **WIPE**: `node/src/genesis.rs` mints fresh
//! committee keys → a fresh `federation_id` → a brand-new chain, and
//! `deploy/genesis/generate.sh --force` deletes the old `genesis.json` and keys.
//! Every character, leaderboard, and universe minted on the old chain is gone.
//!
//! The vat-migration design (`plans/vat-migration-design.md`) already specifies a
//! `CellExportBundle` — a cell carried FROM one federation TO another with an IVC
//! proof of its history-from-genesis and a state-commitment binding, so the target
//! can install it without trusting the source. That primitive is **cross-federation**.
//! This crate **generalizes it to cross-EPOCH**: the "source federation" is the OLD
//! chain (committee epoch N), the "destination federation" is the FRESH GENESIS
//! (epoch N+1). A re-genesis can then SEED the new chain with a frozen EXPORT of the
//! old cell-set instead of wiping it.
//!
//! ```text
//!   OLD chain (epoch N)                         FRESH genesis (epoch N+1)
//!   ───────────────────                         ─────────────────────────
//!   mint new committee keys ── new fed id ─────▶ (destination federation id)
//!   FREEZE + EXPORT cell-set:                    IMPORT / SEED:
//!     per cell:                                    per entry, REFUSE unless
//!       · full Cell                                  · id re-addresses identically
//!       · content-address (CellId)                     (verify_id_integrity)
//!       · cross-epoch MigrationVoucher              · voucher binds this exact state
//!         (from = old fed, to = new fed)               (from/to + state_commitment)
//!       · IVC proof of history-from-old-genesis    · IVC history verifies AND its
//!                                                      final root binds THIS cell
//!                                                 ⇒ carried-forward cells re-address
//!                                                    IDENTICALLY, history validated.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the imported cell re-addresses identically
//!
//! A cell's identity is `CellId = derive_raw(public_key, token_id)` — a pure
//! content-address, independent of which federation or epoch hosts it. So an
//! honestly-carried cell, dropped into the fresh genesis, recomputes to the SAME
//! `CellId`. [`seed_genesis`] re-checks this ([`SnapshotEntry`] integrity) and
//! refuses any entry whose declared address does not match its recomputed one.
//!
//! ## What is refused on import (non-vacuous tamper rejection)
//!
//! * A **forged cell** (e.g. a balance bumped after freeze) changes the cell's
//!   `state_commitment`, which breaks BOTH the migration voucher binding
//!   ([`EntryReject::VoucherMismatch`]) and the IVC history's final-root binding
//!   ([`EntryReject::HistoryStateMismatch`]).
//! * A **broken history proof** (a flipped accumulated hash / trace commitment)
//!   fails [`dregg_circuit::ivc::verify_ivc`] → [`EntryReject::HistoryInvalid`].
//! * A cell whose **content-address does not recompute** → [`EntryReject::AddressMismatch`]
//!   / [`EntryReject::IdentityBroken`].
//! * A snapshot minted for a **different destination epoch** → [`ImportError::WrongDestination`].
//!
//! The honest cell in every one of these pairs imports cleanly, so the rejection
//! is non-vacuous.
//!
//! ## HONEST SCOPE
//!
//! * **Real**: the export/import carry-forward, the content-address re-addressing
//!   stability, and the layered history/state-commitment validation on import.
//! * **NAMED CAVEAT — the unsound fold.** The IVC history leg is a real
//!   [`dregg_circuit::ivc::IvcProof`] built with the real prover/verifier over a
//!   real fold chain — BUT the vat-migration story it generalizes leans on a
//!   **bridge fold that the project flags UNSOUND** (see memory
//!   `project-carrier-deployment-architecture` / `project-universal-fold-buff-lightclient`).
//!   The history proof here models the cell's turn history as a chain of fold
//!   deltas (a modeled stand-in for the real per-turn state-transition witnesses);
//!   the *chain structure* (linkage, ordering, endpoint binding) is sound, but the
//!   soundness of the history leg as a whole inherits that flagged fold. The
//!   state-commitment voucher binding is an independent, unconditional second check.
//! * **Deploy wiring** (NOT built here): threading [`GenesisSnapshot::export`] into a
//!   node's freeze path and [`seed_genesis`] into `node/src/genesis.rs` /
//!   `deploy/genesis/generate.sh` so a live re-genesis reads a snapshot file. This
//!   crate is the additive primitive; the operator wiring is a separate deploy step.
