//! GUARD C — the anti-illusion test: the TOY seams are not on any deployed path, and this is
//! precisely which primitives remain CRATE-AUTHORITATIVE.
//!
//! # What changed (and why this file was rewritten)
//!
//! This test used to assert something broader and now FALSE: that "the deployed sign/KEM paths are
//! crate-authoritative". That was true when the only Lean seams for sign/KEM were TOY-scoped. It is
//! no longer true. `dregg-pq` now carries REAL, full-byte cores for three of the four operations,
//! and every archive-linked host installs them at startup:
//!
//!   * ML-DSA-65 VERIFY  — `install_verified_mldsa_verify_core`   (node, SDK, starbridge-v2, drorb)
//!   * ML-DSA-65 SIGN    — `install_verified_mldsa_sign_core_real` (node, SDK, starbridge-v2, drorb)
//!   * ML-KEM-768 KEM    — `install_verified_mlkem_{encaps,decaps}_core` (node, drorb)
//!
//! On an installed host `MlDsaKey::try_sign` PRODUCES its bytes from the extracted Lean
//! `MlDsaSignReal.signCore` and never calls `fips204` at all — observed under gdb in the drorb
//! dataplane, where a breakpoint on `dregg_fips204_sign_real_str` fires on every sign while one on
//! `fips204::ml_dsa::sign_internal::<false, 6, 5, 48, 3309, 4032, 768>` never fires.
//!
//! # What this test still proves, and it is worth proving
//!
//! The TOY seams (`install_lean_sign_core`, `install_lean_encaps_core`, `install_lean_decaps_core`)
//! carry SCALAR (n=1) / bit-`m` reductions, and NOTHING deployed consults them. They are easy to
//! mistake for the real ones — the names differ by a `_real` suffix. So the assertions below install
//! the toy seams with a POISON payload and drive the real deployed fns: if any deployed path ever
//! got wired to a toy seam, this test breaks loudly.
//!
//! # What remains CRATE-AUTHORITATIVE (the honest residual)
//!
//! 1. **KEYGEN, both algorithms.** `MlDsaKey::from_ed25519_seed` calls `fips204`'s
//!    `ml_dsa_65::KG::keygen_from_seed`, and `ml_kem768_keygen` calls `ml-kem`'s
//!    `MlKem768::generate`. There is no verified keygen core and — note this — NO audit-gate guard
//!    on either, so keygen does not abort and does not announce itself. This is the largest
//!    remaining unaudited surface in this crate.
//! 2. **The classical halves.** Ed25519 (`ed25519-dalek`) and X25519 (`x25519-dalek`).
//! 3. **The combiner.** The X-Wing concat-KDF is Rust `hkdf`/`sha2`, not a verified object.
//! 4. **Any host that never installs.** A process that skips the installs still has `fips204` /
//!    `ml-kem` behind sign/verify/KEM — but since the audit gate landed it ABORTS on first use
//!    rather than substituting silently. That is the gate's whole job.
//!
//! ★ Anything asserted here is about THIS test binary, which by construction cannot link the 546 MB
//! Lean archive and therefore always runs the crate fallback. That is a property of the test
//! binary, NOT a description of a deployed process. The deployed routing is proven where the
//! archive is actually linked: `drorb crates/dataplane/src/pq.rs`
//! (`verified_sign_core_is_the_deployed_sign_authority`) and `node/tests/mldsa_live_sign.rs`.
