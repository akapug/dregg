//! GUARD C — the anti-illusion test: SIGN and KEM are still CRATE-AUTHORITATIVE in every deployed process.
//!
//! `dregg-pq` exposes three Lean-verify SEAMS that mirror the verify-side one — `install_lean_sign_core`,
//! `install_lean_encaps_core`, `install_lean_decaps_core`. Unlike the verify seam (which the node installs
//! and which `ml_dsa_verify` genuinely routes through — see `tests/mldsa_lean_verify.rs`), these three are
//! TOY-SCOPED: the installed objects are the SCALAR (n=1) `signCore` / bit-`m` `encapsCore`/`decapsCore`,
//! and NOTHING deployed consults them. The deployed byte-level signer (`MlDsaKey::sign` /
//! `ml_dsa_sign_from_seed`) uses the `fips204` crate directly; the deployed hybrid KEM
//! (`hybrid_kem::initiate` / `HybridResponder::finish`) uses the `ml-kem` + `x25519-dalek` crates directly.
//!
//! This test DOCUMENTS-IN-CODE that the deployed sign/KEM paths do NOT route through the toy seams — so no
//! reader can be left with the false impression that they behave like the verify seam. If someone later
//! wires the deployed signer/KEM through these seams, THIS test breaks, forcing the honest-scope comments in
//! `dregg-pq/src/{mldsa,hybrid_kem}.rs` to be updated in the same breath.
//!
//! The assertions are BEHAVIORAL (the strongest form the audit asked for): we install the toy seams with a
//! POISON payload, then drive the real deployed fns and assert their output is a CRATE-VALID cryptographic
//! object that the poison seam could never have produced. NOTE: ML-DSA signing is HEDGED (randomized via
//! `OsRng` — see `fips204::traits::try_sign`), and the hybrid handshake draws fresh ephemeral keys per run,
//! so byte-equality across calls is NOT the right invariant. The right invariant is that the deployed output
//! stays a valid, full-size crate object (verifies / round-trips) with a poison seam installed — which it
//! could not if the seam were on the deployed path. No leanc/FFI link is needed for the assertions
//! themselves — the toy seams are pure Rust closures.
