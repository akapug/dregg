//! BRICK 8 — the FINALE gate: prove the DEPLOYED `dregg_pq::ml_dsa_verify` routes its
//! security-critical accept/reject through the Lean-verified REAL ML-DSA-65 verify core
//! (`Dregg2.Crypto.Fips204Verify.verifyRealFFI` over `MlDsaVerifyReal.verifyCore`, run as leanc-native
//! code via `dregg_lean_ffi::shadow_fips204_verify_real`), NOT the `fips204` crate.
//!
//! The core is installed here (a dev-dep on `dregg-lean-ffi` links the archive — the shipping `dregg-pq`
//! leaf never does). We then exercise `ml_dsa_verify` over a GENUINE `fips204` keypair+signature:
//!   * the honest signature ACCEPTS,
//!   * a one-byte-tampered signature REJECTS,
//!   * a wrong message REJECTS,
//! and the Lean-backed verdict AGREES with the crate's own `PublicKey::verify` on all three — so the swap
//! is behavior-preserving while the AUTHORITY has moved to the verified Lean object.
//!
//! If the leanc/FFI link is absent (a stale archive missing the export), this test FAILS LOUDLY at the
//! `fips204_verify_real_core_available` assertion rather than silently exercising the crate fallback.

    // The authority UNDER TEST here is the Lean-verified REAL verify core: it is installed
    // below, its availability is ASSERTED (not assumed), and every accept/reject verdict
    // this test checks comes from it. What the `fips204` crate is used for is producing the
    // GENUINE keypair + signature that the Lean core is then asked to judge, and serving as
    // the differential oracle its verdict is compared against. That is the whole point of
    // the test — a Lean verify that only ever saw Lean-produced signatures would prove
    // nothing about real-world ones — so the crate is the SUBJECT here, never the authority.
    //
    // The SIGN path is what trips the gate (`MlDsaKey::sign` below), and it is deliberately
    // left on the crate. Note this is not merely a test artifact: `install_verified_mldsa_
    // sign_core_real` has exactly ONE caller in either tree (`node/src/lib.rs`), so most
    // processes still sign with the unaudited crate. See §P.4 of the drorb crypto-TCB ledger.
    //
    // SAFETY: set before this process performs any PQ operation. Test binaries run each
    // integration-test file in its own process, and `install_core()` is the first statement
    // of every test in this file, so no other thread can be mid-operation.
