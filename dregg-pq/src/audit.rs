//! Refusal gate for the UNAUDITED post-quantum fallback path.
//!
//! # The hole this closes
//!
//! `dregg-pq` is a LIGHT leaf: it never links the 546 MB Lean archive. The
//! Lean-verified ML-DSA / ML-KEM cores are INJECTED as `fn` pointers by a host
//! that *can* link it (see `install_verified_mldsa_verify_core` and friends).
//! Until such a host installs them, every operation in this crate is answered by
//! the `fips204` 0.4 / `ml-kem` 0.2.3 RustCrypto crates — which are NOT audited
//! and are NOT the proven objects this project's assurance claims rest on.
//!
//! That fallback used to be SILENT. The failure mode it produced is the worst
//! one available to us: nothing errors, every signature still verifies, every
//! handshake still completes, the build is green — and the accept/reject
//! authority in the deployed binary is code nobody audited. It is reached by
//! ordinary accidents, not by sabotage:
//!
//!   * the git-tracked `dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a` seed exports ZERO of the
//!     three PQ cores (`nm`-established), so a FRESH CLONE takes this path;
//!   * `dregg-lean-ffi`'s build script degrades to that seed on a `lake build`
//!     failure, a `leanc` failure, or a splice failure — each reported only as a
//!     `cargo:warning=`, which cargo hides for dependency build scripts;
//!   * a host binary that simply never calls the install functions.
//!
//! In all three the process runs unaudited crypto with no signal at all.
//!
//! # The mechanism, and why this one
//!
//! Reaching an unaudited primitive is FATAL unless the operator has explicitly
//! accepted it by setting `DREGG_ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ=1`.
//!
//! * **Why not fail the build/link?** Impossible in principle *here*. `dregg-pq`
//!   does not link the archive; whether a host will install verified cores is
//!   unknowable at this crate's compile time. The build-time half of this gate
//!   therefore lives where the archive IS linked — `dregg-lean-ffi`'s build
//!   script, which nm-probes the final archive for the three core exports and
//!   fails the build when they are missing. The two halves are complementary:
//!   that one catches a bad ARTIFACT, this one catches a host that never
//!   installed (or a call that beat the install).
//!
//! * **Why `abort()` and not `panic!`?** A panic is CATCHABLE, and in exactly the
//!   deployed shape we care about it gets swallowed: a `tokio` task panic kills
//!   only that task, so a serving node would log one backtrace per request and
//!   keep answering — quiet substitution restored, with extra steps. Likewise
//!   `catch_unwind`, and `panic = "abort"` is not something a leaf can assume.
//!   `process::abort()` cannot be caught, cannot be unwound past, and cannot be
//!   swallowed by a task boundary. The message goes to stderr directly (not
//!   through `log`/`tracing`, which may be unconfigured or filtered at startup).
//!
//! * **Why an env opt-in rather than unconditional refusal?** An unconditional
//!   refusal would break legitimate work that has no verified core available and
//!   does not claim assurance: this crate's own fallback unit tests, differential
//!   KATs that deliberately drive the crate path, and non-PQ / marshal-only
//!   builds. The opt-in keeps those possible while making the DEFAULT the safe
//!   one — absence of the variable is fatal, so nobody reaches unaudited crypto
//!   by inaction. Opting in is a deliberate, greppable, auditable act that also
//!   prints a warning on first use.

         No verified core is installed in this process, so this operation would have\n\
         been answered by a primitive that is NOT part of the audited, proven TCB.\n\
         Rather than substitute it silently, the process is aborting.\n\
         \n\
         LIKELY CAUSE (in descending order of how often it is the real one):\n\
           1. The linked libdregg_lean.a does not EXPORT the verified PQ cores. The\n\
              git-tracked dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a seed exports ZERO of them;\n\
              a correct archive is produced by dregg-lean-ffi's build script. Check:\n\
                nm -g --defined-only <archive> | grep dregg_fips204_verify_real\n\
           2. dregg-lean-ffi's build script degraded to that seed (a `lake build`,\n\
              `leanc`, or archive-splice failure). Cargo HIDES dependency build-script\n\
              warnings; re-run with `cargo build -vv` to see them.\n\
           3. This binary never calls the install functions at startup.\n\
         \n\
         TO PROCEED ANYWAY (accepting UNAUDITED crypto, and forfeiting every assurance\n\
         claim that depends on the verified cores) set:\n\
           {ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ_ENV}=1\n\
         Do NOT set it in production, in a validator, or in anything whose output is\n\
         presented as verified.\n\
