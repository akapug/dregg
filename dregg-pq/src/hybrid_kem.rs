//! A **hybrid** (classical + post-quantum) session key-exchange, so a recorded
//! session is not *harvest-now-decrypt-later* (HNDL) vulnerable: an adversary
//! who records the handshake today and acquires a quantum computer later still
//! cannot recover the session key.
//!
//! The classical transport seals each frame with X25519 ECDH → HKDF-SHA256 →
//! ChaCha20-Poly1305. That protects against a *classical* adversary but not a
//! future quantum one, because X25519 (a discrete-log problem) falls to Shor's
//! algorithm. This module adds the missing half: a session KEM whose derived
//! key depends on **both** an X25519 secret **and** an ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203)
//! secret.
//!
//! ## The combiner (the load-bearing correctness point)
//!
//! We follow the published **X-Wing** / TLS **X25519MLKEM768** hybrid-KEM
//! construction: derive one classical secret `ss_x25519` and one post-quantum
//! secret `ss_mlkem`, then feed **both, concatenated, plus the full public
//! transcript** through a single KDF:
//!
//! ```text
//! session_key = HKDF-SHA256(
//!     salt = DOMAIN,
//!     ikm  = ss_x25519 ‖ ss_mlkem,
//!     info = DOMAIN ‖ transcript )
//! ```
//!
//! This is a **concatenation KDF, never XOR**: with XOR an adversary who learns
//! one secret could cancel it and forge agreement on the other; with a
//! collision-resistant KDF over the *concatenation* the output depends jointly
//! and inextricably on both. Consequently breaking X25519 alone (quantum) does
//! not recover the key — `ss_mlkem` still protects it — and breaking ML-KEM
//! alone does not either — `ss_x25519` protects it. That two-sided dependence is
//! exactly what the `hybrid_dependence_*` tests pin.
//!
//! The `transcript` binds the derived key to the exact public handshake material
//! (both X25519 public keys, the ML-KEM encapsulation key, and the ML-KEM
//! ciphertext), so an active attacker cannot substitute ephemeral material
//! without changing the key — the same transcript binding X-Wing performs over
//! `ct_X ‖ pk_X`.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! One round trip. The **responder** publishes a [`HybridOffer`] (its X25519
//! ephemeral public key + its ML-KEM encapsulation key) and keeps the matching
//! [`HybridResponder`] secrets. The **initiator** consumes the offer with
//! [`initiate`], producing a [`HybridInitiatorMessage`] (its X25519 ephemeral
//! public key + the ML-KEM ciphertext) and *its* copy of the session key. The
//! responder feeds that message to [`HybridResponder::finish`] to derive the
//! *same* session key. Confidentiality only: this is a KEM, there is no enroll /
//! pin / signature here (peer authentication rides the existing identity/handoff
//! layer).
//!
//! ## `kem` traits
//!
//! ml-kem 0.2.3 re-exports the `Encapsulate`/`Decapsulate` traits its encaps /
//! decaps are built on via its own `ml_kem::kem` module, so this module imports
//! them from `ml_kem::kem` and never names the pinned pre-release `kem` crate.
