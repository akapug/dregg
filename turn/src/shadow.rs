//! The post-commit observer SEAM — dependency inversion that keeps `dregg-turn` FFI-free.
//!
//! The verified-Lean executor cluster lives in the native-only `dregg-exec-lean` crate, which
//! links `libdregg_lean.a`. `dregg-turn` itself must NOT link the Lean archive (it is the crate
//! a wasm / no-FFI build composes), so the executor's production path reaches it through this
//! trait rather than the FFI directly.
//!
//! [`TurnExecutor`](crate::executor::TurnExecutor) holds an
//! `Arc<dyn ShadowObserver>`. A native node injects `dregg_exec_lean::LeanShadowObserver`;
//! every other construction defaults to [`NoOpShadowObserver`], which does nothing.
//!
//! ⚑ **THE DIFFERENTIAL IS NO LONGER HERE — 2026-07-30.** Until this date the trait also carried
//! `enabled()` and `capture_pre_state()`, driving a Lean↔Rust differential gated on
//! `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1`. That variable was set by NOTHING in the tree outside one test (swept
//! four ways), so the differential never ran on a deployed node; and its verdict was discarded at
//! the single call site (`let _ = maybe_shadow_turn(..)`), so it could not decide anything even
//! armed. Its one genuine strength — a CELL-BY-CELL Lean↔Rust post-state comparison — was moved
//! onto the seam that IS armed (`dregg_exec_lean::lean_apply::produce_via_lean`, default-ON via
//! `DREGG_LEAN_PRODUCER`), where it now decides `ProducerOutcome`'s `divergence` field, and the
//! dark path was deleted rather than kept alongside it.
//!
//! What survives here is what the observer actually *does* on a live node: advance
//! observer-owned cross-turn accumulators after a committed turn (the durable nullifier
//! frontier). That is a real side effect on the production path, not a diagnostic.
//!
//! [`ShadowHostCtx`] is pure data (only `CellId`, no FFI), so it lives here in `dregg-turn`;
//! the verified producer reads it (via `TurnExecutor::build_shadow_host_ctx`) to drive the
//! verified gate.

/// The HOST/NODE-fed admission context (boundary-P1 bug-1). These come from the EXECUTOR's own

/// decided by the node, exactly as `admissible` reads `AdmCtx`. The production node (and the
/// in-process executor) builds this from `self.block_height` / `self.cell_migrations` (frozen) /
/// `self.get_last_receipt_hash(agent)` (stored head) / `self.budget_gate.remaining()` (budget).
///
/// Defaults (via [`ShadowHostCtx::diag`]) are the DIAGNOSTIC values that never spuriously reject

///
/// # The host obligation (Lean: `Dregg2.Exec.HostCorrespondence`, AssuranceCase seam §2)
///
/// The verified gate's conditional soundness lemma `admissible_sound_of_reflects` proves: IF this
/// context FAITHFULLY REFLECTS the node's true runtime facts (`HostFacts`: true clock / freeze-set /
/// stored head / budget) THEN the gate decides EXACTLY as the node's own state would. The teeth
/// (`{stored_head,budget,freeze,clock}_obligation_teeth`) show each field is load-bearing: an unsafe
/// under-report (omit a truly-frozen referenced cell, advance the head to a forked turn's `prev`,
/// inflate the budget, retard the clock) ADMITS a turn the true-facts gate REJECTS. So the production
/// executor MUST override every field below from its own `self` state — never `diag()`. The only
/// residual is producer-coverage: every cell the freeze gate reads (agent + write-set) must get a
/// wire id; the `frozen` projection here is faithful on exactly those read cells
/// (`marshalled_admission_sound`).
///
/// ⚑ **AND "OVERRIDE FROM `self`" IS NOT THE WHOLE OBLIGATION — the CARRIER has to be as wide as
/// the fact.** `Reflects` is `ctx.storedHead = H.trueStoredHead`, and until 2026-08-06 an executor
/// that overrode this field perfectly from its own state still failed that equation: the
/// marshaller narrowed `stored_head` (and the turn's claimed `prev`) to their low 64 bits, because
/// `WireHostCtx::stored_head` was a `u64`. So `admissible_sound_of_reflects` and
/// `reflects_rejects_true_fork` were true and did not apply to the running node, and a chain head
/// agreeing with the true one on 8 of 32 bytes was ADMITTED — at a cost of one XOR, since
/// `Turn::previous_receipt_hash` is agent-supplied and need not be any receipt's hash. Closed by
/// widening the carrier (`dregg-lean-ffi`'s `WireHostCtx::stored_head` / `WireTurnHdr::prev_hash`,
/// the `_w` no-copy builders in `Dregg2/Exec/FFIDirect.lean`); pinned by
