//! ConditionalTurn: STARK-conditional cross-domain atomic execution with timeout abort.
//!
//! A ConditionalTurn is a turn submitted to a federation that does NOT execute until
//! a proof satisfying its condition is presented. If the proof doesn't arrive before
//! the timeout height, the turn expires (no state change, no fee charged).
//!
//! This enables cross-federation atomicity:
//! - Fed A commits: "Turn T_A executes IFF proof P_B arrives before height H"
//! - Fed B commits: "Turn T_B executes IFF proof P_A arrives before height H"
//! - If both proofs arrive -> both execute (atomic success)
//! - If either times out -> both revert (atomic failure)
//!
//! The STARK proof replaces the HTLC hash preimage, but is strictly more general:
//! any provable statement can serve as a condition, not just "know a preimage."
