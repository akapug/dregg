//! Derive an action's `balance_change` from its emitted effects.
//!
//! Per DESIGN-dsl.md §5: rather than the user writing
//! `.balance_change(delta)` on the builder (and getting it wrong, as the
//! gallery audit found), the framework computes the delta from the
//! `Transfer` / `NoteSpend` / `NoteCreate` / `CreateEscrow` effects
//! emitted by the action, summed from the perspective of the caller.
