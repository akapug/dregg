//! SYMBOLIC EXECUTION — a runtime witness mode + a collapse orchestrator.
//!
//! # The thesis
//!
//! A turn's *state transition* (balances / capabilities / nonces) is the
//! `AbstractState = (balanceTotal, authGraph)` progress proved witness-FREE in
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Spec/ExecRefinement.lean` (`Exec ⊑ Abstract`). The
//! *witness layer* — the per-turn `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash` Merkle
//! commitments folded into the receipt — is a SEPARATE, derivable artifact: it
//! is what a remote light client needs to be convinced, NOT what the local
//! state transition needs to *happen*.
//!
//! [`WitnessMode::Symbolic`] exploits that split. A symbolic turn applies the
//! full state transition (the abstract progress) but DEFERS witness
//! materialization: it does not compute the state anchor
//! (`crate::state_commit`, the AIR-bound chip 8-felt commitment), so its receipt carries a
//! DEFERRED sentinel post/pre state hash ([`DEFERRED_STATE_HASH`], all-zeros,
//! which the conditional/atomic paths already tolerate). The witnesses are
//! recovered ON DEMAND by [`collapse`], which re-runs the recorded symbolic
//! turns through FULL execution to reproduce EXACTLY what a Full run would have
//! witnessed.
//!
//! # Soundness — what stays invariant
//!
//! Symbolic mode defers only the WITNESS, never a DECISION:
//!
//! * **Full is the correct default.** [`WitnessMode::default`] is `Full`. A
//!   caller opts into `Symbolic` explicitly, for local/unpublishable work.
//! * **Admission gates are NOT deferred.** Every legality gate — the
//!   `NoteSpend` STARK, committed-note conservation, the sovereign-witness
//!   check, authority/no-amplification, nonce/fee — runs IDENTICALLY in both
//!   modes. Symbolic skips computing the Merkle *root*; it never skips the
//!   *decision* a turn's legality rests on. A turn that is rejected in Full is
//!   rejected in Symbolic, at the same action, for the same reason.
//! * **Symbolic state is local / unpublishable.** A receipt carrying
//!   [`DEFERRED_STATE_HASH`] is not a network artifact: it has no usable
//!   commitment to publish to a light client. Publishing requires
//!   [`collapse`], the ONLY witness path.
//! * **Collapse reproduces Full.** Determinism is already discharged (the
//!   pinned timestamp + cost model + the recorded post-root tooth), so
//!   re-running a recorded turn under Full re-derives the byte-identical
//!   receipt a Full run would have produced. [`collapse`] asserts this against
//!   the recorded post-root teeth.
//!
//! # What is deferred (and what is not, yet)
//!
//! The DOMINANT per-turn witness cost is the ledger Merkle `Ledger::root()`
//! materialization (O(k·log N) over the touched cells, or an O(N) rebuild on a
//! structural change) folded into `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash`. That is
//! what Symbolic defers, on both the live engine receipt AND the replay-tape
//! double-execution (the World skips `History::record_commit` and buffers the
//! turn).
//!
//! NOT yet deferred: the per-cell EXTENDED-FIELD / HEAP sub-roots
//! (`CellState::set_field_ext` / `set_heap` in the `cell` crate eagerly call
//! `compute_fields_root` / `compute_heap_root`). These fire only for
//! extended-key field writes and heap effects (not the common
//! transfer/cap/nonce path), and deferring them needs a `Ledger::Pending`-style
//! mark-dirty refactor of `CellState` with its own membership-witness
//! invariants — a `cell`-crate change out of this module's scope. Noted as a
//! follow-up; the ledger-root deferral is the headline saving.
//!
//! # The known architectural gap
//!
//! The *light-client semantics of a deferred-witness turn* are out of scope:
//! an un-collapsed symbolic receipt cannot convince a remote verifier (it has
//! no real commitment). That is by design — Symbolic is a LOCAL fast path, and
//! `collapse` is the bridge back to publishable witnesses. A turn must be
//! collapsed before its receipt crosses the publish boundary.
