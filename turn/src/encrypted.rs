//! Encrypted turn: a turn whose content is hidden from the federation during ordering.
//!
//! An `EncryptedTurn` bundles:
//! - The encrypted turn body (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
//! - A commitment to the plaintext turn (BLAKE3 hash)
//! - A conflict set (Bloom filter over accessed cells) — **submitter-declared and
//!   unverified**; see the named seam on [`EncryptedTurn::verify_admission_binding`]
//! - A [`TurnValidityProof`] which, at HEAD, carries submitter AUTHENTICATION and an
//!   EMPTY `proof_bytes` — there is no validity STARK in the tree
//!
//! The federation orders encrypted turns by:
//! 1. Checking admission: [`EncryptedTurn::verify_admission_binding`] (an Ed25519
//!    signature by the key controlling the claimed `agent`, over the public inputs) and
//!    [`EncryptedTurn::check_claims_against_agent_cell`] (the signed `claimed_nonce` equals
//!    the agent cell's nonce, and its balance covers the signed `min_fee`). After
//!    decryption, [`EncryptedTurn::check_decrypted_turn_against_claims`] refuses a turn whose
//!    `nonce`/`fee` differ from what the envelope claimed. What stays open is proving the
//!    claim↔content binding BEFORE decryption, in zero knowledge — the Phase-2 STARK, which
//!    is named, not built.
//! 2. Detecting conflicts via Bloom filter overlap — on the filter the SUBMITTER declared.
//! 3. Serializing conflicting turns, parallelizing non-conflicting ones.
//!
//! After ordering is finalized, the turn is revealed (either by the agent publishing
//! the decryption key, or via threshold decryption by the validator set).
//!
//! # Cryptography
//!
//! `EncryptedTurn::encrypt_for_executor(turn, recipient_pub)`:
//! - generates a fresh X25519 ephemeral keypair,
//! - performs X25519 DH with the executor's public key,
//! - derives a 32-byte ChaCha20-Poly1305 key via BLAKE3-derive_key,
//! - encrypts `serde_json::to_vec(turn)` with a fresh 12-byte nonce,
//! - records both `ephemeral_public` and `nonce` in the struct so the
//!   executor can later DH + decrypt with its static unsealer key.
//!
//! The `turn_commitment` is computed over the plaintext bytes so the
//! validator can also bind the proof to the same commit pre-encryption, and
//! the executor can verify post-decryption that the decrypted bytes hash to
//! the same commitment.
//!
//! # Why JSON here?
//!
//! Historically `Turn` carried `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "…")]` fields,
//! which broke positional formats (postcard/bincode): a skipped field is not
//! written on serialize but still read on deserialize, desyncing the byte
//! stream ("Found an Option discriminant that wasn't 0 or 1"). Those skips have
//! since been removed (every `Turn`/`Action` field is now always serialized),
//! so `Turn` round-trips through postcard. This envelope stays on JSON for
//! schema stability of the encrypted ciphertext; it could move to postcard now
//! that the underlying `Turn` schema is positional-safe. (See
//! `tests::privacy_wiring::encrypted_turn_decrypts_to_original`.)
