//! **THE consensus state anchor** — the AIR-bound chip 8-felt commitment that a
//! receipt chains, an executor signs, and a federation quorum certifies.
//!
//! # What this replaced, and why
//!
//! Until this module landed, `TurnReceipt::{pre,post}_state_hash` carried
//! [`dregg_cell::Ledger::root`] — a hand-written BLAKE3 Merkle tree over the
//! ledger's cells. That value is **trusted Rust**: no AIR constrains it, no
//! circuit ever recomputes it, and the object chained/signed/gossiped as "the
//! state" was therefore attested by a witness generator with zero proof
//! obligation (assurance-perimeter inventory #1/#2).
//!
//! There *is* a genuine dual-hash architecture in this tree — see the ADR in
//! `dregg_commit::hash`: BLAKE3 for non-ZK paths (storage keys, gossip message
//! hashes, capability-token derivation, general-purpose Merkle commitments),
//! Poseidon2 for anything a circuit must recompute. The consensus ledger root
//! sat **outside** that ADR's stated scope while inheriting its hash: it is not
//! a fast path chosen over Poseidon2, it is the un-migrated remainder. The
//! lazy-materialization comment on `Ledger::root` justifies *when* to hash, not
//! *which* hash. BLAKE3 keeps every site the ADR actually covers; it loses the
//! consensus anchor.
//!
//! # What the anchor is
//!
//! [`consensus_state_commitment`] is
//! `felt8_to_bytes32(compute_canonical_state_commitment_v9_felt8(cell, ctx))` —
//! the **chip** 8-felt chain (`Faithful8::from_wire_commit_chip`), i.e. the same
//! value the deployed rotated EffectVM trace publishes as its wide `STATE_COMMIT`
//! carrier. ~124-bit collision resistance, an 8-felt carrier at every
//! intermediate step, no ~31-bit waist in the chain.
//!
//! ⚑ It is deliberately NOT `rotation_witness::wire_commit_8`: that helper calls
//! the plain [`dregg_circuit::Faithful8::from_wire_commit`], which **diverges**
//! from the deployed `wire_commit_8_chip` (no arity-tag seeding — see
//! `dregg_circuit::poseidon2`). Anchoring on the plain chain would produce a
//! commitment no honest wide proof's BEFORE carrier equals. The sovereign and
//! encrypted paths already anchor on the chip chain; this module makes the
//! classical path agree with them.
//!
//! # ⚑ THE RESIDUAL — read this before citing the anchor as "proven"
//!
//! Landing this does **not** close assurance-perimeter #2. Precisely:
//!
//! 1. **The flagship `⟺` theorems certify the 1-felt `wireCommitR`, not this
//!    8-felt chain.** `transferDescriptor_commit_iff` and its siblings are
//!    machine-checked against the ~31-bit `wire_commit`. The 8-felt value is
//!    **chip-bound and soundness-ADDITIVE** — it is the carrier the deployed
//!    trace publishes, which is strictly more binding than the 1-felt waist, but
//!    `air_accepts ⟺ spec` **at 8 felts** awaits the S2 flag-day plus an 8-felt
//!    re-derivation of the refinement. That re-derivation is itself gated on
//!    `Poseidon2WideCR` / `InjectiveFloorRegrounded`, which are **vacuous at real
//!    parameters** (a compressing hash HAS collisions; the named carrier is an
//!    assumption, not a discharge). So: the anchor is the *right object*, and it
//!    is *not yet a proven* one.
//! 2. **This is a per-cell / per-transition commit, NOT the whole-ledger
//!    snapshot `Ledger::root()` was.** A multi-cell turn has multiple legs and
//!    therefore multiple such commitments; this anchors the turn's *agent* leg.
//!    The whole-ledger 8-felt state root is the deferred `cells_root` Phase-E
//!    work. The consequence is visible in [`consensus_state_commitment`]'s
//!    contract: it binds the agent cell's own state faithfully and the rest of
//!    the ledger only through the `cells_root` *existence* fold (limb 0), which
//!    is a set-of-present-cells digest, not a state digest.
//! 3. **The lane-0 waist persists** wherever a narrow leg still broadcasts into
//!    slot 0 of a wide carrier. This anchor does not touch those sites.
//! 4. **Cost.** `Ledger::root()` was an incrementally-maintained O(log n) leaf
//!    patch. This anchor is O(n_cells) Poseidon2 for `cells_root` plus a
//!    `CanonicalHeapTree8` rebuild per accumulator, twice per turn (pre + post).
//!    That is a real regression on the hot path, taken deliberately: the node's
//!    `canonical_ledger_root` already pays O(n) BLAKE3 + postcard per finalized
//!    block, so this is not a new asymptotic class at the consensus boundary,
//!    but the executor did get slower. `executor::turn_profile`'s `pre_root` /
//!    `post_root` phases measure it.
//!
//! # What the quorum signs
//!
//! `TurnReceipt::receipt_hash` (domain `dregg-receipt-v4`) absorbs both
//! `pre_state_hash` and `post_state_hash`, so:
//!
//! * the **executor signature** (`executor-receipt-sig-v4`) signs the anchor;
//! * the **federation receipt QC** — a BLS threshold aggregate over
//!   `FederationReceiptBody::body_hash` (`dregg-fed-receipt-body-v2`) — is a
//!   genuine quorum certificate over the anchor;
//! * the **`AttestedRoot` quorum** binds `receipt_stream_root`, a Merkle root
//!   over `receipt_hash()`es, so the attestation signature transitively covers
//!   the anchor too.
//!
//! `AttestedRoot::merkle_root` and `FinalizationVote::merkle_root` deliberately
//! remain `dregg_persist::canonical_ledger_root` (BLAKE3): that value is the
//! **whole-image restart anchor** — a node re-reads its store, reconstructs the
//! ledger, and checks the reconstruction hashes to the quorum-signed root. No
//! per-cell algebraic commitment fills that role, and the whole-ledger 8-felt
//! that would is the deferred Phase-E `cells_root`. Those preimages are
//! domain-bumped so the *meaning* change is fenced, but the whole-image digest
//! itself stays BLAKE3 on a documented, non-circuit rationale.
