//! ADVERSARIAL: does the live executor's `CapTpDelivered` authorization gate admit an
//! AMPLIFYING / UNTRUSTED handoff that the verified Lean kernel (and the captp
//! `validate_handoff` swiss gate) reject?
//!
//! The Lean spec (`Dregg2.Exec.AuthModes`, lines 16-25) documents the suspicion verbatim:
//! "dregg1 currently FAILS to enforce `granted ≤ held` here (it verifies the two
//! signatures and the cert/target binding, but never re-checks that the cert's conferred
//! permissions attenuate what the introducer held)."
//!
//! The structural reality: the executor has NO swiss table — the introducer's authoritative
//! `held` record (the swiss entry) lives ONLY in the captp/wire layer, consulted ONLY by
//! `validate_handoff`. So the executor's image of "held" is the TARGET CELL's own declared
//! permission lattice: a CapTpDelivered cert short-circuits that lattice entirely. Two gaps:
//!
//!   (A) INTRODUCER-TRUST: `verify_captp_delivered` takes `introducer_pk` from the
//!       recipient-supplied turn and verifies the cert is signed by THAT key — but never
//!       checks the introducer is a TRUSTED federation. An adversary self-signs a cert.
//!   (B) NON-AMPLIFICATION: the cert short-circuits the target cell's permission lattice
//!       (`verify_authorization` returns Ok early), so the cert confers authority to perform
//!       ANY action on the target regardless of the cell's declared `AuthRequired` — without
//!       any `granted ≤ held` (here: granted ≤ the cell's required tier) check.
//!
//! This test fixes a Signature-LOCKED target cell, then has an UNTRUSTED adversary (its own
//! fresh keypair = the "introducer") self-sign a handoff cert naming itself recipient and
//! submit a CapTpDelivered turn that mutates the locked cell. If the executor COMMITS, the
//! hole is CONFIRMED. After the fix it must REJECT (the locked cell's lattice is honored /
//! the untrusted introducer is refused), while a LEGITIMATE attenuating handoff still passes.
