//! Plonky3 prove+verify driver for predicate bodies the runtime can encode
//! as a `CircuitDescriptor`.
//!
//! Strategy: for each requirement in the predicate body, we build a tiny
//! `CircuitDescriptor` whose constraints encode the requirement
//! algebraically, generate a witness trace by hand (the prover knows the
//! values from the IR-level inputs), then call
//! [`dregg_circuit::dsl::dsl_p3_air::prove_dsl_p3`] followed by
//! [`dregg_circuit::dsl::dsl_p3_air::verify_dsl_p3`] — the PRODUCTION interpreter.
//!
//! (Corrected 2026-07-17: this doc used to name `dregg_dsl_runtime::prove_dsl_plonky3` — the 868-line
//! DUPLICATE `DslP3Air` this harness once drove. The imports were migrated to production but the doc was
//! not; the duplicate is now DELETED. A harness that names the shadow it no longer drives is the mirror
//! lying about itself.)
//!
//! A successful round-trip means "the runtime Plonky3 verifier accepts
//! this requirement on these inputs." A panic during prove (the standard
//! way `p3_uni_stark::prove` rejects an invalid trace) or a
//! verifier-returns-`Ok(false)` is reported as Reject.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! - Inequalities (`<=`, `>=`) are encoded as a base-`2^16` limb decomposition of BOTH operands
//!   plus a borrow-chain subtraction, with a REAL bit-decomposition range check on every limb (see
//!   [`u64_le_descriptor`]). Rejection of a false claim is a property of the CONSTRAINTS — a false
//!   `smaller <= bigger` has NO satisfying assignment — not of the witness generator's good
//!   manners. This holds across the FULL u64 domain: no operand escapes to the oracle.
//!
//!   (Fixed 2026-07-17, `DslComparisonRangeSoundnessResidual`. This lowering used to carry a
//!   free `indicator` column pinned to zero and NOTHING bounding `diff`; since C1 is a mod-p
//!   subtraction, a prover claiming `5 <= 3` could witness `diff = (3 - 5) mod p = p - 2`,
//!   `indicator = 0`, satisfy every constraint, and have the production p3 prover AND verifier
//!   ACCEPT the false statement. The comparison's truth lived entirely in the honest witness
//!   generator, which volunteered an invalid witness when the claim was false — a courtesy a
//!   malicious prover simply declines. The old in-file comment "we cap the diffs to a 30-bit range
//!   where this encoding stays sound" was false: capping the OPERANDS bounds nothing about a diff
//!   column no constraint reads. The range check is now real, and the forgery is UNSAT — pinned as
//!   a rejection tooth in `tests/comparison_wrap_soundness.rs`.)
//!
//!   (Widened 2026-07-17, lane `dsl-2p30-fallback`. The fix above was sound only on `[0, 2^30)`;
//!   operands at or above `2^30` SHORT-CIRCUITED to `prove_trivial(ir_ok)` — no circuit built, the
//!   verdict IS the native-u64 oracle's own answer, i.e. exactly the generator's confession the
//!   paragraph above says is gone. That fallback is DELETED, not disclosed: the gadget is now
//!   limb-decomposed and sized to u64 exactly. [`u64_le_descriptor`] carries the arithmetic for why
//!   the single-element encoding could not simply be widened — `k = 30` was already the ceiling
//!   (`2^31 - 1 > p`), and `from_u64` aliases operands `>= p` regardless of the range check.)
//! - Equality (`==`) and non-equality (`!=`) on u64 reduce to `Equality`
//!   over two columns and a `ConditionalNonzero` respectively.
//!
//!   ⚠ **These two still carry the `2^30` oracle fallback that inequalities no longer do**, and it
//!   is load-bearing for them: `from_u64` aliases mod p, so without the cutoff `eq-u64` would
//!   ACCEPT the false claim `BABYBEAR_P == 0` (both embed to the zero column) and `neq-u64` would
//!   reject the true `BABYBEAR_P != 0`. The cutoff hides that rather than fixing it. The same limb
//!   machinery closes both (`Equality` per limb; `ConditionalNonzero` + `AtLeastOne` over per-limb
//!   difference flags), and `u64_to_limbs`/`u64_le_col` are already the parts. NOT done here —
//!   this lane's scope was the inequality path. Named so it is not read as closed:
//!   `DslEqualityOperandAliasingResidual`. The u64-domain teeth in
//!   `tests/comparison_wrap_soundness.rs` cover `<=`/`>=` only.
//! - Equality / non-equality on `[u8; 32]` are compared as 64-bit limb
//!   tuples (limb 0 — bytes 0..8); the comparison-side semantics still
//!   match the IR-level truth because the IR's bytes-equality requires
//!   full bytewise equality.
//! - Membership requirements need Poseidon2 hash gadgets which the runtime
//!   AIR cannot express. We mark these Skip.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Each requirement gets its own STARK proof. For the predicate suite this
//! means ~hundreds of small proofs. Plonky3's `p3_uni_stark` over BabyBear
//! is fast enough at this scale that the full crate runs in a few seconds.

//
// WHY LIMBS — the arithmetic that forced this shape (2026-07-17, lane dsl-2p30-fallback).
//
// The predecessor gadget ("diff-le") held both operands in ONE BabyBear column each and
// range-checked `diff = bigger - smaller` with a 30-bit decomposition. It was sound, but only
// for operands in `[0, 2^30)`; outside that it SHORT-CIRCUITED to the native-u64 oracle, so for
// `u64::MAX` and friends — common in the predicate suite — the "Plonky3 verdict" was the oracle's
// own answer with no circuit behind it.
//
// That path could NOT be closed by widening `DIFF_RANGE_BITS`. Two independent walls, both hard:
//
//  1. RECOMPOSITION WRAP. `k` boolean-pinned bits recompose to at most `2^k - 1`. The bound is
//     only meaningful while that maximum cannot itself wrap mod p, i.e. `2^k - 1 < p`. With
//     `p = 2^31 - 2^27 + 1 = 2013265921`: `2^30 - 1 = 1073741823 < p` (fits), but
//     `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 > p` (does NOT). So k = 30 was ALREADY THE MAXIMUM — not a
//     conservative choice, the ceiling. Even k = 31 breaks the no-wrap argument outright.
//  2. OPERAND ALIASING — the deeper wall. `BabyBear::from_u64(x)` reduces mod p, so for `x >= p`
//     the column does not hold `x` at all: `from_u64(u64::MAX) = 1172168162`, and
//     `from_u64(BABYBEAR_P) = 0`. C1 would subtract RESIDUES, not integers, and the PI binding
//     would publicly commit to the wrong number. No choice of `DIFF_RANGE_BITS` touches this —
//     it is the EMBEDDING, not the range check.
//
// So a single field element provably cannot carry a u64 operand. The fix is to stop asking it to:
// each operand is carried as `N_LIMBS` base-`2^LIMB_BITS` limbs, each limb small enough to embed
// injectively, and the comparison is done by a borrow chain across limbs. The field never has to
// hold a value it cannot represent, so the fallback has no reason to exist and is DELETED.

/// window that is `== 0 mod p` IS zero, so **the field equation B_j implies the INTEGER equation**.
/// That is the no-wrap argument, and unlike the predecessor's it has ~13 bits of headroom rather
/// than one.
///
/// ⚠ EVERY hypothesis of that argument is load-bearing, and the booleanity of `borrow(j)` is the
/// least obvious one. `borrow(j)` enters B_j multiplied by `2^16`, so a borrow allowed to be an
/// arbitrary field element is a licence to inject any multiple of `2^16` into the chain — enough to
/// buy back exactly `p` and land every difference limb honestly inside `[0, 2^16)`. It is not
/// hypothetical: `5 <= 3` is provable with `d_limb = [65535, 30719, 0, 0]` and
/// `borrow = [p - 30719, 0, 0, 0]`, since `65535 + 2 + 2^16 * 30719 = p`. That witness satisfies
/// every B_j, every range check, and F. Only `Binary { col: borrow(j) }` stops it. A mutation canary
/// confirmed the production prover AND verifier accept the forgery once that one constraint is
/// removed; it is pinned by
/// `tests/comparison_wrap_soundness.rs::non_boolean_borrow_cannot_buy_back_the_modulus`.
///
/// The integer equations are exactly base-`2^16` subtraction with borrow, so by induction on `j`
/// they compute `bigger - smaller` and `borrow(N_LIMBS - 1) = 1` iff `bigger < smaller`. F rules
/// that out — so the system is satisfiable IFF `smaller <= bigger` over the integers. A false claim
/// has NO satisfying assignment, at ANY u64 operand.
///
/// The witness is also UNIQUE given the operands: at each limb, exactly one `(d_limb(j),
/// borrow(j))` pair with `d_limb(j) ∈ [0, 2^16)` and `borrow(j) ∈ {0,1}` satisfies B_j. So there is
/// no prover freedom to exploit — nothing to search for.
///
/// Boundaries pin every operand limb to its PI on the first row, so the proof is about the
/// PUBLICLY CLAIMED comparison and not some other pair the prover preferred. The limb encoding is
/// injective on u64, so the 8 PIs name exactly one `(smaller, bigger)`.
///
/// F is a per-row Polynomial rather than a `BoundaryDef::Fixed` on purpose: per-row constraints
