//! # Binding-vs-identity proofs for the two-arm `ChildRef` (tests-as-spec)
//!
//! The companion to `dregg-doc/src/composition.rs` (the embed algebra) and
//! `docs/deos/DOC-CELL-COMPOSITION.md` §2.1b/§3.5. The load-bearing design move:
//! a `ChildRef` has TWO arms, and they differ on exactly one axis — whether the
//! reference is to a fixed IDENTITY or to a re-bindable NAME:
//!
//! - [`ChildRef::Cell`] — this exact cell. Stable, content-addressed; the cell's
//!   *state* evolves under the same id, and — for a recoverable identity cell —
//!   its authorized keys ROTATE in-state while the id is unchanged.
//! - [`ChildRef::Name`] — whatever a namespace currently binds this name to. A
//!   turn on the namespace REBINDS the name, and the embed FOLLOWS.
//!
//! Each property below is proven in BOTH polarities (the standing law): the thing
//! that should follow follows, AND the thing that should NOT follow does not.
//!
//! ## The identity-cell-id-stability finding (the load-bearing one)
//!
//! Property (b) — EMBED-SURVIVES-ROTATION — rests on a substrate fact established
//! by census (reported, not re-derived here): a recoverable identity cell's id is
//! `CellId = blake3_derive_key("dregg-cell-id-v1", genesis_pubkey ‖ token_id)`,
//! and BOTH `genesis_pubkey` and `token_id` are SEALED at inception
//! (`types/src/lib.rs`, `cell/src/cell.rs`). Key rotation / recovery is a
//! `SetField` on a key-COMMITMENT state slot (`CURRENT_KEYS_COMMIT_SLOT`,
//! `sdk/src/identity.rs::rotate_effects`), never the sealed pubkey — proven in
//! Lean by `Dregg2/Apps/PreRotation.lean::rotate_current_keys_irrelevant` (`rfl`:
//! the rotate verb is the SAME function of the commitment for ANY current key
//! set). VERDICT: **the id is STABLE across rotation** — so a `Cell(id)` embed of
//! an identity cell is unbroken across that cell's recovery. (If the id had been
//! current-key-bound, rotation WOULD break the embed — that would be the loud
//! finding; it is not the case.) The test below models this fact in-crate: the
//! cell's id is held FIXED while its rotating key state advances, and the embed
//! still resolves.
