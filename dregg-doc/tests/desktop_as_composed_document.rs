//! # THE DESKTOP IS A COMPOSED DOCUMENT (tests-as-spec, crate-boundary)
//!
//! The reflexive weld of `docs/deos/DOC-CELL-COMPOSITION.md §6`: "the whole
//! starbridge is kinda like a cell document." This proves it as a WIRE FACT
//! reachable from OUTSIDE the crate (through the public `dregg_doc::composition`
//! API) — the live workspace projects to a COMPOSED document (each window an
//! `Op::Embed` of its owner cell) that round-trips through the REAL
//! `content_composed` fold, where editing the projected document drives a real
//! workspace change and an out-of-cap window darkens through the membrane.
//!
//! Unlike the flat `dregg_doc::desktop` projection (surfaces = TEXT atoms), this
//! reads the desktop through the COMPOSITION algebra — a graph of cells — so the
//! desktop inherits, through the SAME fold, the per-viewer membrane (fog-of-war on
//! the desktop), the forkable layout pushout, and the cycle guard.
