//! **The live receipt-stream primitive** — a surface subscribes to the node's
//! committing receipt feed and reflects it LIVE (the "cockpit goes LIVE"
//! foundation, `docs/NEXT-WAVE.md` item D).
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! Today a surface's organs (channel / mailbox / court) are SNAPSHOTS — a
//! point-in-time read of the node. This module is the primitive that makes them
//! **live reflections of the committing node**: a [`ReceiptStream`] is a
//! subscription over the node's `GET /api/events/stream` ([`node/src/events.rs`])
//! receipt nervous system, and each committed receipt arrives as a
//! [`StreamedReceipt`] — one observed world transition (a committed turn),
//! `WorldEvent`-shaped (the crate-boundary analogue of the cockpit's
//! `WorldEvent::TurnCommitted` projection, but carrying the REAL receipt).
//!
//! It is built on the GENUINE receipt-chain shapes — it reinvents NONE of them:
//!
//!   * the wire envelope is [`dregg_query::ReceiptEventRow`] (the crate's
//!     already-canonical, transport-agnostic mirror of `events::ReceiptEvent`),
//!     extended with the full canonical [`dregg_turn::TurnReceipt`] the SSE frame's
//!     `data:` payload carries in its `receipt` field — so the stream item is the
//!     genuine committed receipt, not a parallel summary;
//!   * the cursor is the dense `chain_index` — the SAME value the node serves as
//!     the SSE `id:` / `Last-Event-ID` resume header, and the SAME monotone
//!     `since(cursor)` discipline the cockpit's `Dynamics` log already uses;
//!   * forge-detection is the REAL [`dregg_turn::TurnReceipt::receipt_hash`]
//!     (the canonical `dregg-receipt-v3` BLAKE3 digest) + the REAL
//!     [`dregg_types::merkle_root_of_receipt_hashes`] receipt-stream verifier the
//!     [`dregg_types::AttestedRoot`] binds — never a bespoke check.
//!
//! ## The three guarantees (the deliverable's named bar)
//!
//! 1. **A subscriber sees committed receipts IN ORDER.** [`ReceiptStream::ingest`]
//!    admits a receipt IFF its `chain_index` is the expected next DENSE position
//!    (the node's chain is dense + monotone). [`ReceiptStream::since`] /
//!    [`ReceiptStream::delivered`] then read the verified prefix newest-last.
//! 2. **A cursor RESUMES.** [`ReceiptStream::resume_cursor`] is the
//!    `Last-Event-ID` a reconnecting subscriber replays; a re-delivered receipt at
//!    or below the cursor is deduplicated (the node is at-least-once across
//!    reconnects), so resume is lossless and idempotent.
//! 3. **An out-of-order / FORGED item is REJECTED.** A gap or a rewind in
//!    `chain_index` is [`IngestError::OutOfOrder`]; a receipt whose body does not
//!    hash to its claimed `receipt_hash` (a tampered `receipt`, or a swapped hash)
//!    is [`IngestError::Forged`] — caught by recomputing the canonical
//!    `receipt_hash()` and comparing. A subscriber that ALSO holds the federation's
//!    [`dregg_types::AttestedRoot`] can verify the whole delivered prefix against
//!    its bound `receipt_stream_root` ([`ReceiptStream::verify_against`]).
//!
//! ## Pure core + the async edge (the executor seam, named not faked)
//!
//! The verification state machine ([`ReceiptStream::ingest`] / [`since`] /
//! [`next_ready`]) is PURE — no async, no runtime, always `cargo test`-able from a
//! fixture, exactly the discipline `dregg_query` and the cockpit's pure
//! `live_node::SseParser` keep. Behind the default `stream` feature it ALSO impls
//! [`futures_core::Stream`] over a fed queue, so the cockpit's gpui async executor
//! can `.await` a [`ReceiptStream`] (driving [`futures_core::Stream::poll_next`])
//! to advance the [`ReceiptInspector`] live — see the BUILD STATUS follow-on at the
//! foot of this file. This leaf crate carries NO HTTP / tokio dep itself (the byte
//! pull is the I/O lane's; only the parsed envelope crosses this boundary).
