//! The embedder boundary IS the cap gate.
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/EMBEDDED-WEB-SURFACE.md §2/§4.1`: libservo surfaces every
//! authority-bearing operation a `WebView` can perform as a `WebViewDelegate`
//! callback, and "a delegate is a trait that the embedder installs its own impl
//! for — so the embedding boundary IS the cap gate." This module is that, real:
//!
//! - [`WebSurfaceDelegate`] is the trait, shaped one-to-one against libservo's
//!   real `WebViewDelegate` (method names verified against `doc.servo.org` as of
//!   the doc's 2026-06-13 pin): `load_web_resource`, `allow_navigation`,
//!   `request_open_auxiliary_webview`, `request_permission`, `authenticate`.
//! - [`CapGatedDelegate`] is a real impl: each callback discharges the surface's
//!   held capability c-list, so a fetch / navigation / new-window / permission /
//!   auth the cap does not permit is refused *at the callback*, before the engine
//!   acts. The check is the GENUINE [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`]
//!   (`granted ⊆ held`) — the same gate the firmament runs for every cap.
//! - [`MockSurface`] stands in for the libservo `WebView` (**the LIBSERVO SEAM**):
//!   a real `WebView` + a `WebViewDelegate` impl that forwards to
//!   [`CapGatedDelegate`] plugs in exactly where `MockSurface` sits, without the
//!   heavy libservo + Metal/wgpu toolchain this crate deliberately does not link.
//!
//! ## The no-amplification keystone
//!
//! An iframe / script-opened window is an **attenuation of its opener — it cannot
//! amplify** (`EMBEDDED-WEB-SURFACE.md §3`). [`CapGatedDelegate::open_auxiliary`]
//! mints the child surface's authority as the parent's *plus strictly-narrowing*
//! rights, routed through the same `is_attenuation` gate; a child that asks for
//! *wider* fetch authority than its opener holds is refused for the same
//! structural reason a widening window-share is `DelegationDenied`. The web's "an
//! ad iframe inherits the page's ambient reach" footgun is closed by construction.
