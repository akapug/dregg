//! # dregg-blocklace
//!
//! # Trust Model
//!
//! This crate operates at the **CONSENSUS-TRUSTLESS** trust level.
//!
//! - **Soundness**: Finality is verified by ALL participants. Once a block reaches
//!   finality (via the constitution's supermajority rule), it cannot be reverted without
//!   violating the BFT assumption (>1/3 Byzantine). The DAG structure is self-validating:
//!   hash links make it impossible to rewrite history without detection.
//! - **Assumptions**: Honest supermajority (2f+1 of 3f+1 nodes). Network eventually
//!   delivers messages (partial synchrony). Block creators sign their blocks (Ed25519).
//!   BLAKE3 is collision-resistant (for content addressing).
//! - **Verifiable by**: Every participant independently. Any node can verify:
//!   - Block integrity (hash matches content)
//!   - Block authenticity (signature matches creator)
//!   - Causal ordering (all predecessors exist and are valid)
//!   - Finality (supermajority acknowledgment per the constitution)
//!
//! ## Trust Boundaries
//! - The blocklace does NOT verify payload semantics (that is the executor's job)
//! - The blocklace DOES guarantee total ordering and finality
//! - Dissemination is best-effort (liveness) but does not affect safety
//!
//! ## Key Invariants
//! 1. A block's ID is a deterministic function of its content (content-addressed)
//! 2. Blocks are inserted only if all predecessors are present (causal closure)
//! 3. Finalized blocks form an immutable prefix of the DAG
//! 4. The topological order is a valid linearization of the causal DAG
//!
//! Blocklace: a DAG-based data structure for Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus.
//!
//! This crate implements:
//! - Block creation and validation (content-addressed, hash-linked DAG)
//! - Cordial dissemination protocol (efficient gossip-based block propagation)
//!
//! ## Cordial Dissemination
//!
//! The key principle from the Cordial Miners paper: "send to others blocks you
//! know and think they need." Block pointers encode what each node knows,
//! enabling efficient catch-up without explicit protocol messages.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
