# emit-descriptors.sh — THE one command that regenerates every circuit descriptor
# artifact from the verified Lean emission (the SOURCE OF TRUTH) and re-pins the
# sha256 fingerprints in the Rust registry.
#
# Lean is authoritative. The `circuit/descriptors/*.json` files and the `*_FP`
# constants in `circuit/src/*.rs` are machine-generated projections of the Lean
# `EffectVmDescriptor` objects. Running this on a clean tree is a NO-OP (idempotent):
# it leaves the tree byte-identical. After moving any Lean emit, run this and commit.
#
# Usage:  scripts/emit-descriptors.sh
# Exit:   0 = installed (or no-op); 2 = an emitter failed; 3 = REGEN REFUSED —
#         a byte-CHANGING install needs DREGG_VK_REGEN_ACK (the regen re-keys the
#         federation; see docs/VK-REGEN-CONTROLS.md); other nonzero = routing gap.
