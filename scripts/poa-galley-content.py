r"""Author and assemble the Path of Angels Galley activated-content artifacts.

This script is CEREMONY TOOLING, not semantics.  It carries no reducer, no
transition, and no validity rule.  It emits candidate bytes; the authority that
accepts or refuses them is Lean:

  * `ActivatedContent.decodeManifest` (metatheory/.../ActivatedContent.lean:259)
    parses the manifest, RE-ENCODES it with `Manifest.toJson`, and demands byte
    equality (`decodeManifest_reencodes`, :262).  A manifest this script gets
    wrong is refused, not reinterpreted.
  * `GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntime.decodePolicy` (…Runtime.lean:575) does the
    same for the embedded policy component (`decodePolicy_reencodes`, :578).
  * every component `sha256` is recomputed from `bytes_utf8` by Lean
    (`Component.validB`, ActivatedContent.lean:157) and the manifest root is
    recomputed by `manifestRoot?` (:129).

So the only thing this file can do wrong is produce something that refuses.

WHAT IT WRITES (all under poa/artifacts/galley/epoch-1/)

  policy.json    the exact `PolicyWire.toJson` bytes of the authored Galley
                 policy component, NO trailing newline.
  manifest.json  the exact `Manifest.toJson` bytes of the one-component
                 activated-content manifest that embeds policy.json verbatim,
                 NO trailing newline.  This is the file the node installs.
  world.json     provenance: the content_root the curator must sign, the
                 component digest, and every preimage used below.  It is NOT
                 consumed by any program; the authoritative world identity the
                 curator signs comes from `dregg-node poa-galley-world-preview`,
                 which derives `activation_digest` through poa-curator rather
                 than reimplementing it here.

BYTE DISCIPLINE

Lean's `String.quote` (Init/Data/Repr.lean:400) escapes exactly `"` -> `\"`,
`\` -> `\\`, `\n`, `\t`, and emits `\xNN` (NOT valid JSON) for any byte <= 0x1f
or 0x7f.  Python's `json.dumps` agrees with it on `"` and `\` and on nothing
else that could appear here, so this script REFUSES any authored byte outside
printable ASCII rather than emitting something whose two encoders disagree.

USAGE
  scripts/poa-galley-content.py emit       # (re)write the three artifacts
  scripts/poa-galley-content.py check      # recompute and diff; exit 1 on drift
  scripts/poa-galley-content.py self-test  # the check can go red: a one-byte edit to each
                                           # file in a scratch copy must DRIFT, the untouched
                                           # copy must pass (the real artifacts are not touched)

`check` is a `scripts/local-gates.sh` row (`poa-galley-content`, with `-red` = self-test).
Until 2026-10-01 its only caller was `scripts/test-poa.sh` via a workflow nobody ran, and
the artifacts sat drifted (rules_digest) for eight weeks.
