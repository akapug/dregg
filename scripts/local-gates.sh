# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The bar is not "GitHub is green". It is: **these gates would succeed if run on a
# real box.** Those are different questions, and on this repo they are VERY
# different — measured 2026-07-26, of the last 60 `ci.yml` runs, 37 were CANCELLED
# and 21 failed and 0 succeeded. Not because the tree was that broken: the median
# gap between commits on `main` is 92 SECONDS and the median run needs ~87 MINUTES
# to reach a conclusion, so ~56 of every 57 pushes cancel their predecessor and
# never get measured at all. A GitHub verdict is a lottery ticket; a local run is
# an answer.
#
# Local is also, in at least two measured ways, the STRICTER test:
#   * `check-doc-refs` — macOS's case-insensitive APFS makes a doc's
#     `Circuit/Foo.lean` match the real `circuit/` dir, so ~60 dead references
#     RESOLVE on a Linux runner and die here.
#   * the `dregg-pq` fail-closed abort was CPU-count dependent: hosted runners are
#     4-vCPU (under the threshold), every dev box with 8+ cores aborted.
# So "it passed in CI" was never evidence that it passes for a person.

  # ⚑ A WIPED DEPENDENCY THAT PRESENTS AS A PROOF FAILURE (2026-08-09, twice in one
  # evening). `~/src/mathlib4` was destroyed twice; `metatheory/.lake/packages/mathlib`
  # is a SYMLINK into it, so the damage does not read as "a dependency is missing" —
  # every mathlib-importing build dies on `object file '.../Ring/Defs.olean' does not
  # exist`, which looks exactly like a broken proof. A lane spent real time believing
  # its own module was at fault. Restore is ~10 min (clone at the pinned rev + `lake
  # exe cache get`, 8105 oleans), so the cost was never the repair — it was the
  # misdiagnosis. This row is first so the answer arrives before anything else runs.
  # ⚠ NOT the tree's own scripts: `pbuild` is the only real `rsync --delete` and was
  # hardened after it ate this same path on 07-28 (`pbuild:636-648`); `reclaim-space.sh`
  # does not follow the symlink (`find` without `-L`; `rm -rf` takes the LINK). The
  # destroyer is outside this repo. This gate does not name it — it makes the damage
  # legible, which is the part that kept costing hours.
  # ⚠ AND NOT "make it read-only": lake WRITES there by design (`cache get` populates
  # it, an uncached import is built there, a rev bump adds oleans). The invariant is
  # that lake writes and nothing DELETES THROUGH the link.

  # than `lean-orphans`: that gate WAVES THROUGH an orphan if it is in lean-orphans-allow.txt
  # ("the exclusion is deliberate"); this one does NOT — a module that CLAIMS something
  # checkable and is deliberately never built is a deliberate SILENT CLAIM. Born 2026-08-01 from
  # `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaWrapFtEval0Weld`: a `#guard`-backed headline ("six gate bodies reproduce
  # the linearization constant term") with a GAMMA_CHAL `sorry` FROM ITS BIRTH COMMIT, in NO
  # lake target, so the guard NEVER RAN and the headline was never machine-checked — and the

  # acceptance list). The gate reds on any (kind, module) NOT in the baseline (the next silent

  # THE `#guard` POPULATION MAY ONLY RATCHET DOWN, per module. `check-guard-modules` above asks
  # whether a guard RUNS; this one asks whether the fact should have been a `#guard` at all.
  # ⚑ THE MEASUREMENT: `#guard e` is implemented (Lean 4.30, Lean/Elab/Tactic/Guard.lean:154-167) as
  # `unsafe evalExpr Bool` — the SAME compiled evaluator `native_decide` runs on. So a `#guard` is
  # not a cheaper check than a `native_decide` theorem; it is the same check with the NAME, the TERM
  # and the AXIOM RECORD deleted. It does not avoid trusting the compiler — it trusts the compiler
  # SILENTLY, which is why `#assert_axioms` is structurally blind to all 15,850 of them (measured
  # 2026-08-02 across 1,159 files; KimchiStepMain.lean alone holds 838). This is the sin CLAUDE.md
  # already forbids in Rust — "case-tests prove NOTHING about all inputs" — and moving the case-tests
  # into Lean did not make them verification.
  # Policy: metatheory/docs/GUARD-DISCIPLINE.md. A fact worth asserting is worth naming.
  # 15,850 cannot go to zero in one pass and a flat ban would be a gate nobody keeps green, so:
  # a PER-MODULE baseline (scripts/guard-discipline-baseline.txt) that may only SHRINK. Three reds —
  # a module ABOVE its row (the habit regrew), BELOW it (a STALE row: you converted, retire the
  # number — this is what makes the census monotone, not merely non-increasing), or carrying guards
  # with NO row (the population grew sideways). Pure text, no Lean toolchain, ~2s, git-archive HEAD
  # extract for churn-safety on a shared tree.
  # ⚠ It bounds the COUNT; it does not read what any guard CLAIMS. A module at its baseline may hold
  # its most load-bearing pin as a `#guard` forever, and a guard DELETED rather than converted moves
  # the number the same way a converted one does. Only the diff says which.
  # The `-red` row is not optional: the headline is a NEGATIVE assertion, which passes just as
  # happily on a broken reader. The synthetic-tree red-proof exercises all three arms, the control
  # (a tree at its own baseline is green), the one-way ratchet (regrowth past a RETIRED row still

  # A SCHEMA EPOCH THAT MOVED AND SAID SO NOWHERE. `docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md` is how a reader
  # reconstructs what each `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` re-genesised. On 2026-08-01 its last
  # row read "Schema epoch UNCHANGED at 20" while `persist/src/lib.rs` read 21 — `6441705e8`
  # bumped it and ran no emit — and the constant moved TWICE MORE the same day (`a62c48c7b`
  # 19 → 20 with no row at all, `6342defa2` 21 → 22).
  # ⚑ THE PLACEMENT IS THE FINDING, not the comparison. In the words of the lane that found it:
  # "an epoch is a Rust constant ANY COMMIT CAN BUMP, while ONLY the emit script appends to that
  # log — a gate that runs inside the emit path REPRODUCES THE BLIND SPOT EXACTLY." So this is
  # keyed on the CONSTANT and lives outside `emit_descriptors.py` entirely, with a second body one
  # altitude closer still (`dregg_persist::schema_epoch_log_row`, which reds for a lane that edits
  # the constant and runs `cargo test -p dregg-persist` without ever thinking about a descriptor;
  # leg 6 welds it, so deleting it reds here).
  # It also reads the SCHEMA EPOCH LEDGER against an INDEPENDENT source — `git log -p --
  # persist/src/lib.rs` — so a bump is caught by two legs that share no input, rather than by one
  # constant compared against its own definition.
  # ⚠ FAIL-CLOSED. An unparseable epoch cell, a missing column, a missing ledger, a missing
  # constant and a blind reader are each RED. A log with no `epoch:N` row is the shape this exists
  # to refuse: otherwise one malformed row silently disables the whole gate.
  # ⚠ NEVER fix a red here by widening what is compared. The constant moving IS a re-genesis;
  # the fix is an event row + a ledger row saying what re-genesised, what re-emits, and what now
  # refuses to load. ~0.4s, no cargo, no Lean, no node.
  # The `-red` row is not optional — the headline is a NEGATIVE assertion. It drives all three
  # directions on SCRATCH COPIES (bump with no row → red, add the row → green, truncate/garble/
  # delete the column → red), the ledger and monotonicity legs, a blinded reader against its own
  # floors, and — the leg that makes it a measurement rather than an injection — a RECONSTRUCTION
  # OF THE TREE AT `6441705e8`, where it must catch the bump that motivated it. A gate that cannot
  # catch its own origin story is decoration. It mutates nothing in the shared tree.

  # in `/private/tmp/.../scratchpad/` re-typed by hand each session. Two figures got quoted all day
  # that the numbers do not support, and both are the shape a hand-read table produces:
  #   * "EndoMul 32x77 exactly Mina's" — Mina's wrap-transaction has SEVENTY-NINE runs of 32 EndoMul
  #     rows, not 77, and at the time it was quoted the Lean assembly emitted ZERO. It was a fact
  #     about MINA'S blob read off one column and repeated as a conformance result about US.
  #   * "Poseidon 89/89, 100%" — quoted as COVERAGE when it was per-instance internal-row identity of
  #     the blocks we do emit. Mina's wrap has 261 permutations; coverage was 34%.
  # So the gate prints both sides of every ratio and prints those two corrections in its own output.
  # ⚑ AND IT ASSEMBLES SOMETHING NO SINGLE ARTIFACT HOLDS. `rungsUpto` is a TREE: three branches hang
  # off `w9_prev`, so `w11_bullet.json` is `prev+combine+bullet` and contains no finalize/wraphack/
  # close. Censusing one file UNDERSTATES the assembly and summing the files DOUBLE-COUNTS `w9_prev`
  # five times. The union is built by prefix-stripping, VERIFIED on the emitted bytes (typ+coeffs),
  # and a branch that is not its base plus a suffix BLOCKS rather than grading.
  # This row is the `--self-test` half: it needs NEITHER Lean NOR an emission (Mina's own gate list is
  # the honest candidate), ~2s. The full grade needs a `DREGG_WM=wrap` emission and is under --all.

  # ⚑ DECORATIVE PUBLIC INPUTS — the class found BY HAND THREE TIMES before it was a gate.
  # A `pi_binding` ties a column to a public input and to NOTHING ELSE, so a descriptor can publish
  # a bank hash, an app hash, a target root, and never name that column in a gate body or a lookup
  # tuple. `solLcVerifyDesc` did exactly that with eleven anchors; `LightClientSolanaAir` §6b said
  # in PROSE that "the identical decomposition holds for the Midnight and Tendermint descriptors"
  # and prose is not a gate. Measured 2026-08-04 over all 84 served IR-v2 descriptors: 235
  # decorative anchors in 21 of them, 63 across the five light-client VERIFY descriptors.
  # ⚑ THAT LAST NUMBER IS 62 NOW, AND SOLANA IS 10 (it went 11 → 19 → 10 in one day). The verify
  # rung absorbed `dregg-solana-stake-table-fold::v1`, so its trust anchor is the fold's eight
  # `.last` output lanes instead of nine `.first` limbs no constraint read. Read the baseline
  # header before treating either move as a regression: COLUMN COUNT IS THE WRONG DENOMINATOR.
  # The check builds the column-connectivity graph (two columns adjacent iff ONE constraint names
  # both) and reds when a PI-bound column's component is a singleton it was not baselined as.
  # ⚠ An ARITY-1 RANGE LOOKUP READS A COLUMN AND JOINS IT TO NOTHING — Mina's eighteen 29/22-bit
  # lane bounds do not make its published state hashes bound, and the gate says so.
  # Ratchet, not ban: `scripts/descriptor-anchor-inertness-baseline.txt` may only shrink, and a NEW
  # descriptor carrying decorative anchors with no row is red. Lean twin (the six light clients as
  # named theorems, each a tripwire meant to fail when a binding lands):
  # `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/LightClientAnchorConnectivity.lean`.

  # ⚑ A FULLY-IMPLEMENTED GATE THAT NOTHING RAN. `emit_descriptors.py --verify-provenance` has
  # existed for months, checks every descriptor byte against `circuit/descriptors/PROVENANCE.json`,
  # and was invoked by NO `.sh`, NO `.yml` and NO `.py` — 13 references in the tree, every one of
  # them prose. `check-descriptor-drift.sh:130` names it IN A COMMENT and invokes only
  # `--verify-by-name-routing`, whose UNSTAMPED leg reads `by_name_sha256` alone and therefore
  # cannot see the subdirectory legs at all.
  # ⚑ MEASURED at `ca0970378` by this row's own `--rev`: EIGHT of the shared table AIRs did not
  # match their stamped sha256 and TWO (`chip-v1`, `chip-state16-v1` — the Poseidon2 chip every
  # descriptor's hash sites lower into) had NO stamp row whatsoever. Ten of ten tracked artifacts
  # wrong, in HEAD, with nothing red. Repaired in the stamp by `f0a34748f`.
  # ⚑ WHY IT WENT UNRUN IS THE REAL DEFECT, and `--rev HEAD` is the fix. The gate used to grade
  # THE WORKING TREE, which in a ~10-lane shared tree means any sibling's in-flight emission reds
  # it — right now a co-tenant's uncommitted `EmitByName.lean` edit makes the working-tree form
  # report a GHOST — and `--stamp-existing`, its only repair path, REFUSES while `metatheory/` is
  # dirty, which it never is. `DREGG_VK_REGEN_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` then records `source_dirty=true`,
  # which `--strict` refuses: a stamp that looks taken and isn't. Three lanes hit that wall in one
  # day and all three correctly declined, so the artifacts stayed unstamped. A gate whose only
  # correct invocation is impossible under the conditions the repo actually operates in does not
  # get fixed; it gets routed around.
  # So this row asks the question that is ALWAYS ANSWERABLE: are the COMMITTED bytes what the
  # COMMITTED stamp pins? Detached clean worktree, HEAD-vs-HEAD, no Lean, no cargo, ~5s.
  # ⚠ `--strict` is deliberately NOT here. Its extra clause compares the stamp's tree hash against
  # `HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2`, which moves on any commit to any of 2300 Lean modules — red within
  # minutes of any stamp and permanently after, i.e. furniture. Its honest question ("are the
  # descriptors stale w.r.t. Lean?") is answered by RE-DERIVING, which is the `descriptor-drift`
  # row above. `source_dirty` was moved OUT of `--strict` into the always-checked set for the
  # mirror-image reason: it is a property of the committed stamp, always answerable, and it was
  # the one clause that would have caught the force-stamp.
  # ⚠ BUDGET IS MEASURED, NOT GUESSED, and it is generous on purpose: a TIMEOUT is not a verdict,
  # and this table has already lost a whole session's coverage to one (`gates-executed`, split
  # 2026-07-27). The cost is a 454 MB detached-worktree checkout plus the four door scans (4344
  # tracked .rs, 2300 .lean, 26 workflows). MEASURED 2026-08-02: ~18s idle, 109s while sibling
  # cargo builds saturate the disk — 15% CPU, i.e. I/O-bound, so the tail is contention, not work.

  # stamp row, a row whose artifact is gone, a `source_dirty=true` stamp) plus BOTH directions on

  # the clean control, and the VACUITY FLOOR — an empty walk must refuse, not report PASS over
  # zero artifacts. Scratch copies in a temp worktree; the shared tree is never touched.
  # MEASURED 2026-08-02: 228s under load, which TIMED OUT at 300s on its first wired run — eight
  # injected faults each re-running the four door scans over inputs the proof never mutates, i.e.
  # eight identical scans measuring nothing. The delta cases now skip those (the argument for why
  # that is sound is in `_verify_provenance_findings`, and ONE full-path run keeps it honest):
  # 95s under the same load, and 9 cases became 11.

  # ⚑ TWO OF THE TEN UNCALLED `--check` REGENERATORS, WIRED (2026-08-10). A census of the regen
  # family found ten scripts owning ~50 committed artifacts whose freshness-vs-source question is

  # `check-emitter-routing.sh`'s `regen:` class names eight of them and verifies only that the
  # script EXISTS and mentions the file — never that the file is current — so the whole family read
  # as routed while being ungraded.
  # These two are the ones that cost nothing: no Lean, no cargo, no prover, no hbox lane. MEASURED
  # on this laptop: 0.17s and 0.66s. The other eight need `lake build` + `lake env lean --run`
  # (`regen-mina-commit-stages`, `regen-wrapmain-fixtures`, `regen-cert-qp`) or a real prover run on
  # a named hbox lane (the five `regen-pasta-*`), which is a build-box row and not this table's.

  # A Lean emitter asking the poseidon2 chip for an arity the chip AIR does not admit. The
  # descriptor it produces CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED, and nothing said so: `57105f387` found the wide
  # blinded membership tooth had been asking for arity 9 SINCE THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN, and it
  # surfaced only because somebody finally tried to prove against it — which for a staged
  # descriptor may be never. There is a second mode and it is worse: at an arity outside
  # {7,11,16} the deployed witness generator puts the ARITY TAG in lane 4 and zero in 5/6, so
  # inputs the emitter handed the chip never enter the preimage. Refused is loud; discarded looks
  # like it worked.
  # ⚑ THE ADMITTED SET IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN ANYWHERE IN THE GATE, and must not be: the AIR carries
  # it as a degree-7 product over the arity column, and a constant re-typed beside its own
  # definition is decoration. The gate hands the DEPLOYED `Ir2Air::Chip` evaluator the honest chip
  # row the DEPLOYED witness generator builds, at each candidate arity, and reads the verdict; it
  # derives the per-lane pin map the same way and the lane-DROP map from a second, independent
  # source (the deployed absorb). 368 descriptors / 35 121 chip lookups across every registry,
  # `by-name/`, the Lean-emitted trees and the staged registry TSVs. Rust, not python, for exactly
  # the reason above — it must RUN the chip.
  # ⚠ NEVER fix a red here by widening the admitted set. It is the chip's S-box budget; a bad
  # arity changes in `metatheory/` and re-emits.
  # ⓘ GREEN since 2026-08-01. It landed RED on one real finding —
  # `guarded-hiding-span-m0-wide-blinded-commit-blind5-v1` asked for arity 8 and arity 14, neither
  # admitted; the SOLE emitted hidden-span descriptor, and unprovable. That is repaired: `spanIns`
  # padded 8 → 11 and `commitStage2WideIns` 14 → 16 in Lean, golden re-guarded, re-emitted (two
  # bytes: the arity tags), and the descriptor now PROVES at the deployed prover for the first time
  # (`circuit/tests/guarded_hiding_span_prove.rs`).
  # ⚠ It also landed with a defect of its OWN which meant it reported nothing in either direction:
  # all six of its tests aborted at arity 17 on `chip_absorb_all_lanes`'s `arity <= CHIP_RATE`
  # assertion, because the lane-drop sweep reused `SWEEP_CEILING = 4·CHIP_RATE`. The generator legs
  # now stop at `DROP_SWEEP_CEILING = CHIP_RATE`, which is the absorb's actual domain; the admission
  # leg still sweeps past it, since `chip_air_row_accepts` is total there.
  # ⚑ The root cause was one level up and is also closed: `chipLookupTupleN`/`ChipTableSoundN` now
  # carry `ChipArityAdmitted` as a CHECKED side condition, so an emitter at a non-admitted arity
  # FAILS TO ELABORATE instead of proving vacuously against `ins.length ≤ CHIP_RATE`.
  # The `-red` row is not optional: the headline is a NEGATIVE assertion. It drives the gate
  # against a checked-in reconstruction of the PRE-`57105f387` descriptor (extracted from that
  # commit's parent, out of the Lean emitter's own byte-pinned golden — not a fixture anybody
  # invented) and requires BOTH modes to fire; requires the same descriptor GREEN after its
  # arity-11 repair; and points the corpus walk at an empty directory so a dead reader cannot read
  # as clean. It mutates nothing in the shared tree.

  # (`extension/dregg_wasm.js` + `dregg_wasm_bg.wasm`, `--target no-modules`, loaded by the

  # build step refreshed it and no gate looked at it. It rotted for a week: `wasm/src/lib.rs`
  # exported `build_poa_signal_claim_turn`, the shipped glue had ZERO occurrences of it, and
  # `background.ts:3499` refused EVERY judged PoA Signal claim on live beta. The instrument

  # `lean-seed-freshness` now compares the pin's `DREGG_CLOSURE_HASH` — the `Dregg2.FFI`
  # boundary closure, the set the archive actually holds — against this checkout's, both from
  # `scripts/lean-seed-key.sh`. The pin's field is EMPTY right now, which means no published
  # asset is reachable by name for any checkout, so this row fails with that message.
  # OWNER: `.github/workflows/lean-seed.yml` (workflow_dispatch-only, deliberately).
  # CLEAR IT: `gh workflow run lean-seed.yml -f platforms=linux-x86_64`, then write the printed

  # this gate exists to have caught.
  # It still says nothing about what is IN the archive, and a seed can match the pin and still be missing every verified
  # decision export. Measured 2026-07-30 (issue #41): the seed installed in this checkout
  # carried 188 `Dregg2_*.o` against a 243-module boundary closure — 55 in-tree modules
  # absent, and no `Dregg2_FFI.o` — while reporting ZERO undefined initializers, because the

  # ⚑ THE THIRD QUESTION ABOUT THIS ARCHIVE, AND IT IS NOT A ROW HERE — read this before assuming
  # the two rows above cover it (2026-08-07). `lean-seed-freshness` asks whether a PUBLISHED ASSET
  # matches this checkout's closure key. `lean-seed-closure` asks whether a module has a MEMBER.
  # NEITHER asks whether a member is OLDER THAN THE `.lean` IT WAS COMPILED FROM, and that gap cost
  # a week: `dregg-lean-ffi::deployed_constraint_probe` printed `8 passed` from 07-30 to 08-06 with
  # SIX of its eight assertions false, because the archive linked on the box carried a 2026-07-25
  # `Dregg2_Exec_DeployedConstraint.o` — the pre-cutover admission-wire evaluator — that agreed
  # with the test's equally pre-cutover wire builder. Two stale things agreeing reads exactly like
  # correctness, and build.rs's PROVENANCE DOWNGRADE could not see it: that gate is whole-archive
  # and fires when the Lean build did not run. The Lean build ran. The `.c` was current. The splice
  # ran. ONE object was old.
  # For the archive a BUILD LINKED, the check is `dregg-lean-ffi/tests/linked_archive_freshness.rs`,
  # NOT a script and deliberately so: the only process that knows WHICH archive was linked is the
  # one that linked it, so build.rs hands the path over (`DREGG_LEAN_LINKED_ARCHIVE`) and the test
  # walks its `Dregg2_*.o` members against `metatheory/`. A script here would have to guess among
  # the per-OUT_DIR working copies, and `rerun-if-changed` refreshes those before a link anyway —
  # so a stale one merely resident in `target/` is not evidence of anything.
  # RUN IT WITH: `cargo nextest run -p dregg-lean-ffi --features lean-lib`.
  #
  # ⚑ AND FOR THE SEED, WHICH NO PROCESS LINKS — THIS ROW (added 2026-08-07). The paragraph above
  # is exactly why the SEED went unwatched: `libdregg_lean.a` is copied into every new `OUT_DIR`,
  # arrives by fetch/rsync/bootstrap, is inherited across checkouts, and is linked by NOTHING, so
  # the test above never has it as its subject. Measured the day this row landed: the working
  # archive was CLEAN (0 of 323) and the seed carried **56 stale members of 188** against the
  # `.lean` comparison — and **174 of 197** once the emitted `.c` is counted too, which is the
  # comparison this row makes. It is the same question, one subject wider, and it is a script
  # because the seed's path is FIXED (`dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a`), needs no cargo, and takes
  # about a second.
  # STRICTLY STRONGER, NOT WIDER: a member must be at least as new as `max(.lean, .lake/build/ir/
  # *.c)`. The `.lean` half is the Rust test's comparison unchanged; the `.c` half only ever makes
  # it fire MORE (lake regenerates a module's C when its compiled image changes for reasons its own
  # source cannot show — an import moved). ⚠ Never raise SLACK_SECS to clear a finding; a member
  # that may legitimately lag is an ALLOWLIST entry with a written reason, and there are none.

  # doctest fence is an example the compiler was told not to read, and on 2026-07-27 the
  # tree had 71 of them with ZERO reasons — structurally none COULD have one, because a
  # fence info-string rejects unknown attributes. ~38 of the 71 turned out not to be
  # structural at all: real in-scope API that had DRIFTED (a missing `use`, a renamed
  # function) and was silenced rather than repaired. So the reason goes as the first

  # structural impossibility — a dependency cycle, a deliberately broken exhibit, source
  # quoted from a non-dependency. It also catches the INERT-ATTRIBUTE shape

  # npm workspace (docs/AUDIT-IMPORTER-AND-DOCS.md §3.6, F-B10) — and what was committed
  # did not run: `tsc` failed on `src/DreggPoseidonAttestation.ts` and the PoC that was
  # reported working had run in a SCRATCH DIR at an o1js the tree did not pin. So the one
  # cryptographic result in that directory (Mina's Poseidon and dregg's agree bit-for-bit,
  # and a Kimchi circuit can verify a Merkle path into a root the Rust side produced)
  # could not go red. This row runs it from the committed TypeScript, compiled by `tsc`
  # and executed out of `dist/`: 9 gold digests + the depth-2 root + the field modulus
  # against the Rust probe's pinned table, a real Pickles compile/prove/verify of the
  # in-circuit path, two tamper rejections, and the `DreggAttestedGate` zkApp deploying on
  # a local chain and CONSUMING the proof recursively (that last one is what makes "a Mina
  # zkApp verified…" name something that ran — before this, only a bare ZkProgram had).
  # It also checks the two things the devnet deployment listed AGAINST ITSELF: the ANCHOR
  # (its comment once said "relay-authorized" over a body that checked nothing, and then a
  # lane "fixed" that with a trusted relay key — so this gate now checks the PROOF
  # OBLIGATION `setDreggRoot` carries, that the obligation REFUSES a root with no
  # BabyBear vouch in it, and the placeholder key's polarities as a PLACEHOLDER), and that
  # a WELL-FORMED proof of another statement is refused by VERIFICATION rather than by the
  # parser — with the identical proof bytes accepted on their own account update as the
  # control, which is what makes the refusal attributable.
  # ⚑ Two more legs since 2026-07-28, both MEASUREMENTS that are ratcheted at 2%: RUNG 1
  # is a Poseidon2-BabyBear MERKLE OPENING (2,677 rows/level, 58,971 for the deployed
  # depth-22 — more than one Pickles step's usable rows) and RUNG 2 is ONE FRI QUERY at
  # the deployed geometry (684,726 rows, 13-15 steps). Both are KAT'd elementwise against
  # the DEPLOYED p3 objects via the probe's `p2merkle`/`p2fold` subcommands, and Rung 2
  # needs a 16 GB node heap. That is the size of the thing the placeholder key stands in
  # for, and having it measured is why the docs can say so.
  # ⚠ It needs `node` >= 20, o1js pinned at 2.15.0, and now `cargo`, and it FAILS rather
  # than skips without any of them — like `embedded-js`. The 1.9.1 the tree used to pin is
  # not a choice: its prover bindings abort inside Poseidon absorb during `compile()` on
  # node >= 26. Cargo is required because the third leg is the DREGG SIDE:
  # `circuit-prove/sketches/mina-pasta-hash-probe` is the crate that EMITS the attested
  # root, it is its own workspace so no other row reaches it, and this gate used to be
  # Node-only — so the emitting half of the bridge ran in no gate at all. That leg runs
  # `cargo test --locked` and then the `merkle` subcommand end to end on unprecomputable
  # leaves, cross-checked elementwise against o1js. No Lean. The -red row is not optional
  # — most of these legs are NEGATIVE assertions, which pass just as happily on a broken
  # driver. It injects FIFTY-SIX faults into SCRATCH COPIES of both the TypeScript and
  # the Rust crate (never the shared tree) — and a fault that matches NOTHING is itself a
  # failure. One of them bends only the `merkle` subcommand's printed root: every
  # `cargo test` still passes and only the cross-check catches it, which is the gap the
  # third leg exists to close. Another puts back the coset-descent bug the 16-layer chain
  # leg found — right on ~half of all query indices and on 100% of the all-zero one every
  # row measurement uses, which is why no single-round check saw it.
  # ⚑ Two more legs since 2026-07-28 EVENING, and the eighth is a SOUNDNESS rung, not a
  # measurement. RUNG 6 is the DEEP QUOTIENT: every rung before it starts its fold chain
  # from a WITNESSED reduced opening, so the walk authenticates a number the prover chose
  # and says nothing about the committed trace. It is now COMPUTED from the MMCS-opened
  # rows, the absorbed claimed evaluations and the transcript's alpha, KAT'd against
  # `p2deep` (p3's own `open_input`), and the leg PROVES a witness the pre-rung-6
  # statement admits and requires the new one to REFUSE it — the gap exhibited rather than
  # asserted. RUNG 7 starts the AIR constraint evaluation at zeta (selectors, alpha-fold,
  # quotient-chunk recomposition, closing equality, all KAT'd against p3's own domain
  # algebra) and prices it as `A + N*h` with `A` and `h` MEASURED and `N` — the constraint
  # count across the root's 7 AIRs — named as uncounted rather than invented.
  # ⚑ `SELFTEST_LEGS="deep air"` scopes PASS 2 of the -red row to named legs. The
  # PRE-FLIGHT is never scoped: what you re-run is a budget question, what you notice has
  # rotted is not. A scoped run says so in its PASS line.
  # ⚑ TIERED 2026-07-30, and the cheap tier is the DEFAULT. This row was 3000s and its
  # `-red` partner was 14400s — 56% of this whole table's budget for ONE directory — and
  # in the window that grew it to nineteen legs the self-test found NOTHING. Everything
  # that arc found was found by a cheap exhaustive out-of-circuit differential: the braid
  # twin walks 11,303 segments and found four defects that "would each have compiled and
  # proved cleanly for as far as any affordable run reaches"; the uniform checker walks
  # 820 boundaries and found ALL NINETEEN block-to-block joins broken, first observable at
  # instance 46. An injection proves the gate CAN fire; it does not find defects.
  # So the row here is TIER 0: MEASURED 25s. It runs those twins, the recorded-figure
  # census, the npm coverage check, and PASS 1 of the self-test — which on the day it
  # landed found SIX unusable injections in 3.2 seconds, four pointing at nothing and two
  # matching two sites each. NOTHING IN IT COMPILES A CIRCUIT, and it says so.
  # ⚠ WHAT MOVED OUT OF THE EVERYDAY RUN: every Pickles compile/prove/verify — the zkApp
  # consumption, the tamper refusals proved by a real prover, the row ratchets, the
  # splices, the chains, the ceiling. `--tier 1` (below, under --all) proves one instance
  # per family; `--tier 2` is the old headline. docs/MINA-GATE-TIERS.md has the table and

  # no Lean build and no emitted artifact — it reads the census's own theorem statements, and a pin it
  # cannot READ is RED, never skipped, because a deleted census pin is how an instrument gets retired
  # without anyone deciding to.
  # The `-red` row is not optional: it raises every `max`/`eq` pin by one and lowers every `min` pin
  # by one and requires each to bite (19 + 2), renames a census theorem, and reshapes a statement —
  # against a CONTROL that the committed census must still pass, because a ratchet that reds on
  # everything proves nothing.

  # is not waiting for them, because a documented wound is not a detected one and a gate held back
  # until its finding is repaired is the failure mode, not the courtesy.
  # ⚑ WHY IT CATCHES WHAT THE PER-PIN GATES CANNOT. A `vk_pin` is nine `Faithful9` lanes of the
  # bound program's semantic fingerprint — `blake3::derive_key` over the canonical descriptor
  # encoding — so an AIR author reads it off a Rust tool and TYPES IT INTO LEAN. Every existing gate
  # for that is hand-written for ONE pin and carries its own target name and its own copy of
  # `key_lanes9` (six such copies in the tree). A pin added after its gate was written is ungated by
  # construction, and nothing had ever asked the question of the whole tree. This asks it with NO
  # pin-to-target map: fingerprint every served descriptor, then resolve every served pin BY SEARCH
  # through that table. There is nothing in it to keep in sync and no pin it can miss.
  # ⚠ IT SAYS "SOME descriptor", NOT "the INTENDED one" — a pin resolving to the wrong descriptor is

  # without injectivity the headline would not be the claim it reads as.
  # ⚑ AND IT CARRIES THE REFUTATION OF A FALSE COST ESTIMATE.
  # `a_trailing_newline_does_not_move_a_descriptors_fingerprint` proves over all 158 served
  # descriptors, both directions, that the fingerprint is invariant under trailing whitespace —
  # because it is taken over the PARSED descriptor and never sees file bytes. That refutes
  # `emit_descriptors.py`'s `BY_NAME_NEWLINE_TERMINATED` frozenset, whose stated reason for existing
  # is that normalising "would re-key those 5 descriptors". It cannot: normalising is a PROVENANCE
  # re-stamp, no VK rotation, no consumer re-emit. That frozenset is the only thing reconciling
  # `MinaChainEmit.lean:48` (appends "\n") with `EmitByName.lean:788` (does not) — two emitters, two

  # `vk-pin-closure` is red because a `vk_pin` is a derived value a human TYPES IN: nine `Faithful9`

  # and written into a Lean file. `Dregg2.Crypto.Blake3Compute.blake3Derive` is that hash in pure
  # Lean, so the value can be COMPUTED where it is used instead of copied to where it is needed.
  # ⚠ THE DANGER OF THAT MOVE IS THAT A WRONG `blake3Derive` FAILS SILENTLY — every pin it computes
  # would be self-consistent and wrong, which is "two agreeing transcriptions are not two witnesses;
  # they are one witness copied", generated at scale. So the differential is a STANDING gate, four
  # arms, and this row is the two that cost nothing: the two derive-key CONTEXT STRINGS read out of
  # `circuit/src/{descriptor_ir2_canonical,air_descriptor}.rs` and compared against the Lean
  # constants (derive-key folds the context into the KEY, so one character moves every fingerprint
  # and nothing else would notice), and the 35 official BLAKE3 vectors transcribed into

  # THE PICKLES HARNESSES, RUN. `cargo test --release` per crate: every accept, every tamper-reject
  # and every non-vacuity control actually proved by `proof-systems` 0.3.0 against the committed
  # Lean-emitted fixtures. It also floors the reported pass COUNT per harness, because a `cargo test`
  # that exits 0 having compiled nothing is exactly the green this whole file refuses.
  # ⚠ Each crate cold-builds kimchi + arkworks into its OWN target/ (they are separate workspaces by
  # design — they pin a proof-systems tag the breadstuffs workspace patches away). MEASURED 4m49s
  # cold for the first; warm, the whole set is minutes. The cheap coverage ratchet is in the everyday
  # table above and reds if a harness is added, deleted or loses a property; THIS row is what makes
  # the properties themselves checkable.
  "pickles-harnesses|5400|bash scripts/pickles-harnesses.sh"
  # A verification key DERIVED from Lean-emitted wrap gates, REGISTERED on an account by Mina's own
  # OCaml transaction logic (js_of_ocaml, in-process — nothing is submitted to any network). Expensive
  # because it re-derives the keys from the Lean emission every run rather than trusting a fixture:
  # `cargo run --release` on pickles-vk-derive, then o1js LocalBlockchain.
  # ⚑ ONE row, and it is the `--self-test` one on purpose: that flag runs the whole green path AND
  # then proves the gate goes RED on a bent key and on absent input. The green-only invocation is a
  # strict subset, so a second row would add budget and no coverage.
  "foreign-vk-registration|2400|bash scripts/foreign-vk-registration-gate.sh --self-test"
  # ⚑ THE REAL CONFORMANCE GRADES, and until 2026-08-03 NOTHING RAN THEM. The everyday table above
  # carries `wrapmain-conformance-red`, `stepmain-shape-diff-red` and `curve-gate-oracle-red` — the
  # `--self-test` halves — and its own comments delegate "the full gate" to
  # `scripts/pickles-synthesis-oracles.sh`. MEASURED: `grep -rn pickles-synthesis-oracles scripts/
  # .github/` returned that script and those two COMMENTS, and nothing else. The script exists, is
  # green-or-bust, runs eleven real diffs (`wrapmain-region-conformance` bare,
  # `stepmain-region-conformance --falsify --stale-self-test`, `stepmain-shape-diff` bare,
  # `curve-gate-oracle` bare, `prover-freedom-ratchet` bare, the three .ts statement oracles and the
  # cross-implementation differential) — and was reachable from no runner and no CI job. A `-red`
  # row proves an instrument CAN go red; it says nothing about the tree. This row is the other half.
  # ⚠ WHY `--all` AND NOT THE CHEAP SET, and neither reason is budget alone:
  #   * it needs o1-labs' circuit blobs, resolved from `$MINA_CIRCUIT_BLOBS_BASE_DIR`,
  #     `~/.mina/circuit-blobs` or `/usr/local/lib/mina/circuit-blobs` and otherwise FETCHED — a
  #     network dependency the everyday table does not have;
  #   * the wrap half needs a `DREGG_WM=wrap` emission at the top rung and REFUSES (exit 3) without
  #     one rather than skipping — which is exactly why it is worth running, and also why it cannot
  #     be a row people hit on every commit;
  #   * the .ts oracles need `bridge/mina-zkapp` `npm ci`, and the cross-impl differential cold-builds
  #     kimchi + arkworks unless `PICKLES_XI_RUST_VECTORS` points at pre-made vectors.
  # It is invoked WITHOUT `--no-ts`/`--no-xi` on purpose: a missing ts-node prints `RED` and exits
  # non-zero, and narrowing the invocation here would re-create the delegation this row closes.
  "pickles-synthesis-oracles|14400|bash scripts/pickles-synthesis-oracles.sh"
  # ⚑ THE WRAP CENSUS ITSELF — the ratchet, not its red-path proof (that row is in the everyday table
  # above and needs nothing). MEASURED 2026-08-04 over all fourteen rungs at the committed wrap shape:
  # 12 550 of Mina's 15 122 gates = 83.0%, with EndoMul 2528/2528, VarBaseMul 2417/2417 and
  # CompleteAdd 492/492 at parity, and PI 24 of the 24 statement words `wrap_main` actually pins.
  # RATCHET: per gate type and per `typ x length` family, |ours - mina| may SHRINK, never GROW; a new
  # divergent family reds; and a shrink that the baseline does not record reds too, which is what makes
  # the census MONOTONE rather than merely non-increasing. `--update-baseline` REFUSES on growth or on
  # a new family unless `--accept-growth` is passed, so the reflex after a red is the safe path.
  # ⚠ HERE AND NOT ABOVE for one reason: it needs a `DREGG_WM=wrap` emission of all fourteen rungs
  # (hours of Lean; `w11_bullet`'s placement alone measured 2109 s) and REFUSES — exit 3, BLOCKED —
  # without one, rather than skipping or grading a nine-rung assembly as though it were the circuit.
  # It also refuses an emission whose provenance stamp does not match the source cone as the tree
  # stands right now, so it cannot grade a file nobody emitted. ~3s when the emission is present.
  "wrapmain-shape-diff|300|node bridge/mina-zkapp/scripts/wrapmain-shape-diff.mjs"
  # THE MUTATION DIFFERENTIAL ITSELF, at its RECORDED constants — the everyday table above carries
  # only the `--self-test`, which proves the instrument can go red and says nothing about the tree.
  # This is the other half: seed 20260731, 3000 trials, floor 1.0, EXPECTED_FREE=commit_pow_witness,
  # the exact parameters the 2026-07-31 observation was taken at (agreement 100.000%, 0 forgeries,
  # 0 completeness gaps, free lanes only in `commit_pow_witness`). Changing any of them is a
  # deliberate act and the script says so in its own header.
  # ⚠ HERE AND NOT ABOVE for two reasons, and budget is the smaller one: it cargo-builds
  # `root_fri_mutation` in RELEASE when the binary is absent, and 3000 trials each run the DEPLOYED
  # `TwoAdicFriPcs::verify` over a re-decoded proof (~2 s/trial measured at 12 and 40 trials, warm).
  # It exits 3 — BLOCKED, not FAIL — when the oracle cannot be built or `.fullchain/real-root-*.json`
  # is not on the box, rather than skipping or grading a shorter run as though it were the control.
  "fri-mutation|14400|bash bridge/mina-zkapp/scripts/fri-mutation-gate.sh"
  # ⚑ DOES **HEAD** BUILD FOR SOMEBODY WHO JUST CLONED — and the instrument that answers it was, as
  # of 2026-08-06, referenced by NOTHING: not this table, not a workflow, not a doc. Its own header
  # records `main` breaking at HEAD three times in one morning with a working-tree `cargo check`
  # reporting exit 0 each time, because in a shared-tree swarm the working tree is the UNION of every
  # lane's in-flight work and is therefore systematically GREENER than HEAD.
  # ⚑ IT WENT RED THE FIRST TIME IT WAS RUN HERE, which is its red-proof and a measured one: six
  # targets across four crates, all downstream of the 2026-08-05 `dregg-verifier` carve that deleted
  # `verify_effect_vm_proof`/`replay_chain`/`ReplayVerdict` while their consumers stayed. Four were
  # landed by a sibling mid-flight; the other two (`proof_bind_seam_bites`, `wide_completeness_ledger`)
  # had not compiled in HEAD OR in any working tree and are repaired in `c3b18ac42`.
  # ⚠ AND IT NOW HAS A NON-VACUITY FLOOR. `cargo check` exits 0 printing `Finished` when everything is
  # already fresh, so an inherited `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` would have turned the whole gate into a no-op
  # that reads exactly like a pass. It refuses a run that compiled fewer units than half the workspace
  # member count — derived from `cargo metadata`, not typed in.
  # ⚠ HERE AND NOT ABOVE only for cost: a fresh `--shared` clone plus a cold whole-workspace
  # `cargo check --all-targets --keep-going` over 226 members. ~20 min measured, longer under load.
  # `HEADBUILD_KEEP_LOG=/path` preserves the full rustc output, which a red always wants.

cat <<'EOF'

NOT run here, deliberately — each is a real gate, none of them is covered by the above:
  * scripts/axiom-hygiene-guard.sh   whole Dregg2 Lean corpus. A hosted runner was KILLED at
                                     ~56 min (exit 143); it plausibly only ever failed for being
                                     on the wrong machine. Run it locally where .lake is warm.
  * scripts/bare-clone-repro-gate.sh clones + builds from scratch; minutes-to-an-hour of its own.
  * cargo test --workspace           the broadest signal there is. Run it separately, and note
                                     `--no-fail-fast` or the first failure abandons the remaining
                                     test targets and you measure less than you think.
                                     ON LINUX IT IS TWO INVOCATIONS, and the second is not
                                     optional — it is what keeps the first from costing 9 tests:
