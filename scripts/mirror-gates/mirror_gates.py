"""mirror_gates.py — the mechanical gates against the re-authored-mirror disease.

WHAT THIS IS. `docs/audit/RE-AUTHORED-MIRROR-MAP.md` swept 13 subsystems and found 21 instances of
ONE failure mode: a re-authored mirror standing in for the real thing while docs/tests claim the seam
is closed — the tests green BECAUSE they test the mirror. The map's closing line is the mandate for
this file:

    "Fixing 21 and shipping no gate returns this map to its current length within two quarters."

WHY A GATE AND NOT A RULE. The map contains its own control experiment (§3.1 mechanism 2): where the
tree FACTORED the shared thing, no drift occurred — `register_surfaces` is reused verbatim by every
surface, and exactly those 8 of 18 offering keys are the only ones in M10 not at risk. The other 10
were hand-retyped by disciplined authors and drifted. The conclusion is not rhetorical:

    SHARING PREVENTS THIS; DISCIPLINE DOES NOT.

So this is mechanism, not exhortation. Every check below is a thing a machine can decide.

THE GATES.

  A  — ARTIFACT SINGLE AUTHOR (the map's §3.2 highest-leverage move: "an artifact that is loaded at
       runtime may not also be typed by hand anywhere in the tree"; closes 7 of 21 incl. the critical
       M13). Two arms:
         A1  a hand-typed literal re-authoring an artifact that something loads   → the artifact has
             two authors, free to drift. UNLESS the same file welds literal to disk (see below).
         A2  a "golden" that IS the artifact it checks — `const GOLDEN = include_str!(P)` where
             production code also loads P. The test compares the file to itself. It proves nothing.
  D1 — RE-DECLARED-ARTIFACT LINT (map §3.3 D1). A1 is D1's first arm; D1 adds the self-confessing
       mirror doc ("Mirrors `X`" / "Kept inline" / "independent of the ... crate").
  D2 — CITATION CHECKER (map §3.3 D2; "highest truth-per-line"). Every finding in the map cites its
       own falsifier in its own prose. This makes the prose checkable.
  D3 — LIVE-PATH-VS-TESTED-PATH DIFF (map §3.3 D3; "the sharpest signal"). "The tested program is the
       one nothing outside the crate deploys; the deployed program is the one nothing tests" is a
       mechanically detectable inversion.

THE RATCHET. The 21 findings are live at HEAD and are other lanes' work, not this file's. A gate that
is red on arrival gets disabled in a week, so known findings live in `baseline.txt` keyed by a
line-number-independent identity. The gate fails on anything NOT baselined. It ALSO fails when a
baseline entry stops firing — a fixed finding must leave the baseline, so the file can only shrink.
That is the whole ratchet: new mirrors are impossible to land, old ones are impossible to forget.

FALSE POSITIVES ARE THE FAILURE MODE OF A GATE. The iterative/approximative method LEGITIMATELY
builds low-resolution parts and labels them; tripping on those would make this gate hated, and hated
gates get deleted. Two escape hatches, both of which leave a reviewable trace at the site:
  * `// mirror-gate: allow(<gate>) — <reason>` on/above the offending item — for a genuinely
    legitimate shape (a labeled off-live-path double).
  * `baseline.txt` — for a known finding awaiting its lane. Requires an M-id.
An allow with no reason text is itself a failure. Silence is never permission.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/mirror-gates/mirror_gates.py            # all gates, ratchet-enforced
    python3 scripts/mirror-gates/mirror_gates.py --gate A   # one gate
    python3 scripts/mirror-gates/mirror_gates.py --no-baseline   # every finding, incl. baselined
    python3 scripts/mirror-gates/mirror_gates.py --print-baseline  # regenerate baseline.txt body

Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = a finding not covered by the baseline, or a stale baseline entry.

    """An artifact loaded at runtime may not also be typed by hand anywhere in the tree.

    A1 — a hand-typed literal whose parsed identity IS a loaded artifact's identity. Two authors of
         one object: they are free to drift, and M13 is what that looks like (the deployed
         `predicate-arith.json` is 5 columns wide; the "golden" hand-typed beside it is 24, missing
         the entire value<->fact weld — and NOTHING compared them).

         THE ONE LEGITIMATE FORM, and the reason this is not simply "no literals": a hand-typed copy
         is fine when the same file ALSO `include_str!`s the artifact and asserts the two are equal.
         Then the literal cannot silently drift — the assert is the weld, and disk stays the single
         authority. `turn_chain_emit_gate.rs` is the map's named compliant exemplar and it has
         exactly this shape. So the rule is not "never type it" but "never type it UNWELDED".

    A2 — a golden that IS the artifact. `const GOLDEN_JSON = include_str!(P)` where production code
         also loads P means the test compares the file to itself: a tautology that survives any
         corruption of P, because both sides move together. The map names two live instances
         (`presentation_descriptor_witness.rs:179`, `blinded_membership_witness.rs:347`) and they
         are real: `descriptor_by_name.rs:200` loads the same file the "golden" loads.

    For each crate, group constructors by the type they return. A group with ≥2 members is two
    constructors of one thing — the twin-engine precondition. Then bucket each member's call sites:

        live-external : a caller in another crate, not under `#[cfg(test)]`/`tests/`  → DEPLOYED
        test          : any caller in a test scope                                    → TESTED

    Report the group where one sibling is deployed-but-untested and another is tested-but-undeployed.
    That is M01: `Roster::compile` is what `dreggnet-quest` deploys; `faction_compiled` is what the
    faction tests exercise; they are two hand-maintained constructors of one `CompiledStory` and they
    drifted. Calls propagate through in-crate non-test callers, because `Roster::compile` is deployed
    *through* `Roster::deploy` — reachability is what "deployed" means, not a direct call.

# A2 (`:480`) exempts a golden whose only reader is its own `include_str!`, on the theory that a
# single-reader const "IS the loader, not a golden". That theory holds for a PRODUCTION loader of a
# descriptors artifact. It is exactly wrong for a `*golden*` json that lives beside a test: there the
# const is the ONLY reader AND the json is the ONLY author, so the audit compares the file to itself
# and holds no matter what the file says. Measured (map §5.1 G1): the tests-local private-golden shape
# has exactly 4 instances — accumulator_nonrev, adjacency_membership, committed_threshold,
# quantified_absence — all four invisible to A2, and 1 of 4 (adjacency, 26 vs the deployed 34) had
# already drifted. G1 is the inversion A2's own docstring asks for: a `*golden*` under `tests/` must
# have an author the artifact does not have — a Lean `#guard` naming it, a second in-tree loader, or a
# weld to a tracked descriptors artifact. Absent all three, it FAILS.

# ── GATE G2 — the oracle-freshness gate ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# The map's G2 (§5.1), the sharpest new signal: a differential test may not compare against a
# gitignored/untracked artifact that no test step rebuilds. That is M30 exactly — `sdk-ts` links its
# oracle as `dregg-wasm: file:../wasm/pkg`, `wasm/pkg/.gitignore` is `*`, `git ls-files wasm/pkg` = 0,
# and (pre-fix) the `test` script built the TS but never the wasm, so "THE DRIFT KILLER" compared a
# 13-day-old binary to itself and passed while the published `@dregg/sdk@0.3.0` dropped `provenance`
# from every capability grant. The rule is decidable from the package graph alone: a `file:` oracle
# dep, used in a test, whose target dir is untracked AND is not regenerated by the `pretest`/`test`
# chain, FAILS LOUD.
