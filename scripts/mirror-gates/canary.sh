# canary.sh — PROVE THE GATES CAN BARK.
#
# The map's §3.1 mechanism (4) is "verification apparatus is exempt from the verification standard —
# nobody audits the auditor, so the auditor drifts furthest." `check-descriptor-drift.sh` states the
# self-consistency fallacy correctly in its own header AND commits it in its by-name leg (M14). A
# mirror-gate that silently stopped firing would be that exact failure at one more level, and it
# would be invisible: a gate that reports GREEN is indistinguishable from a gate that is broken.
#
# So: for every gate, reintroduce a KNOWN mirror and require the gate to go RED naming both sites;
# remove it and require GREEN. A falsifier that was never red proves nothing.
#
# The fixtures under `canary/clean/` are a miniature of the real tree — an emitted artifact, its
# production loader, the WELDED emit gate (the compliant exemplar), a LABELED off-live-path double,
# and a single-constructor program deployed by an external crate. `canary/clean/` must be GREEN: that
# half is the false-positive test, and it is the half that decides whether this gate survives contact
# with the iterative method. Each file under `canary/mirrors/` reintroduces one real finding's shape.
#
# Runs in seconds, needs no cargo, and touches nothing outside its own temp dir — safe on a shared
# tree with other lanes live.
#
#   ./scripts/mirror-gates/canary.sh          # all gates
#   ./scripts/mirror-gates/canary.sh A1 D3    # named canaries only
