# check-p3-rev.sh -- enforce that every hardcoded emberian/plonky3-recursion
# fork rev in the repo matches the single source of truth, scripts/p3-rev.env.
#
# The fork rev resolves the whole workspace's recursion crates and thus the
# compiled verifier. It is pinned in the AUTHORITATIVE workspace deps (root
# Cargo.toml [workspace.dependencies] p3-recursion/p3-circuit/...) and mirrored
# into several CI workflows (sibling-clone REV) and wasm/Cargo.toml's comment.
# All of these MUST stay in lockstep or the built verifier forks silently.
#
# Scoping: root Cargo.toml ALSO pins base upstream Plonky3/Plonky3 at a different
# 40-hex rev, so its p3-recursion rev is isolated by matching only
# `plonky3-recursion` lines (never a blind grep of the whole file). For the CI
# workflows + wasm/Cargo.toml the only 40-hex tokens present are the fork rev.
#
# NOT enforced here (reported as a WARNING, see below): the VK-hash constant
# RECURSION_P3_REV in circuit-prove/src/recursive_witness_bundle.rs. It is a
# proving-system identifier folded into the deployed recursive VK hash, so
# changing it re-keys the VK -- a VK-epoch event on a different governance track
# than a lockstep gate. This script SURFACES a drift there but does not fail on
# it, because the fix is deliberately human-gated.
