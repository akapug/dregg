# Serve the LIVE browser-native deos: deos-js cards rendered via the gpui-free web renderer
# (deos-view/src/web.rs), firing REAL cap-gated verified turns over in-tab wasm executors
# (wasm/src/bindings_card.rs — the wasm analogs of the native Applet / inspector). Two pages
# are baked + served:
#
#   /                — the GALLERY / card-picker (plain HTML, no wasm): clickable tiles, one
#                      per live card — the discoverable front door that opens each card page.
#   /counter.html    — the COUNTER card (CardWorld): a `+1` click commits a SetField +
#                      IncrementNonce turn; the bound count re-paints from the committed ledger.
#   /inspector.html  — the REFLECTIVE-INSPECTOR card (InspectorWorld): a cockpit surface, in a
#                      TAB. The inspector card's view-tree (generated from a focused cell's REAL
#                      moldable faces — RawFields + Affordances, via deos-reflect) renders to
#                      HTML: a "Cell State" section (several live Bind rows + structural rows)
#                      and an "Affordances" section. Clicking an affordance (tick/add/score)
#                      fires a real cap-gated verified turn and the bound field re-paints, with
#                      a live balance/nonce/receipt readout.
#   /tally.html      — the TALLY-BOARD card (TallyWorld): the FULL ViewNode layout vocabulary
#                      (Row + Table + a multi-affordance row). A table of named tallies, each a
#                      row with a live count and +1/−1 buttons; every click fires a real
#                      cap-gated verified turn moving that one tally, and the row re-paints.
#   /kvstore.html    — the KV-STORE SERVICE-CELL card (KvStoreWorld): a cell publishing a typed
#                      interface (put · delete · get). Clicking put/del ROUTES the call through
#                      the store's InterfaceDescriptor (the verified DFA) before it desugars to
#                      the version-bump + register SetField effects — a real cap-gated verified
#                      turn against the store cell, the monotone version advancing (a rollback is
#                      refused by the program's Monotonic constraint; get is a named OFE seam).
#   /doccollab.html  — the DOCUMENT-COLLABORATION surface (DocCollabWorld): Pijul, in a tab. A
#                      doc-cell carries a base document published to its umem-heap (the fork).
#                      Click `stitch` to diverge two authors and merge (the categorical pushout):
#                      a first-class CONFLICT surfaces (both alternatives attributed side-by-side,
#                      held off-heap). Click a resolution and the merged document publishes to the
#                      doc-cell's umem-heap as a real cap-gated verified turn — the boundary
#                      heap_root moves, a receipt is left. Conflicts-as-objects, node-less.
