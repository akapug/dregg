#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-lean-orphans.sh — no metatheory/Dregg2 module escapes CI unnoticed.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS
#   The `Dregg2` lean_lib in metatheory/lakefile.toml has NO `globs`, so `lake build`
#   compiles ONLY the modules transitively imported from metatheory/Dregg2.lean. A new
#   metatheory/Dregg2/**.lean that nothing imports builds green under `lake env lean
#   <file>`, passes its own #assert_all_clean / #assert_axioms / #guard checks — and is
#   compiled by NOTHING in the default build. Its checks never run in CI; a downstream
#   regression can silently break it and no gate goes red.
#
#   This hole RECURRED (StepBridge, AciNormal, AciComplete), caught each time only by a
#   human reviewer who then hand-registered the module. This gate makes the coverage
#   MECHANICAL: every Dregg2/**.lean must be reachable from a default lake target, or be
#   listed — with a reason — in scripts/lean-orphans-allow.txt.
#
# WHY AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A GLOB
#   Globbing the Dregg2 lib would pull the WHOLE subtree into the default build. As of
#   writing that is 136 orphan modules — many are intentional WIP (the Circuit.Emit
#   refinement rungs, FRI/STARK soundness drafts, PQ-crypto specs, game AIRs) and several
#   CARRY `sorry`. Globbing would turn the tree red and collide with the metatheory-no-sorry
#   gate. The allowlist keeps those exclusions EXPLICIT and REASONED while still failing
#   loud the instant a NEW, unlisted orphan appears.
#
# REACHABILITY (pure source-text scan; no Lean toolchain, no build — like the sibling
# independence-controls gate)
#   Seeds = the default lake targets: the `Dregg2`/`Market`/`Bfv` root modules PLUS every
#   file under the GLOBBED libs (Metatheory.+, Polis.+), since the glob builds them all.
#   Reachable = the transitive closure of `import` lines over files that exist in-tree
#   (external imports like Mathlib.* are simply not in-tree and terminate a branch).
#
# NON-VACUITY (this is a gate about COVERAGE — it must never green by scanning nothing)
#   * zero Dregg2/**.lean files found            -> FAIL (the corpus moved / scan path broke)
#   * the reachable set comes back empty          -> FAIL (Dregg2.lean unreadable / parse dead)
#   * metatheory/Dregg2.lean missing              -> FAIL (the lib root is the anchor)
#   A gate that scans an empty set is the exact disease it exists to treat.
#
# ALLOWLIST STALENESS (the list cannot outlive the exclusion it records)
#   * a listed module that IS now reachable        -> FAIL (registered but not de-listed)
#   * a listed module whose file does not exist     -> FAIL (deleted/renamed; drop the entry)
#
# USAGE

#   ORPHAN_ALLOWLIST=/path bash scripts/check-lean-orphans.sh # override the allowlist (testing)
#
# EXIT STATUS
#   0  every Dregg2/**.lean is reachable or allowlisted, list is fresh, scan is non-vacuous
#   1  an unlisted orphan, OR a stale allowlist entry, OR a vacuous scan
#   2  the scan could not run at all (missing tree / missing Dregg2.lean root)
