"""check-schema-epoch-log.py — `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` against `docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md`.

⚑ KEYED ON THE CONSTANT, NOT ON THE EMIT — and that placement IS the finding.

`docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md` is how a reader reconstructs what each schema epoch changed. On
2026-08-01 its last row said "Schema epoch UNCHANGED at 20" while `persist/src/lib.rs` read
**21**. The bump was `6441705e8`, which ran no emit. The structural defect, stated by the lane
that found it:

    An epoch is a Rust constant ANY COMMIT CAN BUMP, while ONLY the emit script appends to
    that log. A gate that runs inside the emit path REPRODUCES THE BLIND SPOT EXACTLY.

So this gate lives outside `scripts/emit_descriptors.py` entirely. It is a row of
`scripts/local-gates.sh`, and it has a second body one altitude closer to the constant —
`persist/src/tests.rs::schema_epoch_log_row`, which reds for anyone who edits the constant and
runs `cargo test -p dregg-persist` without ever thinking about a descriptor. Leg 6 below welds
that twin in place: deleting it reds this gate.

WHAT IT CHECKS (each leg is a separate finding; none of them is a threshold that can be tuned):

  L1  exactly one definition of the constant in `persist/src/lib.rs`; 0 or 2+ is a FAILURE.
  L2  every event row carries a well-formed `epoch:` cell, and the LAST `epoch:N` row equals
      the constant. This is the load-bearing comparison; the others exist so it cannot be
      quietly disabled.
  L3  the numeric epoch column never goes DOWN in file order.
  L4  the SCHEMA EPOCH LEDGER: strictly increasing, its last row equals the constant, and —
      read from an INDEPENDENT SOURCE, `git log -p -- persist/src/lib.rs` — every value the
      constant has ever held in committed history has a ledger row. A ledger value not in
      committed history is legal ONLY as the newest one and ONLY if it equals the working-tree
      constant (that is the state of a bump commit being authored right now).
  L5  FLOORS. A reader that harvests nothing must not read as clean.
  L6  the in-crate twin still exists and still names both the constant and this log.

⚠ FAIL-CLOSED IS THE POINT. A log with no parseable `epoch:N` row is a FAILURE, not a pass —
otherwise the first malformed row silently disables the gate, which is a class this repo has
~15 instances of. Same for: the log absent, the constant absent, a row with the wrong column
count, an `epoch:` cell that is neither a number nor `unchanged` nor `unknown`.

⚠ NEVER fix a red here by widening what is compared. If the constant moved, the flag day is
real: append an event row and a ledger row saying what re-genesised, per CLAUDE.md's "say what
you broke".

USAGE
  python3 scripts/check-schema-epoch-log.py                 # the gate
  python3 scripts/check-schema-epoch-log.py --self-test     # can it go red? (scratch copies only)
  python3 scripts/check-schema-epoch-log.py --log P --persist P --as-of REV   # a reconstruction

Exit 0 clean · 1 findings · 2 the gate could not run (which is also a failure).
