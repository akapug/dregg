# check-descriptor-drift.sh — THE Lean<->JSON cache-freshness GATE (CI / pre-commit).
#
# The checked-in descriptors are a CACHE of the Lean emission (Lean is the source
# of truth). This GENERATE-FRESH gate regenerates them from the verified Lean
# emission and fails if the result differs from what is checked in. This is the
# only honest Lean<->JSON guard: a `sha256(bytes) == committed-FP` rehash proves
# only that a file matches the hash committed beside it (self-consistency) — it
# CANNOT catch a committed JSON gone stale while the Lean emission moved underneath
# it. Re-deriving from Lean is the whole point; this script re-derives.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh
# Exit:   0 = no drift; nonzero = the Lean emission and the checked-in artifacts
#         disagree (run scripts/emit-descriptors.sh and commit).
