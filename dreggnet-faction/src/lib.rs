//! # `dreggnet-faction` — FACTIONS / REPUTATION as real gated cell state.
//!
//! The [`dungeon_on_dregg::dialogue`] slice proved a single NPC's DISPOSITION is real
//! committed cell state: rise-only warmth GATES friendly content ([`FieldGte`]), a
//! warmed NPC REFUSES a threat ([`FieldLte`]), a goad is a [`WriteOnce`]-permanent
//! memory that closes a topic forever. That module named the frontier precisely —
//! *"FACTION REPUTATION is the multi-cell disposition graph."* This crate builds it:
//! per-NPC disposition generalized to a **faction cell** whose owned slots are your
//! STANDING with each faction, and whose teeth are the same real
//! [`StateConstraint`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint)s the verified executor
//! re-checks on every turn.
//!
//! ## The FactionCell — standing as committed cell state (not a host tally)
//!
//! "The Feud at the Ashenmoor Gate": two rival factions hold the moor — the **Embers**
//! (a fire-cult that keeps the beacons) and the **Tide** (a drowned-coast clan). You
//! win their trust turn by turn, and the moor's content opens — or seals — on your
//! standing. Every slot is a real cell slot, every rule a real executor predicate:
//!
//! | slot              | what it remembers                    | tooth (executor-enforced [`StateConstraint`])                     |
//! |-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `rep_embers`      | your standing with the Embers        | [`Monotonic`] — rep can rise but is never un-earned                |
//! | `rep_tide`        | your standing with the Tide          | [`Monotonic`]                                                     |
//! | `embers_ceiling`  | how high the Embers will EVER trust you | drops as you pledge the Tide — the rival cap's headroom slot     |
//! | `tide_ceiling`    | how high the Tide will ever trust you | drops as you pledge the Embers                                    |
//! | `ember_quest`     | the Ember trial is unlocked          | [`WriteOnce`]; gated on [`FieldGte`]`(rep_embers, THRESHOLD)` + never-betrayed |
//! | `tide_region`     | the Tide's deeps are opened          | [`WriteOnce`]; gated on `FieldGte(rep_tide, THRESHOLD)` + never-betrayed |
//! | `embers_betrayed` | you turned on the Embers             | [`WriteOnce`]; once set, seals the Ember content forever          |
//! | `tide_betrayed`   | you turned on the Tide               | [`WriteOnce`]                                                     |
//!
//! ## The four teeth, each a real predicate, each driven NON-VACUOUSLY
//!
//! * **Reputation is [`Monotonic`] — it cannot be un-earned.** A pledge RAISES your
//!   standing (a real committed turn the Keeper's `disposition += 1` re-homes to a
//!   faction); an attempt to WRITE IT DOWN (`~ rep_embers = 0`) is a real
//!   [`WorldError::Refused`](spween_dregg::WorldError) that commits nothing — you can't
//!   fake losing (or, in a rival's telling, "forgiving") a standing you truly hold.
//! * **Content is GATED on standing.** The Ember trial unlocks only at
//!   `FieldGte(rep_embers, `[`REP_THRESHOLD`]`)` — below the threshold the SAME
//!   undertaking is refused (anti-ghost: the quest stays locked), at the threshold it
//!   commits; and the gated REGION (`ember_sanctum`) is reachable only once its unlock
//!   flag is set. You cannot enter content your standing has not earned.
//! * **A betrayal is a [`WriteOnce`]-permanent SEAL.** Turning on the Embers sets
//!   `embers_betrayed` (a `WriteOnce` the faction remembers forever) and the Ember
//!   content's gate carries `FieldEquals(embers_betrayed, 0)`: once you betray them, the
//!   trial is refused however high your standing later climbs, and the seal is
//!   UN-REOPENABLE (a recant — `~ embers_betrayed = 0` — is refused by `WriteOnce`).
//!   The exact tooth the goad uses to close the Lantern-Keeper's friendly topic.
//! * **FACTION-VS-FACTION is a real CROSS-SLOT cap.** Raising your standing with the
//!   Embers DROPS `tide_ceiling`, and the Tide pledge is gated `{ rep_tide <
//!   "$tide_ceiling" }` — the compiler's var-op-var lowering emits a real
//!   [`FieldLteOther`] cross-slot tooth (`new[rep_tide] <= new[tide_ceiling]`). So the
//!   two factions are RIVALS on the verified executor: pledge the Embers deep enough and
//!   the Tide will no longer have you — over-raising the Tide while the Embers are high
//!   is a real `Refused`, not a host courtesy.
//!
//! ## Honest scope + edge
//!
//! * Standing is committed cell state and every gate is executor-refereed: you cannot
//!   fake being trusted, and content gated on standing is a kernel predicate a stranger
//!   re-checks — not app bookkeeping (the LARP the rebuild kills). Each tooth is driven
//!   both ways (refused, then admitted, one committed turn the only difference) in
//!   [`mod tests`].
//! * This is ONE faction cell — one serial writer under one owner key (the same
//!   single-cell envelope [`dungeon_on_dregg::dialogue`] names). Rep persisted on the
//!   player's CHARACTER cell alongside echoes/boon (the progression sheet), faction-WAR
//!   world events (a beacon-seeded moor whose control shifts), and faction quests
//!   COMPOSING with `dreggnet-quest` are named seams over this real core, not gaps in it.
//! * The rival cap rides a HEADROOM slot (`tide_ceiling`) the pledge decrements: a
//!   direct atom cannot subtract one slot from another, so the "sum-capped allegiance"
//!   is carried as a maintained ceiling. The cross-slot `FieldLteOther` that reads it is
//!   the real tooth; a native cross-slot SUM bound is the noted sharpening.
