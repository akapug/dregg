//! # `ugc-dregg` — a UGC registry + a NO-CHEAT verifiable leaderboard
//!
//! The platform flywheel. Authors **publish** universes; players **submit**
//! completions; the leaderboard accepts a completion ONLY if its recorded receipt
//! chain **verifies** — a stranger re-executes the same identically-seeded universe
//! with the submitted moves and it reaches the **WIN state**, and the chain links.
//! Leaderboards are therefore trustable **by construction**, not by honor.
//!
//! ## The two verbs
//!
//! * **PUBLISH** ([`Universe::authored`] / [`Universe::from_procgen`] →
//!   [`Registry::publish`]) — a universe is a *compiled spween world* (or a
//!   *committed procgen seed*, from which the same world regenerates byte-for-byte) +
//!   a name + an author. The registry is keyed by the **universe commitment**
//!   ([`UniverseId`]) — content-addressed, so the same universe has the same id.
//! * **SUBMIT** ([`Completion`] → [`Registry::submit`]) — a player submits a recorded
//!   [`Playthrough`](spween_dregg::Playthrough) (the ordered moves + their receipt
//!   chain) + a claimed turns-to-win. The board **verifies** it and only then
//!   accepts + ranks.
//!
//! ## The no-cheat tooth (why the board cannot be gamed)
//!
//! [`verify_completion`] is the whole guarantee, and it is spween-dregg's audited
//! re-verifier used verbatim:
//!
//! 1. **Re-execute.** Deploy a FRESH, identically-seeded world from the universe's
//!    scene and re-drive it through the submitted moves
//!    ([`verify`](spween_dregg::verify) = chain-linkage + `verify_by_replay`). A
//!    forged / edited / spliced move is **refused by the real executor on replay**,
//!    or diverges from the reproduced committed state. Either way it FAILS.
//! 2. **Require the WIN.** The replay must reach the universe's declared win state
//!    (the scene ENDED, plus any declared win-vars, e.g. `gold == 500`). An
//!    incomplete playthrough that never reaches the win is REJECTED.
//! 3. **Bind the result.** The claimed turns-to-win must equal the verified move
//!    count. A tampered result is REJECTED.
//!
//! Only a completion that passes all three is accepted and ranked (by turns). Anyone
//! can re-run [`verify_completion`] — or [`Registry::reverify_entry`] — against a
//! universe they reconstruct independently, and get the same verdict.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! Verification is **O(N) replay** — a re-verifier re-executes every move. The
//! succinct light client (verify a win in time sub-linear in the playthrough) is a
//! separate, Lane-D-blocked workstream and is NOT claimed here. What also remains:
//! **author identity / signatures** (a universe carries an author *name*, not yet a
//! verified signing key), **persistence** (the [`Registry`] is in-memory), and
//! **anti-sybil** (nothing rate-limits or stakes a submission). The no-cheat property
//! — *a ranked completion provably reaches the win* — holds regardless of those.
