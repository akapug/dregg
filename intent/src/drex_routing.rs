//! # `drex_routing` — the ring-of-locks, wired END-TO-END (the routing capstone)
//!
//! `docs/deos/DREX-ROUTING.md` names the whole cross-chain trade lifecycle — lock → mirror →
//! DrEX-clear → clearing proof → escrow-release — and grades the individual pieces BUILT, but the
//! table's last rows call the *wiring* of them into one runnable flow UNBUILT ("Vault ↔ DrEX
//! wiring", `§4(e)`). The pieces each run in isolation:
//!
//!   * the LOCK→MIRROR mint (`dregg_bridge::solana_mirror::MirrorState`, `live_supply ≤
//!     currently_locked`),
//!   * the REAL ring matcher + VERIFIED conserving settlement (`crate::solver` +
//!     `crate::verified_settle`, each leg folded through the proved per-asset kernel
//!     `recKExecAsset`),
//!   * the proof-gated timeout/refund ESCROW on the vault (`chain/contracts/DreggVault.sol`,
//!     `escrowRelease` gated on `settlement.isProvenRoot(clearingRoot)`).
//!
//! What was missing was the GLUE: nothing carried a *real cleared ring* into the exact objects the
//! vault releases against. `DreggVaultEscrow.t.sol` releases against a HAND-PICKED
//! `CLEARING_ROOT = 0xC1EA5` and a fabricated fill proof — disconnected from any clearing the solver
//! actually found.
//!
//! This module is that glue. It runs the flow for real —
//!
//! ```text

//!            │                                        │  (a native dregg AssetId per party)

//!                                        CLEARING ROOT (over the settled post-ledger)
//!                                        + per-leg ESCROW-RELEASE instruction
//!                                          {escrow_id, depositor, recipient, amount}
//! ```
//!
//! — and emits a [`RoutingFixture`]: the clearing root plus one release instruction per ring leg,
//! keyed exactly as `DreggVault.escrowRelease` decodes them (`escrowId, token, amount, recipient,
//! clearingRoot`). `chain/test/DrexRoutingE2E.t.sol` consumes that fixture and drives the on-chain
//! escrow: lock (`escrowDeposit`) → clearing proof lands (`settlement.setProven(clearingRoot)`) →
//! `escrowRelease` pays the ring-matched recipient. So the SAME clearing root the real DrEX ring
//! produced is the one the vault releases against.
//!
//! ## Honest scope (the residuals, labeled — NOT hidden)
//!
//! * The clearing root here is a deterministic digest over the VERIFIED post-ledger. In production
//!   it is the rung-8 settled state root the `DreggSettlement` contract proves; turning a cleared
//!   fill into a fresh Groth16 settlement proof (proof-gen) is the NAMED residual `DREX-ROUTING.md
//!   §4(e)` (blocked on fixture-geometry). The escrow's proof VERIFICATION is therefore mocked in
//!   the Foundry e2e (a `MockSP1Verifier` / `MockSettlement`) exactly as the design says proof-gen
//!   is unbuilt — the DATA flow is real, the proof carrier is the labeled placeholder.
//! * One vault instance in the e2e stands in for the per-chain vaults; each escrow is one party's
//!   lock. FULL cross-vault atomic release across a permanently-unavailable chain is the `§4(a)`
//!   RESEARCH rung — untouched here.
//! * The mirror is a trusted-oracle mirror (`solana_mirror.rs` trust model); the trustless
//!   consensus-verified lock is `solana_trustless.rs`, a separate lane.
