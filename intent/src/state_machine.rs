//! Canonical intent lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! Intent lifecycle in dregg flows through five states:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Pending ──submit──▶ Matched ──seal──▶ Sealed ──fulfill──▶ Fulfilled ──settle──▶ Settled
//!      │                  │                  │                    │
//!      │                  │                  │                    │
//!      └── Expired (timeout / GC, any state before Settled) ──────┘
//! ```
//!
//! ## Per SLOT-CAVEATS-DESIGN.md §`AllowedTransitions`
//!
//! When the intent pool migrates to a cell-program pattern (per
//! `STORAGE-AS-CELL-PROGRAMS.md`), the intent cell's `status` slot will
//! carry an `AllowedTransitions { allowed: Vec<(old_val, new_val)>,
//! slot_index }` caveat enforcing exactly the transitions enumerated by
//! [`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`] below. No application code will need to
//! re-check transitions — the executor's slot-caveat layer does so.
//!
//! This module ships the *schema* now (the const transition table and
//! the [`IntentLifecycleState`] enum). The cell-program migration is a
//! separate lane.
//!
//! ## Why an enum and not a string
//!
//! Slot values are 32-byte field elements. We encode each state as a
//! distinguishable `[u8; 32]` via [`IntentLifecycleState::as_slot_value`].
//! The encoding is stable (it's the BLAKE3-derive of the variant name
//! under a fixed domain) so receipts and slot caveats reference the
//! same bytes across runs.
