//! Ring-settlement differential: PIN the Rust intent-crate ring settlement against the
//! VERIFIED executor's per-asset conservation + atomicity decision.
//!
//! # Why this test exists (the coherence move)
//!
//! The running matcher (`solver.rs` / `trustless.rs`) settles ring trades with its OWN Rust
//! accounting: `RingSolver::validate_ring` builds the `Vec<Settlement>` legs from a cycle, and
//! `check_settlement_conservation` (exposed here as `trustless::ring_conservation_decision`)
//! decides accept/reject by the closed-accounting shape (no phantom value / per-asset balance /
//! cycle closure). That settlement path had ZERO references to the verified executor
//! (`grep dregg_lean_ffi intent/src` = 0) — value moved off the verified path.
//!
//! The verified executor's settlement semantics are now MODELLED + PROVED in Lean
//! (`metatheory/Dregg2/Intent/Ring.lean`): a ring's legs are folded through the verified
//! per-asset kernel `recKExecAsset` (the SAME gate the mandates route through), with two
//! keystones —
//!
//!   * `settleRing_conserves` — a fully-settled ring conserves value PER ASSET (Σ legs = 0);
//!   * `settleRing_atomic` — any leg that cannot commit aborts the WHOLE ring (all-or-nothing).
//!
//! This differential PINS that the Rust ring-settlement decision AGREES with that verified
//! semantics over a ring corpus: the [`verified_executor_reference`] below is a faithful
//! reimplementation of the Lean `settleRing` fold (the EXACT `recKExecAsset` gate + per-asset
//! ledger the Lean keystones are proved over — mirrored the same way
//! `dregg-lean-ffi/src/full_turn_differential.rs` mirrors `execFullTurn`). For each ring we
//! assert: the Rust intent path accepts the ring IFF the verified executor settles it fully and
//! conserves every asset. A drift between the two is caught here.
//!
//! NEXT STEP (named-open, not done here): route the LIVE settlement
//! (`TrustlessIntentEngine::finalize` → `lowering::lower` → `SealedTurn`) through the verified
//! executor FFI (`dregg_lean_ffi::shadow_exec_full_forest_auth` via `dregg-turn`'s `lean-shadow`
//! feature) instead of executing the `SealedTurn` on the legacy Rust path. That is a full
//! turn-execution refactor gated on the FFI feature; this differential pins the SEMANTICS agree
//! first (the "differential first" discipline, like the captp/mandate differentials).
