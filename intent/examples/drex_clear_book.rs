//! # DrEX (Dragon's EXchange) — the clear-book demo: run it, it drives the REAL matcher + executor
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p dregg-intent --example drex_clear_book
//! ```
//!
//! A runnable Dragon's EXchange, end-to-end, from its **proved rungs** — the same way
//! `dregg-interchain-gov/examples/cross_chain_vote.rs` runs governance from proved verifiers.
//! Orders come in; the order book is **aggregated** (rung-2); the **real ring matcher**
//! (`intent/src/solver.rs` — Johnson's elementary circuits + Shapley–Scarf top-trading-cycles)
//! finds the multilateral clearing that no bilateral market can; the clearing is **settled through
//! the verified executor** (`intent/src/verified_settle.rs` — the ring folded, leg by leg, through
//! the Lean FFI `@[export] dregg_record_kernel_step` over the PROVED `Exec.recKExec` kernel); the
//! cleared allocations conserve per asset and respect every declared limit. Then a bad settlement
//! (an over-debit) is **refused by the verified kernel**, atomically.
//!
//! ## What ties to what (the realization of the proved rungs)
//!
//! - **rung-1 (fair clearing)** — `metatheory/Market/Clearing.lean`: `ringBook` (a genuinely
//!   3-multilateral book, `ringBook_bilateral_stuck` + `ring_pairs_refused` + `ringClearing`),
//!   `clearing_conserves_per_asset`. THIS DEMO's ring is the solver-shaped realization: a 3-cycle
//!   of three distinct assets that is bilaterally stuck and clears only as a ring.
//! - **rung-1 fairness** — `metatheory/Market/Fairness.lean`: `clearing_respects_limits` (every
//!   participant receives ≥ its declared `want_min` and sends ≤ its offer) and `overdebit_refused`
//!   (`¬ CycleValid underfundCycle`). The demo checks the SAME two properties on the cleared batch.
//! - **rung-2 (order-book aggregation)** — `metatheory/Market/Aggregation.lean`: `AggregationSound`
//!   (`aggregate` is a permutation of the submissions — no drop / no insert — sorted by declared
//!   price-time priority; `faithful_preserves_count`). The demo aggregates and asserts faithfulness.
//! - **the ledger realization** — the matcher's clearing IS lowered to a `dregg_turn::Turn` and
//!   folded through the verified per-asset kernel (`settleRing_conserves` / `settleRing_atomic`,
//!   `metatheory/Dregg2/Intent/Ring.lean`), so "an intent cleared" literally MEANS "a verified,
//!   conserving executor turn executed".
//!
//! ## Honest scope — DrEX over the CLEAR book
//!
//! This is **DrEX clear-book: the proved matching engine, running** over PUBLIC orders.
//!   * REAL: the matcher (`solver.rs`), the lowering (`lowering.rs`), and the verified settlement
//!     (`verified_settle.rs`) folded through the Lean per-asset kernel gate.
//!   * FIXTURE/SIMPLIFIED (said so, inline, when it prints): the orders here are a hand-built book;
//!     the solver models compatibility off single-asset per-leg equality (the Lean rung-1 book is
//!     richer — bundles + exact predicates); the verified-executor gate runs the IN-PROCESS proved
//!     transition here (an FFI-free target registers no gate) — on a native node with the
//!     `dregg-exec-lean` gate installed, each leg is ADDITIONALLY cross-checked against the real
//!     `dregg_record_kernel_step` export and any drift fails closed.
//!   * NEXT RUNGS (a separate track, not in this demo): rung-3 = ring-over-shielded-notes (private
//!     matching); rung-5 = uniform prices + partial fills (lifting the discrete substrate).
