//! The **card-in-the-tab** drive loop — the wasm analog of the native
//! [`deos_js::applet::Applet::fire`].
//!
//! A deos-js card renders renderer-independently: the SAME `ViewNode` tree paints to
//! gpui pixels natively (`deos-view`'s `render`) AND to browser HTML (`deos-view`'s
//! `web` renderer). The web renderer carries each `button`'s `{turn, arg}` affordance
//! into the DOM (`data-turn`/`data-arg`) and dispatches a `deos-affordance` CustomEvent
//! on click — but the LIVE turn was the named seam: a browser click had no cap-gated
//! verified executor to fire into.
//!
//! This module CLOSES that seam **in the tab**. `mozjs` (the native `deos-js` engine)
//! can't link on wasm32, so we don't carry `Applet` here — but its `fire` loop is
//! tiny and rests entirely on the embedded `DreggEngine` (via [`crate::runtime`]),
//! which IS in the wasm graph. So we re-express the SAME loop with the SAME effects:
//!
//! `Applet::fire("inc", 1)` natively builds an action of `Effect::SetField { slot,
//! count+arg }` + `Effect::IncrementNonce`, runs it through the embedded verified
//! executor, and re-reads the bound slot. [`CardWorld::fire`] here does precisely
//! that — a REAL signed turn through the canonical [`crate::runtime::DreggRuntime`]
//! executor (the same `execute_turn_for_agent` every other wasm turn rides), leaving
//! a real receipt. The browser's `deos-affordance` listener calls [`CardWorld::fire`]
//! and re-paints the `data-slot` bind from the returned value — the SolidJS-shaped
//! signal re-render, but every "+1" is now a cap-gated verified turn, not a console
//! log.
//!
//! The `u64`↔felt packing mirrors `deos_js::applet::{pack_u64, unpack_u64}`
//! (little-endian into the first 8 bytes of the 32-byte field element), so the value
//! a card binds in the tab is byte-identical to the value the native applet binds.

//
// `CardWorld`/`TallyWorld` move a cell's slots through bare `SetField` turns — a counter, not
// a vote. `PollWorld` is the REAL `collective-choice` engine's shape as an in-tab world: a
// quorum-gated, one-vote-per-ballot, monotone-tally vote where each `cast` is a genuine
// cap-gated verified turn (a ballot's `WriteOnce(VOTE)` write + a poll cell's `Monotonic`
// tally bump), the decision-turn is gated by the polis `AffineLe` quorum, and the tally is
// light-client-recomputable from the append-only cast log.
//
// ── WHY A TRIMMED (BUT REAL) SHAPE, NOT THE `collective-choice` CRATE ────────────────────
// The `collective-choice` crate CANNOT be a wasm32 dependency: its `CollectiveChoice` engine
// is built on `dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor`, and `dregg-app-framework` depends on
// `axum` + `tokio` (features = ["full"]) + `reqwest` + `tower-http` — none of which compile
// to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (server I/O, native sockets). This is the SAME wall the wasm
// Cargo.toml already names for `starbridge-kvstore`/`-subscription`/`-governed-namespace`.
//
// So — exactly as `KvStoreWorld` re-materialises the kvstore program VALUE over the wasm
// `DreggRuntime` executor rather than depending on the axum-bound crate — `PollWorld`
// re-expresses `collective-choice`'s four proven mechanisms over the SAME wasm-compatible
// `TurnExecutor`, keeping every tooth REAL (the identical `StateConstraint` turn shapes the
// executor re-enforces on the verified commit path, mirroring `CollectiveChoice::poll_program`
// + `starbridge_privacy_voting`'s ballot `WriteOnce(VOTE)`):
//   (i)   one-vote-per-ballot : each voter's ballot cell carries `WriteOnce(VOTE)` — a second
//                               vote that CHANGES the ballot's choice is an EXECUTOR REFUSAL
