//! **The document-collaboration surface, in the tab** — the Pijul/conflicts-as-objects
//! flow (fork → diverge → stitch → a first-class conflict → resolve → publish), node-less,
//! over an in-tab verified executor.
//!
//! This is the wasm realization of the native desktop doc-collab flow (`deos-js`'s
//! `program_doc`, riding `dregg-doc`): a document is a **graph of alive/dead content atoms**
//! ([`dregg_doc::DocGraph`]); an edit is a **patch**; concurrent edits reconcile by **merge**,
//! the categorical **pushout** ([`dregg_doc::merge`]); and a **conflict** — two live,
//! mutually-unordered alternatives — is a *first-class STATE* the document carries
//! ([`dregg_doc::ConflictRegion`]), each alternative attributed to who wrote it, resolved by a
//! later patch ([`dregg_doc::resolutions_for`]), never a merge failure.
//!
//! `mozjs`/gpui can't link on wasm32 so we don't carry the native `program_doc`/cockpit here —
//! but the patch theory IS dependency-free and the umem-heap ride is pure `dregg-cell` (both in
//! the wasm graph), so [`DocCollabWorld`] re-expresses the SAME flow over its own in-tab cell:
//!
//! 1. **fork** — a doc-cell (agent 0) carries a base document, published to its umem-heap;
//! 2. **diverge** — two authors (alice, bob) branch off the shared tail and each append a line;
//! 3. **stitch** — `merge` the two branches = the pushout; a first-class [`ConflictRegion`]
//!    surfaces (the antichain), **held off-heap** — the committed umem boundary still equals the
//!    base; the conflict is rendered as a `ViewNode` ConflictView (alternatives side-by-side,
//!    attributed) via [`Self::view_tree_json`] / [`Self::view_html`];
//! 4. **resolve** — a one-click [`dregg_doc::ResolutionChoice`] (keep-one / order-both) collapses
//!    the conflict; the merged document is **published to the doc-cell's umem-heap as a real
//!    verified turn** ([`Self::publish`]): the resolved graph is projected into the cell's
//!    heap and the boundary `heap_root` resealed (the umem boundary — there is NO kernel
//!    heap-write effect, so this is the same off-executor reseal the native `DocHeapCell` ride
//!    uses, `turn/src/journal.rs` "awaiting the live heap-writing effect"), THEN a real cap-gated
//!    verified `SetField + IncrementNonce` turn over the in-tab executor binds the new boundary
//!    root as the receipted publish (the turn's recorded post-state commitment includes the
//!    freshly-resealed `heap_root`, limb 28).
//!
//! No kernel effect is added — the one extra fact (the boundary moved) rides the SAME
//! `SetField`/`IncrementNonce` the kernel already enforces, plus the off-executor umem reseal the
//! substrate already commits. The anti-forge tooth survives onto the real root: forging an
//! alternative's author or dropping an alternative changes `substrate_commit`, so a light client
//! cannot be shown a conflict that hides or forges an alternative
//! (`dregg-doc/src/substrate.rs`).
