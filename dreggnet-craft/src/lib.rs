//! # `dreggnet-craft` — a provably-fair FORGE: the economy's first real SINK.
//!
//! CRAFTING (GAME-INFRA-ROADMAP progression #2). Every other economy motion so far
//! is a FAUCET — loot drops, echoes, quest rewards MINT assets into circulation. A
//! forge is the inverse and the thing an economy actually needs: it **CONSUMES** N
//! owned material assets (the inputs) and produces ONE new output asset. The inputs
//! are genuinely destroyed on-chain — the first real **sink**, the tooth that keeps
//! the supply from only ever growing.
//!
//! ## The forge, end to end
//!
//! 1. **The fair outcome.** A craft's quality is one indexed draw of a VERIFIED
//!    procgen stream ([`procgen_dregg::verified_stream`]) seeded by a committed
//!    **craft seed** ([`derive_craft_seed`]) — a domain-separated hash of a committed
//!    beacon value, the recipe id, and the (sorted) input [`AssetId`]s. The quality is
//!    the draw's distribution ([`quality_of_roll`]): a [`CraftQuality::Legendary`] is
//!    the ~3% tail — a *provable* flex. Because the seed is committed and the draw is a
//!    pure verified function of it, anyone re-derives the identical outcome (the
//!    fairness anchor is procgen's), so a legendary craft cannot be fabricated.
//! 2. **The inputs are SPENT.** Before minting anything the forge checks every input
//!    is a real asset the crafter owns and that is still *live* (not already spent /
//!    consumed). It then **destroys each input on-chain** through the asset layer's own
//!    spend tooth ([`dreggnet_asset::AssetWorld::attempt_respend`] on the live tail: a
//!    genuine committed owner-signed spend, after which the asset layer's own
//!    [`dreggnet_asset::AssetWorld::verify_provenance`] reports the note *gone*). The
//!    materials are consumed — there is no dupe-then-craft, because a spent note cannot
//!    be spent again.
//! 3. **The output binds its provenance.** A verified craft MINTS a
//!    [`dreggnet_asset`] note owned by the crafter under a **mint seed = the craft's
//!    content commitment** ([`craft_commitment`], binding the recipe id, the input
//!    [`AssetId`]s, the fair roll, and the quality). The output's content address
//!    ([`AssetId`]) therefore itself encodes "forged from THESE inputs, THAT recipe, a
//!    1% roll" — the flex is baked into the item's identity, not a side note.
//!
//! ## A forged craft mints NOTHING
//!
//! [`CraftForge::craft`] gates the whole motion on [`reverify_craft`] + the input
//! liveness check. A fabricated outcome — a craft claiming a legendary the seed never
//! produced (a rewritten roll/quality) — fails [`reverify_craft`] and **no input is
//! spent and no asset is minted**. A craft claiming inputs the crafter does not own, or
//! inputs already consumed, is **Refused** with no mint. So a crafted item cannot be
//! conjured; its inputs must be *really destroyed* and its outcome must be the *fair
//! draw*.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! REAL here: the input-consuming sink (materials provably destroyed on-chain, not
//! merely bookkept), the committed-seed fair quality draw, the recipe/inputs/roll-bound
//! output identity, and the forged-craft refusal — all DRIVEN in [`mod tests`] against
//! the real [`dreggnet_asset`] executor-refereed asset layer. NAMED, not built:
//! **recipe trees** (a recipe here is an id + a minimum input count, not a typed
//! material graph), **catalysts** (an input that shifts the odds), **weighted quality
//! tiers** (the flat `d100` bands here become a [`procgen_dregg`] E2
//! `DrawStream::weighted` CDF over a committed weight table), and **commissioned
//! crafts** (a craft paid for through the `escrow-market` swap). This module is the
//! sink primitive those surfaces deepen.
