//! **The craft forge** — the material / craft / provenance surface over a real
//! [`dreggnet_asset::AssetWorld`], crafting against a committed [`RecipeBook`]. A material
//! is a real owned asset carrying a typed [`MaterialKind`] (faucet-minted, or SOURCED from a
//! verified [`dungeon_on_dregg::loot`] drop); a craft re-verifies the fair draw against the
//! catalog's committed weights, checks the typed inputs, DESTROYS them on-chain (the sink),
//! and — on a minting outcome — mints a real output whose id binds the recipe + inputs +
//! band + quality + the concrete [`CraftedArtifact`]. A forged craft, an unknown recipe, or
//! a wrong-input craft is refused before any spend or mint.
