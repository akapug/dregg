//! The CALM coordination classifier — the query planner of
//! .docs-history-noclaude/EPISTEMIC-DATALOG.md, graded from day one.
//!
//! CALM (Hellerstein/Ameloot): a distributed computation is coordination-free
//! iff it is expressible in monotone Datalog. The proved instance on dregg's
//! side is `DreggCalculus.modality_price_monotone` ("grow-only ⇒
//! coordination-free"); this module is the per-query application of that
//! grading to the Q1 surface:
//!
//! - The EDB is append-only and height-stamped (monotone by construction).
//! - Positive atoms, joins, and filters are MONOTONE operators: once an
//!   answer row appears it never retracts as more receipts arrive. Such a
//!   query is answerable from ANY node's partial view and is cacheable —
//!   coordination-free.
//! - A NEGATED atom is one non-monotone operator on this surface:
//!   "not revoked(Cap, _)" can flip an answer row from present to absent
//!   when a later receipt arrives. Its answer is correct only relative to a
//!   FINALIZED prefix — "this answer is only as fresh as height H" — the
//!   canonical case being negation-over-revocation.
//! - AGGREGATION (`count`/`sum`/`min`/`max`, the Q3 layer) is the other:
//!   the aggregate VALUE moves as receipts arrive (a count grows, a min
//!   falls), so a `(group, value)` row retracts when a later receipt revises
//!   it. Aggregation is therefore finalized-dependent too — the aggregate is
//!   exact only over the certified, finalized prefix.
//!
//! (A `group_by` with NO aggregates is a plain DISTINCT projection of a
//! monotone query — it stays monotone; only the aggregate fold is
//! non-monotone.) Negation and aggregation exhaust the non-monotone surface:
//! there is no recursion.
