//! The receipt row `dregg-query` consumes — a JSON-friendly mirror of what
//! the node serves, plus the offline form tests construct directly.
//!
//! ## Where each field comes from on the live node
//!
//! - `GET /api/receipts` (node/src/api.rs `ReceiptInfo`): `chain_index`,
//!   `receipt_hash`, `agent`, timestamps — but NO per-effect detail and no
//!   height.
//! - `GET /api/events` (node/src/events.rs `ReceiptEvent`): adds `height`
//!   and `kinds: Vec<String>` (effect-KIND summaries from the commit record)
//!   plus the full canonical `dregg_turn::TurnReceipt` — whose
//!   `derivation_records` carry capability grants and whose `emitted_events`
//!   carry app-level events, but transfer endpoints/amounts are only inside
//!   `effects_hash` (not disclosed per-effect).
//!
//! So TODAY the node can populate `chain_index`/`receipt_hash`/`agent`/
//! `height` and grant-shaped effects; `transfer`/`balance` rows need the
//! enrichment spec'd in [`crate::client`] (the `effects` array below IS that
//! wire shape). Offline mode constructs `ReceiptRecord`s directly.
