//! [`Watcher`] — detect inbound `$DREGG` payments to a user's deposit address.
//!
//! # RESTART SEMANTICS (`docs/reference/RESTART-SEMANTICS.md`)
//!
//! **The production credit path holds NO in-RAM cursor.** [`SignatureWatcher`] is the
//! selected real watcher and it is *process-stateless*: it re-observes the recent
//! transfer history on every poll and mints one [`PaymentRef`] per **transaction
//! signature**, a property of the CHAIN rather than of this process. Deduplication is
//! entirely the durable [`CreditLedger`](crate::ledger::CreditLedger)'s job, which is
//! answer **2 (REBUILD)** in its strongest form — the durable source needs no new store,
//! because the already-durable `pay_processed` table *is* the cursor.
//!
//! This is deliberate, and it is the repair of a real wound: the balance-total key
//! `sol:{addr}:{slot}:{amount}` bound the RPC's **current** slot, which advances every
//! ~400ms, so the key was fresh on every poll and the durable table could never
//! recognise a repeat. The only thing making that path idempotent was an in-RAM
//! `last_seen` map — empty at boot — so **every restart re-credited every standing
//! balance**. Persisting `last_seen` would have made the OPPOSITE bug durable (a sweep
//! plus a same-total re-deposit between two polls loses that credit permanently, and a
//! restart is today the only thing that heals it). The key had to change, not the store.
//!
//! # The impls
//!
//! * [`SignatureWatcher`] — **the production credit path.** One
//!   [`PaymentReceived`] per finalized inbound transfer, keyed on the transaction
//!   signature AND the credited account (`soltx:{signature}:{address}:{mint}`, see
//!   [`signature_payment_ref`]). Restart-stable, sweep-stable, unique per transfer. The signature-history transport is the injected [`TransferFetcher`]
//!   seam, so the fail-closed attribution logic is exercised with no network.
//! * [`MockWatcher`] over a [`MockChain`] — a simulated devnet ledger, fully driven
//!   in tests (no network, no funds). Balance-total based, and therefore NOT
//!   restart-safe; see its `RESTART:` declaration for why that is a deliberate
//!   answer 3 rather than an oversight.
//! * [`SolanaWatcher`] — **no longer a [`Watcher`]**. It keeps the two things that
//!   were always sound: the bridge crate's
//!   [`decode_token_account`](dregg_bridge::solana_holdings::decode_token_account)
//!   balance read (under the asset's own token program) ([`SolanaWatcher::read_balance`]) and, for a trustless read, the
//!   bridge's **anchored** verifier
//!   [`prove_holding_consensus_anchored`](dregg_bridge::solana_holdings::prove_holding_consensus_anchored)
//!   (authorized-voter-bound ≥ 2/3 supermajority over a stake table DERIVED from
//!   bank state, trusted only back to the operator's governance-pinned
//!   [`WeakSubjectivityAnchor`] — never a caller-supplied stake table, which an
//!   attacker could fabricate). Its `impl Watcher` and its `last_seen` map are
//!   DELETED: a balance total is not an idempotency key, so nothing should be able
//!   to hand a balance-total watcher to something that credits money.
//!
//! **Attribution is automatic**: a payment landing on user X's derived deposit
//! address IS X's payment, because the address derivation is deterministic and the
//! caller polls with the `(user, address)` pair it derived.
