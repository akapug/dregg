//! # `TelegramHost` — the MULTI-OFFERING Telegram layer over the ONE offering core.
//!
//! [`crate::TelegramFrontend`] is offering #0's Telegram surface: it plays a single
//! [`DungeonOffering`](dreggnet_offerings::dungeon::DungeonOffering). This module gives the
//! dungeon (and every other offering) a SECOND live surface — the same "all offerings, any
//! surface" the web catalog ([`dreggnet_web::CatalogState`]) got — by driving the
//! frontend-agnostic [`OfferingHost`] through the Telegram frontend:
//!
//! - **list** — [`TelegramHost::list_offerings`] / [`TelegramHost::present_offerings_menu`]: a
//!   `/offerings`-style control message whose inline keyboard is one button per registered
//!   offering (a press opens that offering in the chat);
//! - **open** — [`TelegramHost::open`]: open a session per `(offering, chat)` on the host and
//!   present the offering's [`Surface`] on that offering's OWN message in the chat (several
//!   offerings coexist per chat; a press routes by the message it was pressed on);
//! - **advance** — [`TelegramHost::press`]: a button press → [`TelegramFrontend::collect`] the
//!   typed [`Action`] → [`OfferingHost::advance`] ONE real turn on the substrate → re-present;
//! - **verify** — [`TelegramHost::verify`]: re-verify an offering session's committed chain; ALSO
//!   routed through [`TelegramHost::press`] as the reserved [`TURN_VERIFY`] verb, so a shell's
//!   `/verify` input (or a pinned button) reaches the real re-verifier through the ONE router.
//!
//! ## The `!Send` host + the [`HostThread`] handle (mirrors `dreggnet-web`)
//! The [`OfferingHost`] owns heterogeneous offering sessions, some `!Send` (a
//! `CouncilOffering` session holds `Rc`-backed ballot caps).
//! So the host cannot be shared behind a plain `Send` handle; it lives on ONE owning thread and
//! every access is a job shipped to it — only the job's plain-data result (a [`Surface`], an
//! [`Outcome`], a [`VerifyReport`], a `Vec<OfferingInfo>`, all `Send`) crosses back. The
//! [`TelegramFrontend`] itself (the affordance-renderer + the injected transport) stays on the
//! calling thread; it never holds an offering session. This is exactly `dreggnet-web`'s
//! [`HostThread`](dreggnet_web) pattern reused for Telegram.
//!
//! ## Who reads the surface decides which projection it carries
//! A **DM** is read by one person; a **group / forum topic** is read by everyone in it, and its
//! session is ONE message that every re-present EDITS in place. So a per-viewer projection
//! ([`OfferingHost::render_for`] — a hidden hand, a sealed move) is served only in a DM; a shared
//! chat always gets the viewer-blind [`OfferingHost::render`]. On top of that structural rule, an
//! offering that DECLARES hidden information
//! ([`dreggnet_offerings::Offering::hidden_information`] — tug, automatafl) is not hosted in a
//! shared chat at all: it is refused at open ([`OpenError::HiddenInSharedChat`]) with a legible
//! redirect to a DM / the Mini App, because a public-only projection is not a playable hand.
//!
//! ## Surface → keyboard mapping
//! An offering's [`Surface`] is a deos view-tree; its cap-gated [`Action`]s are the moves. The
//! text half of the surface renders to the message body ([`crate::render::render_surface_text`]);
//! the [`Action`]s render to the inline keyboard, one button per affordance, each button's
//! `callback_data` carrying its `{turn, arg}` ([`crate::api::build_present_request`]) — identical
//! to offering #0's mapping, now driven for ANY offering. The offerings menu is a host-level
//! control keyboard whose buttons carry [`TURN_OPEN`] `{turn:"open", arg: offering index}`.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — what a live Telegram deploy adds
//! Everything here is driven at the logic level with [`crate::transport::MockTransport`] (NO
//! token, NO network). A live deploy adds only: a bot token + a reqwest-backed
//! [`HttpPost`](crate::transport::HttpPost) under [`RawBotApi`](crate::transport::RawBotApi); the
//! update loop / webhook that turns real `CallbackQuery`/`Message` updates into
//! [`TelegramHost::press`] / [`TelegramHost::open`] calls; and a durable session store (this host
//! keeps sessions in memory on its owning thread, seeded deterministically from the chat id, so a
//! restart re-derives the SAME replay-verifiable session but loses in-flight state). WeChat adopts
//! this SAME [`OfferingHost`] next — the host is unchanged; only this thin surface layer differs.
