//! **The hidden hand never lands in a message a group reads.**
//!
//! ## The bug this file exists for
//! A Telegram session's surface is ONE message per chat, and a re-present EDITS that message in
//! place (`TelegramFrontend::present_result_with` → `Transport::edit_message`). The host used to
//! paint every re-present with `OfferingHost::render_for(viewer)` — the PRESSING player's private
//! projection — including in a group. So in a group chat, alice pressing a button rewrote the one
//! shared message to show alice's card ids, and every other member of the chat read them. Tug and
//! automatafl (both hidden-information games) were unplayable-as-designed anywhere but a DM, and
//! silently so.
//!
//! ## Why the OLD test did not catch it — and what this one does differently
//! `full_parity_through_telegram.rs`'s original tug test asserted, as its SUCCESS condition, that
//! "a different seat sees a DIFFERENT hand" in a group chat, read off `MockTransport::last()`.
//! Both halves of that hid the leak:
//!
//! 1. `last()` is the most recent request in isolation. It models each render as if it went to its
//!    own private place. The reality is that both renders land in the SAME message, so the
//!    difference the old test celebrated is precisely the leak: the group's one message showed
//!    alice's hand, then bob's.
//! 2. `MockTransport` inherited the default `edit_message`, which SENDS instead — so nothing in
//!    the test rig even represented a shared message being rewritten.
//!
//! This file fixes both. `MockTransport` now really edits (stable message id, and every version
//! kept in `sent`, because a group member read each one as it was posted), and every privacy
//! assertion here is over `sent_to(chat)` — **everything that chat's readers ever saw**, not the
//! latest frame. A leak that was edited away a second later still fails these tests.
//!
//! ## What the fix is
//! - **Structural:** in a collective chat the host calls the viewer-blind `render`/`actions`, never
//!   `render_for`. A shared message can only carry the public projection, for ANY offering.
//! - **Declared:** an offering that says `Offering::hidden_information() == true` (tug, automatafl)
//!   is not hosted in a shared chat at all — a public-only projection is not a playable hand — so
//!   it is REFUSED at open with a legible redirect to a DM / the Mini App.
//!
//! The declared signal is load-bearing for the refusal because a render *differential* cannot
//! decide it: at open, before a seat is claimed, tug's per-viewer projection is byte-identical to
//! its public one (`test_the_open_render_differential_would_have_said_safe` proves exactly that).
