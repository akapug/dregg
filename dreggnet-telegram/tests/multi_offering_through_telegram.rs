//! **The driven MULTI-OFFERING proof — three heterogeneous offerings play through Telegram.**
//!
//! The single-offering `driven.rs` / `dungeon_through_telegram.rs` prove ONE offering plays over
//! Telegram. This proves the frontend-agnostic [`OfferingHost`](dreggnet_offerings::OfferingHost)
//! lifted to Telegram: a [`TelegramHost`] registers THREE distinct offerings (a dungeon, a council,
//! a market — heterogeneous `Session` types, one registry) and plays each through the SAME Telegram
//! inline-keyboard surface, with NO Telegram token and NO network (a
//! [`MockTransport`](dreggnet_telegram::transport::MockTransport)):
//!
//! - the host lists ≥ 3 offerings, and a `/offerings` menu keyboard opens any of them;
//! - a full winning DUNGEON line plays (each press → one real landed `TurnReceipt`);
//! - a COUNCIL propose → vote (two members) → enact plays, a non-member is a real refusal;
//! - a MARKET list → sealed bids → settle clears (value moves, conservation-checked);
//! - an unoffered turn is refused BEFORE the substrate;
//! - `verify` re-verifies each committed chain by replay.
