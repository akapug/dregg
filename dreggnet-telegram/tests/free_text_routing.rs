//! **FREE-TEXT input routing — the runtime routes a plain-text message into a SELECTED text
//! affordance.** All over [`MockTransport`] (no token, no network), the same seam split the
//! runtime shell is built on.
//!
//! The gap this closes: a text-input offering (the collaborative document, hosted Hermes, names,
//! compute settle) presents affordances that SOLICIT free text
//! ([`Action::wants_text`](dreggnet_offerings::Action::wants_text)), but the runtime only routed
//! fixed commands + numeric `/act` args, so a plain-text message a user typed fell through to
//! [`TextDecision::Ignored`] and the offering could never be driven in-chat.
//!
//! It is now SELECTABLE and DELIBERATE: a button press on a text affordance ARMS that specific
//! `(turn, arg)` for the chat ([`HostPress::TextArmed`]); the NEXT plain-text message becomes THAT
//! affordance's text payload and advances one real turn (the executor stays the sole referee).
//! With nothing armed, plain messages are ordinary chatter — Ignored (never swallowed, even with a
//! text offering open: the old `find(wants_text)` captured every message the moment any text
//! offering was open, and always into the FIRST text affordance). A command is still a command.
