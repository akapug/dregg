//! **THE PER-IDENTITY INVENTORY ISOLATION FALSIFIER, DRIVEN THROUGH THE TELEGRAM HOST.**
//!
//! The bot↔game review's last live CRITICAL: every Telegram player shared ONE inventory, because
//! the eight RPG feature surfaces (trade / inventory / craft / …) were mounted on the ONE shared
//! `SharedWorld::demo("Adventurer")` catalog host — so one presser could forge an item and it
//! appeared in another presser's inventory. This proves the fix over the real host router (no
//! token, no network — `MockTransport`):
//!
//! - **(a) ISOLATION** — two different Telegram users (`ALICE` / `BOB`) have DISJOINT RPG worlds:
//!   alice forges a Greatblade on `craft`, it is on HER `inventory`, and bob's `inventory` — a
//!   live, seeded world of his own — does not hold it.
//! - **(b) THE REGRESSION GUARD** — a SHARED multi-party table (`council`) is still shared, NOT
//!   split per-identity: alice proposes and BOB approves the SAME proposal, reaching the 2-of-2
//!   quorum and enacting — only possible if both press ONE shared council.
