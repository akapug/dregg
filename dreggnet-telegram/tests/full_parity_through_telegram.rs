//! **The driven FULL-PORTFOLIO parity proof — Telegram registers the SAME 18 offerings the web
//! catalog does, and the viewer threads through the surface.**
//!
//! `multi_offering_through_telegram.rs` proved THREE heterogeneous offerings play through Telegram.
//! This closes the gap the audit found: Telegram (and WeChat) registered only three each while the
//! web catalog ([`dreggnet_web::demo_host`]) registers eighteen — the five games (incl. automatafl +
//! multiway-tug) and the eight do-once RPG feature surfaces were ABSENT because their crates were not
//! deps. Now [`telegram_default_host`] builds through the ONE shared registrar
//! (`dreggnet_catalog::build_full_catalog` — docs/BOT-SHARED-BACKEND-DESIGN.md). This drives:
//!
//! - **BOTH-POLARITY offering-set parity against the LIVE web catalog**: the Telegram host,
//!   driven over [`MockTransport`], registers exactly the key set `dreggnet_web::demo_host()`
//!   registers — an offering missing from Telegram fails, and an offering Telegram grows that web
//!   lacks fails too (no hand-copied list on either side of the comparison);
//! - a newly-registered game (**automatafl**) is REACHABLE and renders a NON-EMPTY surface (a
//!   CoordGrid board degrades to a text grid on the text-only Telegram renderer — expected, not a
//!   silent drop);
//! - the **multiway-tug hidden hand** threads the viewer *to a DM*: a seated player, projected
//!   through the frontend's own derived identity, sees THEIR OWN card ids while the opponent's hand
//!   stays fog — the per-viewer projection the `hidden_hand_web.rs` shape proves on the web, on the
//!   chat surface that may actually carry it. (This bullet used to claim the same for a GROUP, with
//!   "a different seat sees a DIFFERENT hand" as the success condition. That was the leak, not the
//!   feature — a group's session is ONE message everyone reads. See
//!   `tests/hidden_information_never_shared.rs`.)
//! - a real turn drives through a newly-registered game (tug's opening `comp` lands a receipt), and
//!   the committed chain re-verifies.
