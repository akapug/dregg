//! **Two offerings live in ONE chat, both addressable.**
//!
//! ## The bug this file exists for
//! A Telegram session was keyed by chat alone (`tg:{chat_id}`), and the host kept ONE offering key
//! per chat (`active: HashMap<SessionId, String>`) over ONE message slot. So opening a second
//! offering STOLE the chat's surface: the first offering's message stopped being re-presented, its
//! keyboard went stale, and a press on it answered `NotOffered` (or, worse, resolved against the
//! new offering because the chat's `presented` list had been overwritten). Two people in one group
//! could not play different games, and one person could not keep a document open beside a board.
//!
//! ## The fix, and what is deliberately NOT changed
//! The `OfferingHost` already addressed a session as `(key, id)`, so two offerings in one chat were
//! ALREADY two separate host sessions — the collision was purely in the SURFACE. So the host
//! session id stays chat-scoped (its deterministic seed, its durable resume log, and its Mini App
//! deep link are all untouched), and only the surface splits: one message per `(chat, offering)`,
//! named by `TelegramFrontend::surface_id` (`tg:-5#tug`).
//!
//! A press then routes by **the message it was pressed on** (`CallbackQuery::message_id`, the Bot
//! API's own `callback_query.message.message_id`) — which is the honest answer to "which of these
//! boards did you press". A synthesized press that names no message (a `/act` command, a Mini App
//! `sendData` round-trip, an older test) falls back to the chat's most recent surface, so the
//! single-offering UX is exactly as it was.
