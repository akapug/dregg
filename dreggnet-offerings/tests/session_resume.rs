//! **The session-resume seam, DRIVEN over the real dungeon substrate** — the last durable-store
//! closure: an [`OfferingHost`] session survives a restart by REPLAYING its move-log to the
//! identical committed state, never by trusting a serialized blob.
//!
//! - a live session records its **reproducible public input** (the seed + the ordered landed
//!   advances) as a [`SessionMoveLog`], written through to an attached [`SessionResumeStore`];
//! - across a simulated RESTART (drop the host, boot a fresh one over the same store) the session
//!   REOPENS by re-driving its log — to the byte-identical committed-state commitment (non-vacuous:
//!   a session at genesis, or driven differently, commits differently);
//! - a TAMPERED log (a forged / ineligible advance spliced in) is REFUSED by the executor on
//!   re-drive — the resume fails, no forged session is left live (fail-closed);
//! - the in-memory store round-trips (record open + landed, load, enumerate).
