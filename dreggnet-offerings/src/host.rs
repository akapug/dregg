//! # `OfferingHost` — the frontend-agnostic multi-offering registry.
//!
//! The generic offering router that today only exists Discord-side (`discord-bot/offering.rs` —
//! a `DiscordOffering` registry + per-offering `Store<O>` sessions + `route_component`), **lifted
//! to the core** so every frontend (web, Telegram, WeChat) drives ALL offerings through ONE object.
//!
//! An [`OfferingHost`] is a registry of heterogeneous [`Offering`]s by **key** (`"dungeon"`,
//! `"council"`, `"market"`) plus their live per-`(offering, session)` state. It exposes the SAME six
//! offering verbs a frontend needs — [`list_offerings`](OfferingHost::list_offerings) /
//! [`open`](OfferingHost::open) / [`actions`](OfferingHost::actions) /
//! [`advance`](OfferingHost::advance) / [`render`](OfferingHost::render) /
//! [`verify`](OfferingHost::verify) — driving ANY offering purely through its [`Offering`] trait.
//!
//! ## The Session-erasure shape (the load-bearing design)
//!
//! [`Offering::Session`] is an ASSOCIATED type: a [`dungeon::DungeonSession`](crate::dungeon), a
//! council session, and a market session are three *different, unrelated* types (one even holds
//! `!Send` `Rc`-backed ballot caps — see the discord-bot `Store` note). They cannot live in one
//! `HashMap<_, Session>`. So the host does NOT collapse the `Session` type: each registered offering
//! is stored behind a **type-erased [`OfferingSlot`] trait object** ([`Hosted<O>`]) that owns its own
//! `HashMap<SessionId, O::Session>` privately and exposes the offering verbs with the session type
//! **erased behind the [`SessionId`] handle**. The host holds `BTreeMap<key, Box<dyn OfferingSlot>>`
//! — heterogeneous offerings, one registry, the polymorphic `Session` preserved (never boxed into a
//! lossy `Any`, never forced `Send`).
//!
//! ## Reuse across frontends
//!
//! This host is the frontend-agnostic core the Discord adapter's per-offering `Store` generalises:
//! `dreggnet-web` drives it (a multi-offering web catalog); a Telegram / WeChat frontend adopts the
//! SAME host unchanged (each maps the host's [`Surface`]/[`Action`]s onto its own controls). Because
//! some sessions are `!Send`, a frontend that needs a `Send + Sync` handle (an axum `State`) confines
//! the host to one owning thread and ships jobs to it — exactly what the discord-bot `Store` does and
//! what `dreggnet-web`'s host wrapper does; the host itself stays a plain synchronous object.
