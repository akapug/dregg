//! # DreggNet Cloud — the frontend-agnostic Offering/Session core.
//!
//! The dungeon (`discord-bot/fiction.rs`) is **offering #0** — the first instance of a
//! general pattern: a **confined, verifiable, paid, per-session thing** hosted on the real
//! dregg substrate. This crate extracts that pattern into a reusable [`Offering`] trait and a
//! [`Frontend`] abstraction, so Telegram / WeChat / web frontends and hosted-Hermes / grain
//! offerings plug into ONE core. See `docs/DREGGNET-CLOUD-OFFERINGS.md` (the design).
//!
//! ## The shape every offering shares (proved end-to-end by the dungeon)
//! 1. **A per-session confined thing** — a channel/thread/chat hosts one live session.
//! 2. **A confined intelligence/app** — the dungeon's jailed narrator; elsewhere a hosted
//!    Hermes agent or a Sandstorm grain.
//! 3. **Real verifiable turns** — each input is a real executor turn → a [`TurnReceipt`];
//!    [`Offering::verify`] re-checks the whole chain (the executor is the source of truth — a
//!    jailbroken narration cannot change the world).
//! 4. **Payment-gated** — a paid action debits a run-credit ([`RunCost`]); empty → free tier.
//! 5. **Optionally collective** — write-once ballots + quorum when a crowd drives one session
//!    (the ballot lives one layer up, in the orchestrator/frontend; the core resolves the
//!    *typed [`Action`]* the crowd picked, on the substrate).
//!
//! ## The abstraction
//! An [`Offering`] is `open` / [`actions`](Offering::actions) / [`advance`](Offering::advance)
//! / [`verify`](Offering::verify) / [`render`](Offering::render) / [`price`](Offering::price).
//! Its `render` returns a **deos affordance [`Surface`]** (a [`deos_view::ViewNode`]); its
//! [`Action`]s are **cap-gated affordances** (the `{turn, arg}` shape a `ViewNode` button
//! fires); an [`advance`](Offering::advance) is **one real turn** whose [`Outcome`] is
//! `Landed(TurnReceipt)` or `Refused(reason)` — the same anti-ghost shape the dungeon uses.
//!
//! ## Frontends — Discord is #0; Telegram, WeChat, web are the SAME offerings, different surfaces
//! The offering/session/payment/verify CORE is frontend-agnostic (this crate carries **no**
//! serenity/Discord dependency). A [`Frontend`] is an **affordance-renderer**: it derives a
//! per-platform [`DreggIdentity`], `present`s an offering's [`Surface`] + [`Action`]s, and
//! `collect`s a platform event back into a typed `(SessionId, Action, DreggIdentity)`. The
//! core resolves that action on the substrate; the executor stays the sole referee on every
//! surface. [`mock::MockFrontend`] is the reference renderer the tests drive.
