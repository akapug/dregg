//! **A reference [`Frontend`] for tests** — a headless affordance-renderer that records what
//! it was asked to present and maps a synthetic interaction event back into a typed offering
//! [`Action`]. It is the frontend-agnostic proof: the SAME [`Surface`] / [`Action`]s the core
//! produces round-trip through a renderer with **no Discord / serenity** anywhere. A real
//! frontend (the discord-bot's `deos_surface.rs`, a Telegram bot, the web surface) is the same
//! shape with a live surface instead of an in-memory map.
