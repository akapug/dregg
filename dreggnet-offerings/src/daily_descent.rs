//! # `daily_descent` — THE DESCENT: a daily, provably-fair, permadeath procgen roguelite.
//!
//! The flagship's core (docs/GAME-STRATEGY.md Phase 1). Every day, ONE dungeon — a single
//! **drand-beacon-seeded** procgen world that everyone plays. You can DIE (real committed
//! defeat + hardcore, un-undoable character death). Your persistent character carries in and
//! earns on the run. A **no-cheat leaderboard** ranks a verified run — and refuses a forged one.
//!
//! It welds three things that already exist on the real substrate into the daily loop:
//!
//! 1. **The beacon-seeded daily world** ([`DailyBeacon`](procgen_dregg::beacon::DailyBeacon) →
//!    [`daily_seed`](procgen_dregg::daily_seed)). Today's dungeon is a pure function of today's
//!    verified drand round: **unpredictable until the round matures** (no grinding a favourable
//!    day — a forged beacon is refused by the pairing check), **identical world-wide**, and
//!    **verifiable by re-derivation**. [`daily_scene`] draws the day's world (theme, warden
//!    strength, depth, room descriptions) from procgen's VERIFIED `dregg-dice` stream.
//! 2. **Permadeath, on the real executor** (the [`dungeon_on_dregg::bloodgate`] pattern). The
//!    day's world is a stakes-forward trial: an HP floor (`FieldGte(hp, 1)`) means a blow you
//!    could not survive is refused, and a reckless line strands you into a real committed
//!    **DEFEAT** passage (`downed -> END`). A run can be genuinely LOST. Every tooth here is
//!    compiler-emitted from a scene condition, so the world the offering plays and the world the
//!    leaderboard re-executes are byte-identical (no augmentation).
//! 3. **The persistent, hardcore character** ([`crate::character`]). Level / class / earned XP
//!    carry across days; a hardcore death is [`WriteOnce`]-final and PERSISTS — a re-opened dead
//!    character loads dead. This is the un-forgeable "I survived" the leaderboard leans on.
//! 4. **The no-cheat leaderboard** ([`ugc_dregg`]). The day's world is a published
//!    [`Universe`](ugc_dregg::Universe); a run is a [`Completion`](ugc_dregg::Completion) the
//!    board accepts ONLY if [`verify_completion`](ugc_dregg::verify_completion) re-executes it to
//!    the WIN (seized the hoard) against a fresh identically-seeded world. A forged / incomplete
//!    run is REFUSED.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - **The beacon.** Verification is real drand `quicknet` interop (a BLS pairing check against
//!   the pinned group key). *Fetching* today's `(round, signature)` from a drand node is the
//!   named client seam ([`procgen_dregg::beacon`] docs); a [`DailyBeacon`] is built from an
//!   already-fetched round. The driven test seeds "today" from a REAL published round.
//! - **The leaderboard surface.** The ranking substrate is [`ugc_dregg`] (re-execute-to-win,
//!   ranked by turns). The daily-reveal UX (the bot's midnight freeze/reveal) and the web
//!   spectator page are the frontends above this core — named, not built here.
//! - **What the full flagship adds next:** the bot's daily-reveal loop, the web spectator /
//!   provenance page, and meta-progression-on-death (a death that unlocks a persistent boon).
//!   This module is the earning core those surfaces render.
