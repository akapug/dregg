//! # Session-resume — the [`OfferingHost`](crate::OfferingHost)'s durable-store seam.
//!
//! An [`OfferingHost`](crate::OfferingHost) holds each session's live state **in memory** (behind
//! the type-erased `OfferingSlot` — some sessions are `!Send`, `Rc`-backed cells). That state is
//! LOST on restart. This module closes that seam the way the rest of the platform's durable stores
//! do (the discord-bot's `CharacterStore` / the `/gallery` registry): **store only the reproducible
//! public input, and reopen by REPLAY — never a trusted serialized blob.**
//!
//! ## What a session's reproducible public input is
//!
//! A session is deterministic from its [`SessionConfig`] seed + the ordered [`advance`]s that
//! LANDED (the [`Offering`] contract: `open(cfg)` is a pure function of the seed, and
//! `verify_by_replay` guarantees re-driving the ordered landed choices from a fresh identically
//! seeded `open()` reproduces exactly the committed state chain). So a [`SessionMoveLog`] — the seed
//! + that ordered `(action, actor)` list — is a **complete, un-forgeable** description of a session:
//!
//! [`Offering`]: crate::Offering
//! [`advance`]: crate::Offering::advance
//! [`SessionConfig`]: crate::SessionConfig
//!
//! - It is not a state snapshot a peer could tamper with — it is the *inputs*, and the executor
//!   re-derives the state. A forged / ineligible advance spliced into the log is **refused on
//!   re-drive** (the same anti-ghost gate a live move hits), so a tampered log cannot reopen to a
//!   forged state — it fails to reopen at all.
//! - It is small and append-only (one row per landed turn), the natural durable shape.
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! [`SessionResumeStore`] is the persistence trait — [`record_open`](SessionResumeStore::record_open)
//! at open, [`record_landed`](SessionResumeStore::record_landed) after each landed advance,
//! [`forget`](SessionResumeStore::forget) on close, [`load`](SessionResumeStore::load) /
//! [`all`](SessionResumeStore::all) on boot. [`InMemoryResumeStore`] is the reference impl the tests
//! drive; the durable **sqlite** impl is the discord-bot's follow-up (exactly as `SqliteGalleryStore`
//! / `SqliteCharacterStore` back their sync traits). The host writes THROUGH an attached store on
//! open/advance and reopens with [`OfferingHost::resume`](crate::OfferingHost::resume) /
//! [`resume_all`](crate::OfferingHost::resume_all) — replaying the log to the identical committed
//! state.
