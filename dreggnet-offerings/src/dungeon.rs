//! **Offering #0 — the dungeon.** The `discord-bot/fiction.rs` `RealSession` logic, factored
//! out of the Discord frontend into a [`DungeonOffering`] that implements the frontend-agnostic
//! [`Offering`] trait over `dungeon_on_dregg`'s real `WorldCell`.
//!
//! What was Discord-coupled in `fiction.rs` (serenity embeds, ballot buttons, the round/tally,
//! the narrator gate) splits cleanly:
//! - the **substrate seam** — deploy the Keep, run genesis, apply a choice as ONE real
//!   cap-bounded turn, record the [`Playthrough`], re-verify by replay — is THIS module (the
//!   [`DungeonSession`] is the old `RealSession`, verbatim in substance).
//! - the **ballot / tally / plurality** is the *orchestrator's* job (collective-choice); the
//!   core resolves the single typed [`Action`] the crowd picked.
//! - the **embed / buttons** is the *frontend's* job; the core renders a deos [`Surface`].
//! - the **narrator credit gate** is the *frontend's* job; the core names the [`RunCost`].
//!
//! The executor is the SOURCE OF TRUTH: a legal move lands a real `TurnReceipt`; an illegal one
//! (a killing blow past the HP floor, a second grab of a `WriteOnce` relic, climbing a one-way
//! stair, an over-budget ward) is a real `WorldError::Refused` that commits nothing — the
//! anti-ghost tooth. `verify` re-drives a fresh identically-seeded world-cell through the
//! recorded choices ([`verify_by_replay`]); a forged/reordered record fails.
