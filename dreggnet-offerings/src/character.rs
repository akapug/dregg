//! # `character` — a PERSISTENT, LEVELING character bound to a player's identity.
//!
//! The dungeon (offering #0) is one-shot: [`DungeonOffering::open`](crate::dungeon::DungeonOffering::open)
//! deploys a FRESH, identically-seeded world-cell each run — the *identity* persists (a stable
//! [`DreggIdentity`]) but the *character* does not. `dungeon-on-dregg`'s [`progression`] module
//! already holds a PROVEN character sheet — XP / level / class / abilities as real gated cell
//! state on the real executor (a level-up is a `FieldGte(xp, threshold(L))`-gated turn; a class
//! ability is `FieldEquals(class, .)`-gated; class is `WriteOnce`) — but it was STANDALONE. This
//! module WIRES it into the dungeon flow, keyed by the player's identity, so a character carries
//! and LEVELS across runs.
//!
//! ## The seam (load / save)
//!
//! A [`CharacterStore`] is the load/save seam: a returning player's [`CharacterSheet`] is LOADED
//! on [`open`](AdventurerOffering::open) (a new player starts fresh) and SAVED on
//! [`save`](AdventurerOffering::save). [`InMemoryCharacterStore`] is the in-process impl the tests
//! drive; the **durable sqlite store is the bot's — a NAMED follow-up**, not built here. The
//! character CELL is deployed fresh + seeded from the loaded sheet each run (the identity gives
//! the deterministic cell *identity*; the sheet gives the carried *state*).
//!
//! ## The teeth stay REAL (nothing here is app bookkeeping)
//!
//! - **XP is EARNED from real run outcomes.** Bloodying the gate-warden and seizing the hoard are
//!   real dungeon turns the executor admits; iff such a move LANDS, the session grants XP to the
//!   character cell via [`progression::gain_xp`] — itself a real `StrictMonotonic(xp)`-gated turn.
//!   A dungeon move the executor REFUSES (a killing blow past the HP floor) grants NOTHING (the
//!   anti-ghost binding: no real outcome, no XP).
//! - **A forged XP grant is REFUSED.** XP moves ONLY through the sanctioned `GAIN_XP_METHOD`; a
//!   grant presented under any other method is a real executor refusal (the cell program is
//!   default-deny: an unknown method on a `Cases` program with dispatch cases is
//!   `NoTransitionCaseMatched`). See [`Character::hero_cell`] + the driven anti-cheat test.
//! - **Level-up is the existing `FieldGte(xp, threshold)` gate.** A returning low-XP character
//!   cannot level — the CARRIED xp is exactly what the kernel predicate reads (non-vacuous across
//!   the run boundary).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - The [`CharacterStore`] seam is in-memory here; the durable **bot-owned sqlite store is a
//!   named follow-up**. The character sheet is a plain value ([`CharacterSheet`]) the durable store
//!   will persist by identity — the seam is exactly the boundary it plugs into.
//! - XP is granted for two outcomes (bloodying the warden, seizing the hoard); the grant is a
//!   SESSION-level binding of a real character-cell turn to a real dungeon-cell turn (two cells,
//!   two turns). The dungeon's own `verify_by_replay` chain is untouched.
//! - A fuller RPG (inventory persistence, reputation, cross-universe character, a recorded +
//!   replay-verified character-turn chain) builds ON this seam — named, not built here.
