//! # `descent_tournament` — a WEEKLY TOURNAMENT over The Descent
//!
//! A thin hook that runs a [`dreggnet_tournament`] no-cheat bracket **over The Descent**
//! ([`crate::daily_descent`]). Each ROUND is a fresh, **beacon-seeded daily descent** — the
//! same day's world for every competitor that round (fair) — and a competitor **ADVANCES
//! only on a VERIFIED WIN**: their run of the day is re-executed to the hoard through
//! ugc-dregg's audited [`verify_completion`](ugc_dregg::verify_completion) no-cheat gate. A
//! **forged / incomplete / lost** run does NOT advance. The champion is the last verified
//! survivor.
//!
//! ## How it welds the two layers
//!
//! * **The round universe is a daily descent.** [`descent_rounds`] turns each round's
//!   beacon epoch into today's committed seed ([`procgen_dregg::daily_seed`]), draws the
//!   day's permadeath world ([`crate::daily_descent::daily_scene`]), and publishes it as the
//!   round's [`ugc_dregg::Universe`] ([`crate::daily_descent::DailyDescent::universe`]). So a
//!   round IS a real no-cheat leaderboard over the flagship's own day — the tournament and
//!   the daily-descent offering deploy the byte-identical world.
//! * **A competitor submits a Descent win.** The winning line of a day's descent is a pure
//!   function of the day's warden HP + depth (both drawn from the beacon seed), so
//!   [`descent_winning_line`] reads them off the shared, published day source and produces
//!   the honest fight-heal-press-key-descend-seize line. An [`honest_descender`] plays it; a
//!   [`forging_descender`] retcons a step (drops the key) and is refused on re-verification.
//!
//! ## "Weekly" — the schedule
//!
//! A single-elimination bracket needs `ceil(log2 N)` rounds; a WEEKLY tournament maps those
//! rounds onto successive **days of the week**, each a fresh beacon-seeded daily. The bracket
//! ITSELF (fair rounds, verify-gated advancement, a champion) is what is real here; the LIVE
//! weekly cadence (one round per real day, entry windows, the reveal) and PRIZES (glory over
//! `$DREGG` services, never yield) are the named residual — the frontend/orchestrator above
//! this core. This module produces the champion; a scheduler decides *when* each round runs.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! REAL: the bracket over The Descent, verify-gated on ugc-dregg's no-cheat gate (a forged
//! run cannot advance; the champion is a verified survivor; each round is a real daily-descent
//! leaderboard). NAMED, not built: the live weekly schedule/entry-window/reveal, seeding by
//! skill (seeding is entry order), and prize settlement (glory, not yield).
