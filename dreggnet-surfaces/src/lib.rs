//! # `dreggnet-surfaces` — the DO-ONCE frontend batch.
//!
//! An [`Offering`](dreggnet_offerings::Offering)'s [`render`](dreggnet_offerings::Offering::render)
//! returns a [`Surface`](dreggnet_offerings::Surface) — and a `Surface` IS a
//! [`deos_view::ViewNode`]. Every frontend (the native cockpit, `deos-view`'s web/discord/
//! telegram/wechat renderers, the test [`MockFrontend`](dreggnet_offerings::mock::MockFrontend))
//! is a *renderer of that one tree*. So writing `render -> ViewNode` ONCE per feature lights up
//! EVERY surface — the do-once path the frontend plan (`docs/FRONTEND-PLAN.md`) confirmed is ~80%
//! of the work. [`dreggnet_market`](../dreggnet_market/index.html) was the only prior new-domain
//! Offering; this crate adds four more, following that reference:
//!
//! * [`trade::TradeOffering`] — a **playable market #2** over [`dreggnet_trade`]: list a good, then
//!   settle a real atomic **asset swap** (the seller's owned note crosses to the buyer for a
//!   trade-coin, each move a real owner-signed transfer turn — a non-owner / paid-out buyer is a
//!   real executor refusal). The listings render as a `Section{Menu}`; the actions fire real turns.
//! * [`inventory::InventoryOffering`] — an owned-notes surface over [`dreggnet_asset`]: a player's
//!   notes (gear / cards / trophies) as a `Table` (name / rarity / kind / provenance / holder), the
//!   provenance + holder read off the real substrate, plus one interactive move — **gift** a note to
//!   a friend (a real owner-signed transfer turn; a re-gift of a note you no longer hold is a real
//!   executor refusal).
//! * [`cheevo::CheevoShowcase`] — a **read-surface** over [`dreggnet_cheevo`]: the earned soulbound
//!   achievements + their proofs (the predicate, the witness, the run's turn count, the seal). Read
//!   by design — a cheevo is SOULBOUND (earned by a verified run, never transferred), so the
//!   substrate exposes no write to surface here.
//! * [`guild::GuildPage`] — the roster + the aggregate **verified-clears** leaderboard over
//!   [`dreggnet_guild`] (every clear passed the no-cheat verify), plus one interactive move —
//!   **admit** a pending applicant (a real cap grant + committed membership turn; a non-member's
//!   write is a real `CapabilityNotHeld` refusal).
//!
//! ## Batch 2 — the next four feature crates as Offerings
//!
//! * [`craft::CraftOffering`] — a **playable forge loop** over [`dreggnet_craft`]: pick a recipe,
//!   the forge consumes real material notes (the sink) + rolls a provably-fair quality, and mints a
//!   real owned output — `advance` fires a real craft turn (a below-floor / consumed-input craft is
//!   a real refusal).
//! * [`companion::CompanionOffering`] — a **playable hatch + collection** over [`dreggnet_companion`]:
//!   hatch a companion from a fair draw (a real owned note) + raise it through XP-gated committed
//!   turns; the collection renders as a `Table` of your companions + their live levels.
//! * [`tavern::TavernOffering`] — a **read-surface posting board** over the shared hub
//!   [`dreggnet_tavern`] models: presence + the LFG board + the party roster (render-only — the live
//!   node/mozjs post path stays off this light layer).
//! * [`party::PartyOffering`] — a **playable roster + fork ballot** over [`dreggnet_party`]: a seat
//!   acts in its role (a cross-role misplay is a real cap refusal) and the party resolves a fork via
//!   `advance_collective` (a real quorum-certified signed ballot into the shared world).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! *Playable* Offerings (their `advance`/`advance_collective` fire real committed turns): trade,
//! craft, companion, party — and, at one move each, inventory (**gift**) + guild (**admit**). Pure
//! *read-surfaces* (`advance` is a read-only refusal, `render` is the payload): cheevo (soulbound —
//! nothing to write) and tavern (a read mirror + a `join` link-out to the live async node). The
//! do-once reach is real: each `render` is a plain [`ViewNode`] tree, so the web one-line register
//! ([`register_surfaces`]) AND the discord/telegram/wechat renderers inherit all eight with no
//! per-surface code — proven by the cross-backend golden tests (`tests/golden_render.rs`) that walk
//! each surface through the real `text`/`telegram`/`wechat`/`web` backends. NAMED NEXT (not built here): the
//! discord command shells (the generic `/offering` adapter gives discord these for free once
//! registered); a booted-node tavern post path (the mozjs-weight async surface). The *games'*
//! Offerings — once gated here as Tier C — are BUILT in their own crates and registered in the web
//! catalog: `dregg_multiway_tug::surface::TugOffering` (per-viewer `render_for` hidden-hand fog) and
//! `dregg_automatafl::surface::AutomataflOffering` (the `ViewNode::CoordGrid` board, rendered by
//! every backend).
