//! MASKED DECRYPT-TO-SHARES — the last un-built seam of the output-boundary
//! pipeline, made real (the §8 frontier item of `docs/deos/OUTPUT-BOUNDARY-MPC.md`).
//!
//! ## The seam this closes
//!
//! The output-boundary MPC PoC (`crate::mpc`) measured the crossing at
//! milliseconds, but its input step — "the threshold-BFV partial-decrypt-INTO-
//! shares" — was MODELLED by sharing the true decrypted coefficients
//! (`share_int` on cleartext). Between the BFV-encrypted folded curves and the
//! secret-shared MPC crossing there was still one un-built protocol step.
//!
//! ## The construction: mask, THEN decrypt (one-time pad over `Z_t`)
//!
//! A dedicated "partial-decrypt-into-shares" primitive is not needed. Additive
//! homomorphism already gives it, composed from pieces the stack HAS:
//!
//!   1. Each party `i` samples a uniform mask vector `r_i ∈ Z_t^K`, encrypts it,
//!      and homomorphically adds `Enc(r_i)` to the folded curve ciphertext:
//!      `ct' = ct ⊞ Enc(r_0) ⊞ … ⊞ Enc(r_{n-1})` — n more carry-free adds on a
//!      noise budget sized for millions.
//!   2. The network decrypts `ct'` (in production: the EXISTING federation
//!      threshold-decrypt stack — `federation/src/threshold_decrypt.rs`'s
//!      t-of-n Shamir machinery pointed at the BFV key; here: the PoC keypair).
//!      What opens is `y = (m + Σ r_i) mod t` — **a one-time-padded value**,
//!      uniform on `Z_t` and EXACTLY independent of the curve `m` (proven by
//!      enumeration in `pad_is_exact_and_secret_independent`). Decrypting it in
//!      public is safe; nobody learns a curve coefficient.
//!   3. The mod-t additive shares of `m` are then LOCAL: party 0 takes
//!      `σ_0 = (y − r_0) mod t`, party `i>0` takes `σ_i = (−r_i) mod t`, so
//!      `Σ σ_i ≡ m (mod t)` — each party's share is a function of its own mask
//!      (plus the public `y`), no interaction.
//!   4. One boundary bridge (`a2b_mod_t`) converts the mod-t arithmetic shares
//!      to boolean shares — a secret-shared exact integer sum of the n shares
//!      (`secure_add`, width `w = ⌈log₂ n·t⌉`) followed by `n−1` oblivious
//!      conditional subtractions of the public `t` — and the UNCHANGED
//!      Beaver-triple crossing (`mpc_crossing`) runs and reveals only `(p*,V*)`.
//!
//! So the seam dissolves the same way the BFV→TFHE scheme-switch did (R4's
//! move): not by building the exotic adapter, but by restructuring so only
//! already-safe openings happen. The threshold-decrypt that production needs is
//! the one the federation already runs; what this module adds is the masking
//! protocol that makes its OUTPUT safe to open, plus the mod-t → boolean bridge.
//!
//! ## Honest scope (stated like the sibling PoCs)
//!
//! - **REAL:** the value channel. The mask is an exact one-time pad over `Z_t`
//!   (enumeration-proven); the opened `y` carries zero information about the
//!   curve; the mod-t share algebra and the `a2b_mod_t` bridge are real MPC on
//!   real shares; the crossing is the unchanged measured protocol; correctness
//!   is KAT-checked against direct decryption and the plaintext reference.
//! - **PoC-scoped:** the decrypt of `ct'` uses the in-process secret key (the
//!   same PoC posture as `bfv_fold`); production points the existing federation
//!   threshold-decrypt at it. The parties are simulated in one process.
//! - **NAMED, not built:** the decryption NOISE channel. A decryption's noise
//!   term can leak beyond the plaintext (the IND-CPA-D caveat); production
//!   threshold decryption adds smudging noise to the partial decryptions —
//!   standard, orthogonal to the value-channel construction here.
