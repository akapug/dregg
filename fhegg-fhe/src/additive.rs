//! The CARRY-FREE ADDITIVE fold — codex Round-3 Q1's Tier-0 speed lever, MEASURED.
//!
//! The exact-integer TFHE clear (`crate::fhe_clear`) folds the per-order unary
//! price-bucket increments with `FheUint32::sum`, and the MEASURED envelope
//! (`MEASURED-ENVELOPE.md`, `HBOX-24CORE-ENVELOPE.md`) showed the load-bearing
//! finding: a multi-block radix add **carry-propagates**, and carry propagation
//! is PBS-class (~13 ms/element even in the deferred-carry tree-sum), so the
//! aggregation DOMINATES the clear (up to 45× the O(K) crossing). The estimates'
//! "addition ≈ µs, the cheap primitive" is only true for an ADDITIVE scheme.
//!
//! This module builds that additive scheme for real and measures it. The carrier
//! is **BFV** (`fhe.rs`) — an exact-quantized `R_q = Z_q[X]/(X^n+1)` ring scheme,
//! SIMD-batched into `n` plaintext slots, whose ciphertext addition is a native
//! modular polynomial add: **no carry propagation, no bootstrap, no PBS**. This
//! is exactly the "exact quantized BFV/BGV for the carry-free fold" of
//! `docs/deos/FHEGG-CODEX-ROUND3.md` §B/Q1 (CKKS is the approximate cousin, not
//! available in tfhe-rs; BFV is the exact additive path and the one codex named
//! for the *auction* fold specifically — CKKS is for the T-step PDHG search).
//!
//! The SIMD packing is the structural win over TFHE. TFHE packs one integer per
//! `FheUint32` and must sum each of the K buckets separately: 2·K bucket-sums,
//! each over ~N/2 carry-propagating adds → O(N·K) PBS-class work. BFV packs the
//! WHOLE K-bucket increment vector of one order into a SINGLE ciphertext (K ≤ n
//! slots), so folding N orders is just **N ciphertext additions total** from
//! zero accumulators (one running sum for demand, one for supply), each a
//! carry-free poly add that updates all K buckets at once. O(N) carry-free adds
//! vs O(N·K) PBS adds.
//!
//! The crossing (`D[p] ≥ S[p]`) is a comparison, and — codex's hard boundary —
//! "there is no comparison from additive homomorphism alone." So the crossing is
//! NOT done here; it stays on TFHE (the measured ~10 s O(K) crossing) via a
//! scheme-switch (CHIMERA/PEGASUS). The correctness harness below recovers p*/V*
//! from the decrypted curves purely to CHECK the fold against the plaintext
//! reference — that clear-domain crossing is not part of the measured additive
//! cost and is labelled as such.
//!
//! Mint-safety: the fold's quantization is the deployable floor/ceil quantizer
//! proven mint-safe in `metatheory/Market/MintSafeQuantization.lean`
//! (`mint_safe_floor_ceil`: floor inputs, ceil outputs, at step Δ; the integer
//! gate `Σ⌈vout/Δ⌉ ≤ Σ⌊vin/Δ⌋` provably forbids `Σvout > Σvin`). See `mint_safe`.
