//! fhEgg Stage-2 — NO-VIEWER FHE uniform-price clearing.
//!
//! The honest thesis under test (docs/deos/DREX-NO-VIEWER-SURPASS.md,
//! docs/deos/FHEGG-KERNEL.md): a batch uniform-price call auction is an
//! AGGREGATION, not a matching. Orders are unary price-bucket increments;
//! the aggregate demand/supply curves are a bootstrap-free homomorphic SUM
//! of those increments; and the clearing price is a single monotone crossing
//! that costs O(K) comparisons, independent of N.
//!
//! This module implements BOTH:
//!   * a plaintext reference clear (`reference_clear`) — the ground truth, and
//!   * the FHE clear (`fhe_clear`) — computed entirely on TFHE ciphertexts,
//!     decrypting ONLY the public clearing price p* and aggregate volume V*.
//!
//! The economic model (well-defined, monotone, so plaintext == FHE):
//!   * K public price buckets p = 0..K.
//!   * A BID order (buy) with limit L, qty q: willing to buy at any price
//!     p <= L. Its demand increment adds q to buckets 0..=L. So cumulative
//!     demand D[p] = sum of q over bids with L >= p, non-increasing in p.
//!   * An ASK order (sell) with limit L, qty q: willing to sell at any price
//!     p >= L. Its supply increment adds q to buckets L..K. So cumulative
//!     supply S[p] = sum of q over asks with L <= p, non-decreasing in p.
//!   * Matched volume at p is min(D[p], S[p]); it is maximized at the crossing.
//!     Because D is non-increasing and S non-decreasing, the predicate
//!     c[p] = [D[p] >= S[p]] is a single downward step (1..1,0..0). We define
//!     the clearing price p* = (#{p : D[p] >= S[p]}) - 1 = the largest p at
//!     which demand still meets supply. This makes the crossing a HOMOMORPHIC
//!     SUM of K comparison bits — exactly the "O(K) crossing" of the kernel.
//!
//! The unary-increment encoding is what keeps the limit L SECRET: the trader
//! locally expands the order into a K-vector of {0/q} and encrypts each entry.
//! The server never learns L; it only sums ciphertexts. This is the honest
//! "orders stay encrypted" model (Cryptobazaar unary encoding).
