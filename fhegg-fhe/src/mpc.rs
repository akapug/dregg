//! OUTPUT-BOUNDARY MPC — the ADVERSARIAL no-viewer crossing (codex Round-4 gold).
//!
//! `docs/deos/OUTPUT-BOUNDARY-MPC.md` is the design; this is the working PoC.
//!
//! ## The construction, in one paragraph
//!
//! The additive RLWE/BFV fold (`crate::additive::bfv_fold`) turns N encrypted
//! orders into two aggregate curve ciphertexts — encrypted demand `D[p]` and
//! supply `S[p]` over K price buckets — with cheap carry-free adds
//! (`ADDITIVE-FOLD-ENVELOPE.md`: ~10^5× the exact-integer TFHE fold). The clearing
//! price `p*` is DELIBERATELY public. So we do NOT pay for the comparison inside
//! TFHE and we do NOT scheme-switch BFV→TFHE. Instead, at the OUTPUT BOUNDARY the
//! `n` federation parties **partial-decrypt only the aggregate curve into additive
//! secret shares** (native to threshold BFV — each party applies its key share,
//! yielding a share of the plaintext; no exotic CHIMERA/PEGASUS adapter) and run
//! the crossing `p* = argmax_j min(D[j],S[j])` in a **secret-shared MPC**,
//! revealing ONLY `p*` and the cleared volume `V*`. This module is that MPC.
//!
//! ## Why this is ADVERSARIAL no-viewer, not a policy claim
//!
//! The comparison runs over additive shares with a real GMW/Beaver-triple online
//! phase. Every message a party sends is a one-time-pad-masked bit (`x ⊕ a`, `a`
//! a fresh uniform shared triple bit), so any coalition of **fewer than the
//! threshold `t` parties** sees a view that is uniform and independent of the
//! individual curve coefficients — it learns NOTHING beyond the revealed
//! `(p*, V*)`. That is a *cryptographic threshold bound*, not "we promise not to
//! look". The honest caveat (stated in the design + the tier docs): `≥ t`
//! colluding parties CAN reconstruct — "nobody even if all collude" is impossible
//! for clearing over hidden data. Output-boundary MPC shrinks the trust to its
//! minimum: a threshold, one clearing, reveal-only-`p*`, and NO standing master
//! decryption key (unlike threshold-FHE, where a colluding key-share subset can
//! decrypt any submitted ORDER ciphertext forever).
//!
//! ## What "reveal only (p*, V*)" means (the leakage argument)
//!
//! The crossing computes `p* = argmax_p min(D[p], S[p])` (ties to the lowest p)
//! by an OBLIVIOUS argmax — a data-oblivious scan whose gate schedule is fixed by
//! `(K, b)`, not by the inputs — and opens ONLY the argmax index `p*` and its
//! volume `V* = min(D[p*], S[p*])`. No sign bit `[D[p] ≥ S[p]]`, no per-bucket
//! comparison, and no curve height is ever opened. (The earlier "open the sign
//! vector, take the last crossing" shortcut both mis-cleared — the volume peak can
//! sit one bucket above the crossing — AND leaked the crossing index, which is
//! strictly more than `p*`.) Every other protocol message is a one-time-pad-masked
//! Beaver reveal — uniform and input-independent — so a simulator given only
//! `(p*, V*)` reproduces the whole view distribution (the masked pad plus the p*-
//! and V*-bit openings). The real view therefore leaks nothing beyond `(p*, V*)`.
//!
//! ## What is real here vs. abstracted (honest)
//!
//! - **REAL:** boolean (GF(2)) additive secret sharing among `n` parties; a real
//!   Beaver-triple AND gate whose opened values are one-time-pad masked; a real
//!   bit-sliced secure `≥` comparator; a real secure `min`; an oblivious argmax
//!   crossing (secure MUX on a secret compare bit). No party ever holds a
//!   plaintext curve coefficient; only `(p*, V*)` open.
//! - **PREPROCESSING (standard MPC assumption):** the Beaver triples are produced
//!   by a simulated offline dealer (the SPDZ "offline phase"). In production the
//!   triples come from OT/HE preprocessing AMONG the parties — the ONLINE phase
//!   below is information-theoretically secure GIVEN the triples, and it is the
//!   online phase that carries the reveal-only-`p*` property.
//! - **ABSTRACTED (labelled):** the threshold-BFV partial-decrypt-INTO-shares step
//!   is modelled by sharing the true committed curve coefficients (`share_int`).
//!   The novel part — the MPC comparison on real secret shares — is what runs. The
//!   RLWE→shares partial decryption is native threshold-FHE, not a scheme switch;
//!   that is the seam this construction DISSOLVES (design doc §4).

//   * Each order's per-bucket contribution is additively secret-shared DIRECTLY
//     over the ring Z_{2^b} (`share_arith`). Any coalition of ≤ n-1 parties sees
//     shares that are UNIFORM and PERFECTLY (information-theoretically)
//     independent of the secret — no assumption to break, secure against
//     UNBOUNDED compute. (Contrast: a BFV ciphertext of the same value is only
//     COMPUTATIONALLY hiding — an unbounded adversary recovers the plaintext by
//     breaking LWE.)
//   * The fold — aggregate demand/supply per bucket — is each party LOCALLY
//     summing its own shares mod 2^b (`fold_arith`): FREE, no communication, no
//     crypto, and the result is again a perfect additive sharing of the sum.
//   * To feed the existing boolean Beaver-triple comparator, the folded
//     arithmetic shares are converted to boolean shares once at the boundary
//     (`a2b`, a real MPC subprotocol — a secret-shared ripple-carry sum of the
//     parties' arithmetic shares). Then the UNCHANGED `mpc_crossing` runs and
//     reveals ONLY (p*, V*).
//
// Threshold (stated honestly): additive (n-of-n) sharing is PERFECTLY HIDING
// against any ≤ n-1 SEMI-HONEST parties given the (simulated-dealer) Beaver
// triples — the online phase opens only one-time-padded bits and is itself
// information-theoretically secure. Robust/malicious security and dealer-free
// IT triple generation are the classic HONEST-MAJORITY regime (t < n/2, BGW);
// SPDZ-style MACs push to all-but-one but put a computational assumption back in
// the (offline) preprocessing. All-collude reconstruction is unavoidable for
// clearing over hidden data — the theorem, not a gap. This PoC establishes the
// semi-honest, below-threshold, PERFECT-HIDING fold; §8 of the design doc keeps
