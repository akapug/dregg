//! **EVM proof-of-holdings** — the ETH/Base analog of the non-custodial Solana
//! `prove_holding_consensus`. Given a light-client-verified execution `state_root`
//! (from [`crate::finality::verify_finalized_update`]) and an EIP-1186 `eth_getProof`
//! proof chain, prove that a holder holds `balance` of an ERC-20 `token` at that
//! finalized state — **with custody intact** (nothing moves; we open a proof over the
//! holder's balance slot in the token contract's own storage trie).
//!
//! ## The EIP-1186 proof chain
//!
//! 1. **Account (state) trie**: `state_root --MPT--> keccak256(token) -> RLP([nonce,
//!    balance, storageHash, codeHash])`. This binds the token contract account and, in
//!    particular, its `storageHash` — the root of the contract's storage trie.
//! 2. **Storage trie**: `storageHash --MPT--> keccak256(slot_key) -> RLP(balance)` where
//!    `slot_key = keccak256(pad32(holder) ‖ pad32(balances_slot))` is the Solidity
//!    `mapping(address => uint256)` slot for `balances[holder]`.
//!
//! The Merkle-Patricia trie verification is done by the maintained **`alloy-trie`**
//! (`verify_proof`) and RLP by **`alloy-rlp`** — the same code path Reth/Alloy use.
//! We do NOT hand-roll the Patricia trie.
//!
//! ## The forgery this binds against (Solana lesson, ported)
//!
//! `bridge/src/solana_holdings.rs` learned that a balance blob is only authoritative if
//! it sits under the RIGHT owner (the SPL Token program), else an attacker forges any
//! balance from an account under their own program. The EVM analog: a `balance` value is
//! only authoritative if it is proven at `keccak256(pad(holder) ‖ pad(slot))` inside the
//! storage trie whose root is the token CONTRACT's `storageHash`, which is itself proven
//! at `keccak256(token)` inside the light-client-verified `state_root`. Point the storage
//! proof at the wrong contract, the wrong slot, or an unrelated state root and every step
//! fails closed. Custody stays with the holder — we only open a read proof.
