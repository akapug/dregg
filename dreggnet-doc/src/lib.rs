//! # `dreggnet-doc` — the COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT offering.
//!
//! The dungeon is offering #0 (a confined narrative world). This is the
//! **productivity/collaboration** one, and it is the same five-part shape:
//!
//! 1. **A per-session confined thing** — one live shared document (a real
//!    `dregg_cell::Cell`, committed over its `fields_root`).
//! 2. **Real verifiable turns** — an EDIT is one real
//!    [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor::execute`] turn through the document substrate's
//!    executor entry ([`dregg_doc::MultiEditorDoc::edit`]), landing a genuine
//!    finalized [`TurnReceipt`] on the editing collaborator's own per-agent chain.
//! 3. **The referee is the executor + the document soundness core, never prose** —
//!    an *unauthorized* edit (an actor without the region's edit cap) is refused
//!    **in-band by the executor** (`TurnError::CapabilityNotHeld`); a *conflicting*
//!    edit (one that would leave the document carrying an unresolved antichain or
//!    field clash) is refused by `dregg-doc`'s own conflict semantics. Nothing
//!    commits on a refusal (the anti-ghost tooth).
//! 4. **Payment-gated** — [`Offering::price`] names a per-edit [`RunCost`]
//!    (free tier by default; a resolution is always free).
//! 5. **Verifiable end to end** — [`Offering::verify`] re-drives the WHOLE edit
//!    chain from genesis through the real executor and checks that the document
//!    reproduces, byte for byte, at every step. A forged edit fails.
//!
//! ## What is consumed, and what is NOT re-implemented
//!
//! Every document semantic comes from [`dregg_doc`] — the Pijul-shaped patch
//! theory (`DocGraph` / `Patch` / `Op` / `History`), the categorical merge
//! (`merge` = the pushout as a total graph union), the conflict model
//! (`content`'s first-class antichain / field-clash [`ConflictRegion`]s + the
//! two-regime [`Regime`] classifier), provenance/blame, and the executor-drive
//! seam ([`MultiEditorDoc`], where a per-region edit cap is a c-list capability
//! the executor's `check_cross_cell_permission` gate enforces). This crate adds
//! **no CRDT, no merge rule, no conflict rule** of its own: it is the *session +
//! affordance + verification* layer that presents the substrate as an
//! [`Offering`].
//!
//! ## The session model (the deep model — N real per-agent chains over ONE ledger)
//!
//! A [`DocSession`] holds **one** [`dregg_doc::MultiEditorDoc`] — N distinct editor
//! cells (distinct agents), each optionally holding the shared region cell's edit
//! cap, all driving turns through **one** `TurnExecutor` over **one** `Ledger`.
//! Because the executor keys the receipt-chain head (`previous_receipt_hash`) and
//! the agent nonce by *cell id*, each collaborator keeps their **real cross-edit
//! per-agent chain**: collaborator A's second edit chains off A's own first, with
//! A's nonce monotone, even when B edited in between. The session no longer
//! re-bases a fresh single-editor document per edit (which restarted every actor at
//! nonce 0 with no `previous_receipt_hash`); the per-agent chain is now the genuine
//! executor chain, not a document-commitment shadow of it.
//!
//! The session also holds the document's [`History`] (the patch chain — the document
//! IS its history), an ordered roster of collaborators (each with a [`Role`], which
//! decides whether their editor cell holds the region's edit capability), and the
//! [`CommittedEdit`] log — one entry per landed turn, binding the turn's
//! deterministic core (`turn_hash` / `effects_hash` / pre- and post-state roots) and
//! the document's commitment after it. The `turn_hash` transitively binds the
//! editor's prior receipt hash (via `Turn::previous_receipt_hash`), so a
//! spliced/reordered chain moves the turn hash and breaks replay.
//!
//! Two workarounds the earlier single-editor model carried are now **retired**:
//! - **The per-agent chain is real** (was: re-based per edit). The session drives
//!   [`MultiEditorDoc::edit`] with the editing collaborator's slot, so their nonce
//!   and receipt chain advance across the session — [`DocSession::editor_chain`]
//!   exposes it, and replay reconstructs it identically (the executor's default
//!   timestamp is `0`, so every receipt hash is deterministic and reproducible).
//! - **An edit's prose rides [`Action::text`]** (was: on [`Action::label`]). A
//!   document edit's inserted text / a title's new value is a first-class string
//!   payload on the affordance, round-tripped losslessly through a [`Frontend`]'s
//!   present/collect — the affordance's `label` is now purely the human prompt.
//!
//! - **The conflict gate is the fold, not `PullRequest::merge`.** A live session is
//!   the *fast-forward* case (the new history is the old history plus one patch), so
//!   the session gates each 1-patch edit on the FOLD of the new history with
//!   dregg-doc's own detector ([`content`] + [`Regime`]) — the same detector
//!   `PullRequest::conflicts` reads. dregg-doc's `three_way` now honors its base, so
//!   `PullRequest`'s pushout also lands a superseding resolution on a fast-forward
//!   (`tests/driven.rs` pins it); the `PullRequest` path stays the right thing for a
//!   genuine *fork* (a review branch).
//!
//! ## What a fuller collaborative document still adds (named honestly)
//!
//! - **Concurrent divergent replicas.** Here edits are *sequenced* through one
//!   executor (one node, one linear ledger fold). True concurrent authoring (two
//!   editors composing on divergent replicas, then a branch-and-stitch merge) is the
//!   patch algebra's job (`dregg_doc::merge` / the two-device-sync path), layered
//!   ABOVE this — each replica a `MultiEditorDoc`, the stitch a further turn.
//! - **The review-branch PR path as an offering surface.** `three_way` is fixed and
//!   a fork's merge lands; wiring `dregg_doc::review` (threaded comments + approvals
//!   as receipted atoms) and `PullRequest` into a *review* affordance surface is the
//!   next offering, not this one.
//! - **Rich inline marks** (`dregg_doc::marks`), **presence / cursors** (ephemeral,
//!   no substrate analogue), and **character-level granularity** (`Doc::edit`'s token
//!   LCS; this offering's edits are span-level `Add`/`Delete`, the substrate's own
//!   atom granularity) round out the surface.
