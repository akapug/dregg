//! `cosmos-lightclient`: the **inbound Cosmos/IBC socket** — dregg VERIFYING a
//! Cosmos chain by proof, never by trusting an RPC tag or a committee.
//!
//! This is the Cosmos analog of the ETH sync-committee verifier
//! ([`eth-lightclient`]) and the Solana Tower-BFT verifier
//! ([`dregg-bridge::solana_consensus`]). It has two accept paths, both
//! fail-closed:
//!
//! 1. [`verify_cosmos_header`] — advance a trusted Tendermint state to an
//!    untrusted [`SignedHeader`] via the audited informalsystems
//!    light-client verifier ([`tendermint_light_client_verifier`]). It enforces
//!    the whole Tendermint rule set: the validator-set hash binds the header, a
//!    stake-weighted **>= 2/3** of the voting power signed the commit (real
//!    Ed25519 verification), the header is within the trusting period, its time
//!    is monotonic and not from the future, and (for an adjacent block) the
//!    trusted `next_validators_hash` matches the untrusted validator set. On
//!    success it yields an unforgeable [`VerifiedHeader`] token — the only way to
//!    obtain one is to pass verification (its fields are private; there is no
//!    other constructor). The header's `app_hash` is the commitment the
//!    membership path opens into.
//!
//! 2. [`verify_cosmos_membership`] — verify a two-op ICS-23 proof (an `iavl`
//!    module-store exist proof + a `tendermint`/`simple` multistore exist proof)
//!    that `key -> value` is committed under a verified `app_hash`, via the
//!    audited [`ics23`] crate. This is exactly the chained verification ibc-rs
//!    performs: the iavl proof computes the module sub-root, the tendermint proof
//!    proves that sub-root under the app_hash, and the top root must equal the
//!    app_hash. Any tamper (a forged leaf, a wrong value, a swapped sub-root)
//!    breaks the chain and is refused.
//!
//! 3. [`ProvenCosmosFact`] — the bound result: `(chain_id, height, store_key,
//!    key, value)` proven at a [`VerifiedHeader`]. It is the Cosmos analog of
//!    `dregg-bridge::solana_holdings::ProvenHolding`.
//!
//! 4. [`bank`] — the holdings edge: [`foreign_holding_fields`] decodes a
//!    bank-store balance fact (`0x02 ‖ len ‖ address ‖ denom -> math.Int` /
//!    legacy `sdk.Coin`) into the plain-primitive [`ForeignHoldingFields`]
//!    `{chain_tag, holder, asset, amount, snapshot, consensus_proven}` the
//!    governance layer consumes — chain-id pinned, over-`u128` refused. The
//!    OUTBOUND direction (dregg as a CosmWasm client Cosmos verifies) remains a
//!    named followup; it waits on the wrap.
//!
//! Header advances come in both Tendermint shapes: **adjacent** (height + 1,
//! bound by `next_validators_hash`) and **non-adjacent skipping** (any higher
//! height, bound by the trust-threshold overlap rule — see
//! [`verify_cosmos_header`]).
//!
//! # Trust boundary (honest)
//!
//! The consensus arithmetic, the Ed25519 commit-signature verification, the
//! validator-set hashing, and the ICS-23 proof hashing are all real (delegated to
//! the audited reference libraries, not hand-rolled). What is *assumed* is the
//! weak-subjectivity anchor: the caller must supply a genuinely trusted starting
//! [`TrustedCosmosState`] (a header + validator set the operator has verified out
//! of band). From there each advance is trustless. This is the same
//! weak-subjectivity posture every Tendermint light client (Hermes, ibc-rs) has.
