//! `dregg-pq-testkit` — install the Lean-verified post-quantum cores in a TEST process.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! `dregg-pq` is a light leaf: it never links the Lean archive, and it answers a PQ
//! operation only through a function pointer some host installed. With no core installed
//! and no declared bypass it does the only correct thing — `process::abort()`
//! (`dregg-pq/src/audit.rs`). That is right in production and it is right in a test.
//!
//! The consequence is that a test binary in a crate which cannot link the archive
//! (`dregg-blocklace`, `dregg-token`, `dregg-turn`, `dregg-cell-crypto`,
//! `dregg-lightclient`, `dregg-auth` — all deliberately light) dies as a bare SIGABRT
//! the first time it derives, signs with, or verifies an ML-DSA key. Whether it died was
//! decided by test ORDER, i.e. by `--test-threads`: at 1 thread an earlier test that
//! happened to construct a heavier object could install the cores and carry the rest.
//!
//! This crate is the ONE place a test process gets those cores. A crate adds it to
//! `[dev-dependencies]` and calls [`install`] before its first PQ operation.
//!
//! # This does not weaken the gate, and it is not a bypass
//!
//! `DREGG_ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ` does not appear in this crate and must not. That variable
//! routes the operation onto the unaudited `fips204` / `ml-kem` crates, which is the exact
//! substitution the gate exists to prevent. What [`install`] does is the opposite: it makes
//! the extracted, Lean-verified cores the authority in the test process, so the tests run
//! against the SAME objects a deployed node runs against instead of against a third-party
//! crate.
//!
//! Every install is EXPORT-GATED (`*_core_available()` is checked inside `dregg-pq`'s
//! shared install functions). An archive that does not export a core installs nothing for
//! that direction and the refusal at the point of use still stands — so a stale or
//! marshal-only archive still fails the test loudly rather than quietly downgrading it.
//! [`installed`] reports, per direction, whether a core is actually live, so a test that
//! wants to assert it got the verified object can.
//!
//! # Why a crate rather than a dev-dep on `dregg-lean-ffi` in each crate
//!
//! The install is seven calls whose arguments are `dregg-lean-ffi` symbol names. Copied
//! into six crates' test helpers, a seventh core (or a renamed export) means six edits and
//! five of them silently stay on the old set. `node/src/lib.rs::install_verified_pq_cores`
//! and `sdk/src/runtime.rs` are already two copies of this list; this is the one a test
//! reaches for, and `grep -rl dregg-pq-testkit` answers "which test binaries link the
//! archive for PQ" in one command.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Measured, not assumed. A test binary that DOES call [`install`] links the PQ closure out
//! of the archive; one that merely has this crate in `[dev-dependencies]` and never calls it
//! links nothing extra — the linker pulls archive members by reference, and an unreferenced
//! `dregg_lean_ffi` pulls none. Measured on macOS at `4f39452c1`: `dregg-pq`'s own lib-test
//! binary, which has had a `dregg-lean-ffi` dev-dep since `f52d8ed91` and does not use it,
//! is 2.2 MB with zero Lean runtime symbols; `dregg-pq`'s `mldsa_lean_verify` test, which
//! does use it, is 126.8 MB with 234. So the cost is per-BINARY-that-calls, not per-crate.
