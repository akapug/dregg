//! # `dreggnet-trade` — scam-proof P2P player trading.
//!
//! Two players who do not trust each other exchange OWNED assets with **no trusted
//! middleman**: "I give you X iff you give me Y." This crate binds a
//! [`dreggnet_asset`] transfer (a real owner-signed spend of an owned note) to a
//! sealed-escrow leg from `starbridge-escrow-market`, so the exchange is a
//! **trustless atomic swap**:
//!
//! * **asset ↔ asset** — a cosmetic for a cosmetic, a trophy for crafting-mats;
//! * **asset ↔ $DREGG-value** — a listing: offer an asset for a price.
//!
//! ## The binding — how atomicity is achieved without a middleman
//!
//! The [sealed escrow](starbridge_escrow_market) is the **coordination ledger**: a
//! host cell whose committed heap tracks each leg's `Empty → Deposited → Consumed`
//! status one-shot, and whose [`settle`](starbridge_escrow_market::settle) consumes
//! BOTH legs in a single step only when both are present. A [`Trade`] rides that
//! switch:
//!
//! 1. **deposit** ([`TradeWorld::deposit`]) — a party commits its leg. An ASSET leg
//!    is a real [`AssetWorld::transfer`](dreggnet_asset::AssetWorld::transfer) of the
//!    owned note into a neutral **escrow-custodian** holder (the executor's signature
//!    gate refuses a non-owner — you cannot offer an asset you do not own); a $DREGG
//!    leg moves value from the party's wallet into the trade's value custody. Either
//!    way the sealed escrow records a live leg. Until settlement the value/asset sits
//!    in neutral custody — neither party can walk with the other's leg.
//! 2. **settle** ([`TradeWorld::settle`]) — the sealed escrow verifies BOTH legs are
//!    present + unconsumed and consumes them atomically; only then does the trade
//!    cross each leg to its counterparty (custody → the other party). No half-open
//!    trade: if one leg is missing, [`settle`](starbridge_escrow_market::settle)
//!    refuses and nothing crosses.
//! 3. **reclaim** ([`TradeWorld::reclaim`]) — the ghost defence. If a counterparty
//!    never deposits, the depositor reclaims its own leg (the sealed escrow consumes
//!    it one-shot, so it can never then be settled) and the custody asset/value
//!    returns to the depositor — **made whole**. The half-open-trade exit-scam is
//!    defeated by construction.
//!
//! ## What travels with the item — provenance
//!
//! An asset's [`AssetId`](dreggnet_asset::AssetId) and its origin minter are carried
//! unchanged across the whole lineage. After a trade the item's provenance
//! (mint → into escrow → to the new owner) **re-verifies**
//! ([`TradeWorld::verify_provenance`]): a rare drop's rarity is a checkable hash
//! chain, not marketing. The new owner can then transfer it; the old owner cannot
//! (its version is spent).
//!
//! ## Honest scope — no pay-to-win
//!
//! Tradable goods are **cosmetics / provenance-trophies / crafting-mats** only —
//! never raw power. Character XP / level / earned power are un-buyable gated turns
//! and are NOT assets in this layer. The scam-proofness is *by construction* (the
//! sealed escrow's both-present-atomic + one-shot teeth + the asset transfer's
//! signature gate), not by policy.
//!
//! ## Named residuals (not built here)
//!
//! * an **order book / auction house** over sealed-auction (this layer settles ONE
//!   matched trade at a time; [`Listing`] is a single offer, not a book);
//! * a **market frontend** (wallet / stall UI);
//! * a **fee sink to the treasury** (a marketplace cut at settle — no settlement
//!   path takes a cut today).
