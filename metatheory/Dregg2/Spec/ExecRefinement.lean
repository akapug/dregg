# Dregg2.Spec.ExecRefinement — the first refinement square: `Exec ⊑ Spec`.

This module proves `Dregg2.Exec.Kernel ⊑ Dregg2.Spec.{Conservation,Guard,Authority}` — the
l4v `Design ⊑ Abstract` move. The refinement square:

```
        Refines
   k  ───────────▶  a
   │                │
   │ exec k t       │ abstract step (Spec law)
   ▼                ▼
   k' ───────────▶  a'
        Refines
```

Two tractable projections of the square are proved:

  1. **Conservation refinement** (`exec_refines_conservation`): an `exec`-committed step's
     per-cell balance deltas satisfy `Spec`'s `conservedInDomain Domain.balance` — i.e.
     `exec_conserves` IS `Spec`'s `Σδ = 0` law over `Bal = ℤ`.

  2. **Authority refinement** (`exec_authz_refines_guard`): `Exec.authorizedB` admitting a
     turn implies the corresponding abstract `Spec.Guard.admits` is `true`. Ownership is
     tied to `Spec.Authority.confers_refl`; held caps are tied to `Graph.has` on the
     reconstructed graph.

  3. **The simulation relation** (`Refines`, `exec_step_refines`): the conservation and
     authority projections are proved; the residual operational thread (an abstract small-step
     LTS for full bisimulation) is `-- OPEN:`-marked with a precise statement.

Also proves a second refinement square for the content-addressed record kernel
(`Exec.RecordKernel ⊑ Spec`), landing on the same abstract `Domain.balance` law.

Faithful `Prop`s; `#assert_axioms` on all keystones; the `-- OPEN:` is prose, not an open hole.

/-! ## §1 — Conservation refinement: `Exec.exec_conserves` IS `Spec`'s `Σδ = 0` over ℤ.

The executable kernel conserves a SINGLE cleartext-ℤ ledger (`Exec.total`, a `Finset.sum`).
`Spec.Conservation` states `Σδ = 0` per `Domain`, parametric over a value monoid `Bal`, and
consumes the deltas as a `List Bal`. We exhibit the kernel's per-cell balance deltas as the
`List ℤ` that `conservedInDomain Domain.balance` reads, and prove a committed step's deltas
conserve — bridging `Exec.total`/`Finset.sum` to `Spec`'s `List.sum` exactly as `Coherence`
bridged the hyperedge (`Finset.sum_map_toList`).

So the toy single-ℤ ledger conservation is the `balance`-domain case of the multi-domain
abstract law: `Bal := ℤ`, `Domain := Domain.balance`. -/

/-- **`refineConservation s s'`** — the per-cell balance deltas of a step `s ⟶ s'`, packaged
as the `List ℤ` that `Spec.conservedInDomain` consumes. We enumerate the live accounts of the
*pre*-state (`exec` never changes `accounts`, only `bal`) and read off `s'.bal c - s.bal c`
per cell. This is the kernel's debit/credit ledger viewed as a conservation `deltas` list —
the `Bal = ℤ` instance of the abstract delta list. -/
noncomputable def refineConservation (s s' : KernelState) : List ℤ :=
  s.accounts.toList.map (fun c => s'.bal c - s.bal c)

/-- The list-sum of the per-cell deltas equals `total s' - total s` (over the SHARED account
set — `exec` preserves `accounts`). The `Finset.sum_map_toList` bridge from `Spec.Coherence`,
applied to the ℤ ledger: it turns the `List.sum` `Spec` reads into the `Finset.sum` `Exec`
uses. -/

/-- **KEYSTONE 1 — `exec_refines_conservation`.** An `exec`-committed step's
per-cell balance deltas satisfy `Spec`'s balance-domain conservation
(`conservedInDomain Domain.balance`, i.e. `Σδ = 0` over `Bal = ℤ`). This is the conservation
PROJECTION of the refinement square: `Exec.exec_conserves` (the single-ℤ ledger preserves
`total`) IS, with no remainder, `Spec`'s `Σδ = 0` law instantiated at `Bal = ℤ`,
`Domain.balance`. The toy single-domain ledger is the `balance` case of multi-domain
conservation. -/

/-- The same conservation projection cast through the abstract monoid keystone: a committed
step's prior balance-domain total `pre` is unchanged by adding the step's deltas — the
`Bal = ℤ` instance of `Spec.conservation_over_monoid`. Confirms the executable refinement is
literally the abstract law's ℤ specialization, not a parallel re-proof. -/

  conservation_over_monoid Domain.balance pre (refineConservation k k')
    (exec_refines_conservation k k' turn h)

/-- Multi-domain placement: a committed `exec` step conserves the `balance` domain of
the four-domain abstract law. We package the step's deltas as `TurnDeltas` that are the
kernel's ℤ ledger in the `balance` slot and empty (vacuously conserving) elsewhere, and read
off `turnConserves`-style balance conservation. This is the precise sense in which the
executable kernel inhabits ONE domain of `Spec.multi_domain_independent`. -/

/-! ## §2 — Authority refinement: `Exec.authorizedB` refines `Spec.Guard` / `Spec.Authority`.

The executable cap gate `Exec.authorizedB caps turn : Bool` checks ownership-or-held-cap,
fail-closed. `Spec.Guard` says every gate is a `Guard.admits`; `Spec.Authority` says authority
is a capability `Graph` with `confers`/`Holds`. We refine the executable gate onto BOTH:

  * onto `Spec.Guard` — `authorizedB` is realized, with no remainder, as a `firstParty`
    `Guard` over the turn (the decidable intra/cross-vat gate of `VatBoundary.Positional`);
  * onto `Spec.Authority` — the ownership branch (`actor = src`) is the reflexive conferral
    `confers c c` (`Authority.confers_refl`), and the held-cap branch witnesses
    `Graph.has actor src` on a graph reconstructed from `Exec.caps`. -/

section AuthorityRefinement

-- The verify oracle for the `Guard`. The executable gate is FIRST-PARTY (decidable now), so
-- the witnessed branch is never used; we take the oracle as a parameter exactly as `Guard`
-- and `Coherence` do, so the refinement is stated over the same seam.
variable {Statement Witness : Type} [Verifiable Statement Witness]

/-- The `Request` the executable authority gate reads is exactly the `Turn` (the actor / src /
dst / amount facts) — NOT a `Nat`. The abstract `Guard` reads it first-party. -/
abbrev ExecRequest := Turn

/-- **`execAuthGuard caps`** — the executable cap gate as a first-party `Spec.Guard`.
`Guard.firstParty (fun t => Exec.authorizedB caps t)`: it admits a turn iff the kernel's
decidable ownership-or-held-cap check passes. The `Statement` carrier is free (no witnessed
branch — the gate is decided *now*, the positional regime). -/
def execAuthGuard (caps : Caps) : Guard ExecRequest Statement :=
  Guard.firstParty (fun t => authorizedB caps t)

/-- **KEYSTONE 2 — `exec_authz_refines_guard`.** The executable gate
`authorizedB` admitting a turn ⇒ the corresponding abstract `Spec.Guard.admits` is `true`. The
decidable kernel gate REFINES the abstract `Guard` demand: every turn the machine admits, the
abstract gate admits. (The `↔` even holds — the refinement is exact, not merely sound — but
the soundness direction is the load-bearing one for `Exec ⊑ Spec`.) -/
theorem exec_authz_refines_guard (caps : Caps) (turn : Turn) (w : Statement → Witness)
    (h : authorizedB caps turn = true) :
    Guard.admits (execAuthGuard (Statement := Statement) caps) turn w = true := by
  unfold execAuthGuard
  rw [Guard.admits_firstParty]
  exact h

/-- The refinement is EXACT (`↔`): the executable gate admits *iff* the abstract `firstParty`
guard admits. So `authorizedB` is realized as a `Spec.Guard.admits` with no remainder — the
same single gate object that unifies authorization / preconditions / program-constraints /
caveats (`Spec.Guard`'s thesis). PROVED. -/
theorem exec_authz_iff_guard (caps : Caps) (turn : Turn) (w : Statement → Witness) :
    Guard.admits (execAuthGuard (Statement := Statement) caps) turn w = true
      ↔ authorizedB caps turn = true := by
  unfold execAuthGuard
  rw [Guard.admits_firstParty]

/-- A *committed* `exec` step's turn passes the abstract authority `Guard` — composing
`Exec.exec_authorized` (no state change without authority) with the gate refinement. So the
fact "the kernel only moves resource under authority" is, on the abstract side, "the authority
`Guard` admitted the turn". PROVED. -/
theorem exec_step_passes_guard (k k' : KernelState) (turn : Turn) (w : Statement → Witness)
    (h : exec k turn = some k') :
    Guard.admits (execAuthGuard (Statement := Statement) k.caps) turn w = true :=
  exec_authz_refines_guard k.caps turn w (exec_authorized k k' turn h)

/-! ### §2.1 — Refining onto `Spec.Authority`: ownership = reflexive `confers`, held cap =
`Graph.has`.

`Spec.Authority` models authority as a `Graph CellId Rights` with `confers` (non-amplifying
delegation) and `Graph.has` (the holder reaches a target). We reconstruct a Spec graph from
`Exec.caps` and show the executable gate's two branches land on it: ownership is the reflexive
self-conferral `confers c c`, and a held node/endpoint-write cap witnesses `Graph.has`. -/

/-- The **connectivity-skeleton** rights carrier for the reconstructed `execGraph`: `Unit`.
This is NOT a claim that the executable model lacks rights — it is the deliberate carrier for
the CONNECTIVITY projection. `execGraph h c` reads a `Bool` ("does `h`'s slot confer a
node/endpoint-write edge to `c.target`?"); a single slot may hold MANY caps to one target with
DIFFERENT rights, so there is no well-defined rights label to hang on a connectivity edge. The
connectivity graph's edge-set is therefore keyed purely by target — which is exactly why its
rights carrier is `Unit` (`⟨t,()⟩` is the unique connectivity edge to `t`). The genuine RIGHTS
attenuation order lives on `ExecCapRights` below (and on `Exec.confRights`/`ExecAuth`), where it
is a real `Finset Auth` ⊆-lattice with teeth — see §2.2. Keeping the connectivity carrier `Unit`
and the rights carrier `Finset Auth` SEPARATE is faithful: connectivity (Granovetter reach) and
rights (attenuation) are distinct projections of one cap, and the unowned effect kernels
(`Exec.EffectsAuthority`, `Exec.TurnExecutorFull`, …) consume `execGraph`'s `⟨t,()⟩` connectivity
edges, while the genuine `granted.rights ≤ held.rights` discipline is the `ExecCapRights` order. -/
abbrev ExecRights := Unit

/-! ### §2.2 — The GENUINE executable rights lattice `ExecCapRights := Finset Auth` (DE-VACUIFIED).

`ExecRights = Unit` above is the connectivity carrier; on it `confers` collapses to "same
target" (the rights conjunct is `() ≤ () = True`, vacuous). The REAL rights an executable cap
carries are a `List Auth` (`Exec.capAuthConferred`), whose attenuation order is **subset of
conferred authorities** (`granted ⊆ held`, the `is_attenuation` of `cell/src/capability.rs`).
The deduplicated, order-insensitive carrier with a genuine `SemilatticeInf` + `OrderTop` is
`Finset Auth` (= `Exec.ExecAuth`), so it slots DIRECTLY into `Spec.Authority`'s
`{Rights} [SemilatticeInf Rights] [OrderTop Rights]` interface. We state the rights-bearing
`confers` / non-amplification theorems over THIS carrier — where `≤` is a real `⊆` test that can
FAIL on an amplifying grant — and connect it to executable caps via `Exec.confRights`.
This is the de-vacuification: every theorem below has a strict-attenuation witness AND an
amplification-rejection witness (§2.3), neither of which `Unit` can grow. -/

/-- **`ExecCapRights`** — the genuine executable rights lattice: a `Finset Auth` ordered by `⊆`
(attenuation), with `⊤ = Finset.univ` (full authority). The real order the executable caps live
in; `a ≤ b` is a non-trivial subset test, NOT the `Unit` collapse. (`= Exec.ExecAuth`.) -/
abbrev ExecCapRights := ExecAuth

example : SemilatticeInf ExecCapRights := inferInstance
example : OrderTop ExecCapRights := inferInstance

/-- Lift an executable cap into a rights-labelled `Spec.Cap` over the GENUINE rights lattice:
target preserved, rights = the cap's actual conferred authority (`Exec.confRights`). This is the
rights-AWARE Spec image of a cap (contrast `execGraph`, the connectivity skeleton). -/
def capToSpec (target : Label) (c : Authority.Cap) : Cap Label ExecCapRights :=
  ⟨target, confRights c⟩

/-! ### §2.3 — Non-amplification over `ExecCapRights`, WITH TEETH.

The headline `granted.rights ≤ held.rights` over the genuine lattice. `attenuate` narrows real
rights (`Exec.attenuate_confRights_le`); we lift it to `confers` on rights-labelled Spec caps,
then exhibit BOTH a strict-attenuation witness (held has a right granted lacks) AND an
amplification-rejection witness (`confers` is FALSE for an amplifying grant). On `ExecRights =
Unit` both collapse to `True`; here the second is FALSE. -/

/-- **`attenuate_confers_real` (NON-VACUOUS).** Attenuating a held cap and re-labelling
the Spec image yields a `confers`-child of the held cap's Spec image — over the GENUINE
`ExecCapRights` lattice. The rights conjunct is `confRights (attenuate keep c) ≤ confRights c`
(`Exec.attenuate_confRights_le`), a real `⊆`, NOT `() ≤ ()`. This is the rights non-amplification
of delegation, stated where it can fail. -/

/-- **`confers_real_forbids_amplification` (the TOOTH).** If a child Spec cap (over the
genuine lattice) `confers`-descends from a parent, then its rights are `⊆` the parent's: it
CANNOT carry an authority the parent lacks. Contrapositive of "amplification allowed". On `Unit`
this is vacuous (`() ≤ ()`); here it constrains — see `amplifying_grant_refused`. -/

    {parent child : Cap Label ExecCapRights} (h : confers parent child) :
    child.rights ≤ parent.rights :=
  h.2

/-- **`amplifying_grant_refused` (the NON-VACUITY TOOTH).** A child cap requesting
`{read, write}` does NOT `confers`-descend from a parent holding only `{read}`: the amplifying
grant is REJECTED. This is the exact case `ExecRights := Unit` could never reject (there, every
same-target child confers). The `decide` discharges the real `⊄` over `Finset Auth`. -/
theorem amplifying_grant_refused :
    ¬ confers (⟨7, {Authority.Auth.read}⟩ : Cap Label ExecCapRights)

  -- `{read,write} ≤ {read}` is FALSE over the genuine ⊆-lattice.
  exact absurd hle (by decide)

/-- **`strict_attenuation_witness` (the STRICT-ATTENUATION TOOTH).** A held cap confers
`{read, write}`; the granted child confers only `{read}` — the held cap has a right (`write`) the
granted does NOT, and the grant `confers` SOUNDLY (strict `⊂`). Exhibits that `≤` is not
everywhere-trivial: it admits the sound narrowing AND (by `amplifying_grant_refused`) rejects the
amplification. Strictness: `{read} ⊆ {read,write}` but `{read} ≠ {read,write}`. -/
theorem strict_attenuation_witness :
    confers (⟨7, {Authority.Auth.read, Authority.Auth.write}⟩ : Cap Label ExecCapRights)

#guard decide (({Authority.Auth.read} : ExecCapRights)
                  ≤ {Authority.Auth.read, Authority.Auth.write}) = true   -- attenuation SOUND

/-- **`execGraph caps`** — the `Spec.Authority.Graph` reconstructed from the executable cap
table: cell `h` holds a Spec edge to `t` iff, in `Exec.caps`, `h` holds a `node t` cap or an
`endpoint t` cap carrying `write` (the two branches `authorizedB` accepts). The rights are
`Unit` (the connectivity skeleton). -/
def execGraph (caps : Caps) : Graph Label ExecRights :=
  fun h c =>
    -- the `.any` reads `c.target`, so the edge depends on the cap `c`.
    (caps h).any (fun cap =>
      (cap == Authority.Cap.node c.target) ||
      (match cap with
       | .endpoint t rights => (t == c.target) && rights.contains Auth.write
       | _ => false)) = true

/-! ### §2.AUTH-CONNECTS — the INDEPENDENT authority-connectivity spec.

`execGraph` is DEF-EQ to the executor's `.any confersEdgeTo` lookup gate (`execGraph_eq_any := rfl`),
so a guarantee leg that uses a bare `execGraph caps h c` as a CONNECTIVITY claim attests it
tautologically — the spec IS the gate. `authConnectsCap` / `authConnects` is the SEVERED reference:
the SAME per-cap authority predicate the 55 passing `Circuit/Spec/*` guards use (`confersEdgeTo`'s
two branches: a `node t` cap, or an `endpoint t` cap carrying `write`), but phrased as an EXISTENTIAL
over LIST MEMBERSHIP (`∃ cap ∈ caps h, …`) — `Graph.has`-shaped, the Granovetter "you can reach what
you hold a cap to" relation. This is NOT `isDefEq` to the boolean `.any … = true` fold (the gate): the
gate is a `Bool`-coercion `(List.any …) = true`; `authConnects` is a `Prop`-level `∃ … ∧ …` over
`List.Mem`. They are PROPOSITIONALLY equivalent (`List.any_eq_true`) but not definitionally — so
`isDefEq` separates them, and the refinement `gate ⟹ authConnects` is a REAL proof (it must run
`List.any_eq_true`), not `rfl`. The relation reads only the pure carriers `caps`/`confersEdgeTo`-shape
— no executor STEP gate — so it is independent.

Alignment with the `Metatheory` authority law: `authConnects` is the executable-image of
`Graph.has` (Granovetter connectivity), the SAME object `AuthorizedProduction`/`noforge_closure`
(`Metatheory/Open/AuthorityClosure.lean`) constrains: an edge exists only where a held cap PRODUCES
it; no edge is forged. -/

/-- **`authConnectsCap t cap`** — does `cap` confer an authority edge to target `t`? The SAME two
branches `confersEdgeTo`/`authorizedB`/`execGraph` read (a `node t` cap, or an `endpoint t` cap
carrying `write`), written as a `Prop` (not the `Bool` the gate folds). The per-cap atom of the
independent connectivity spec. -/

/-- **`authConnects caps h c`** — the INDEPENDENT authority-connectivity relation: holder `h` holds
SOME cap in its slot conferring an authority edge to `c.target`. An EXISTENTIAL over list membership
(`Graph.has`-shaped), NOT the executor's boolean `.any … = true` lookup gate — so it is not defeq to
that gate, yet is provably IMPLEMENTED by it (`capLookup_refines_authConnects`). The severed
reference the C-c1 authority-graph legs attest against. -/

is NEITHER everywhere-true NOR everywhere-false. It ACCEPTS a holder that holds a `node 7` cap

relation could not carry the refuted half; a vacuous reject-all could not carry the accepted half. -/

/-- **`exec_owns_self_confers` (NOW OVER THE GENUINE RIGHTS LATTICE)** — the authority
object the ownership branch lands on is the **reflexive self-conferral**, stated over the REAL
`ExecCapRights = Finset Auth` lattice (NOT the `Unit` skeleton). When a turn is admitted via
ownership (`turn.actor = turn.src`), the owner's self-cap (carrying its ACTUAL conferred rights
`r : ExecCapRights`) confers itself: the rights conjunct is `r ≤ r` over the genuine `⊆`-order —
the SAME order that REJECTS an amplifying grant (`amplifying_grant_refused`). The ownership
hypothesis `hown` is load-bearing — it collapses the two endpoints to one.

SCOPE: reflexivity is intrinsically `r ≤ r`, but it now lives in the non-trivial lattice, so it
composes (via `confers_trans`) with the genuine narrowing `attenuate_confers_real` to bound a
delegated grant — and the order it uses is the one with teeth (§2.3), not `() ≤ ()`. -/

`attenuate_confers_real` (the real `⊆` narrowing) via `confers_trans`: the attenuated grant
`confers`-descends from the owner's self-cap, and its rights are `⊆` the owner's. An amplifying
grant is OUTSIDE this relation (`confers_real_forbids_amplification` + `amplifying_grant_refused`).

/-! ## §3 — The simulation relation + the commuting square.

`Refines k a` ties the executable `KernelState` `k` to an abstract Spec state `a` — the
balances correspond (the ℤ ledger IS the `balance`-domain total) and the caps correspond (the
executable cap table reconstructs the abstract authority `Graph`). The abstract state is the
pair (the conserved balance-domain total over the live accounts, the reconstructed authority
graph) — the two Spec projections the squares above prove. -/

caps confer). These are exactly the two projections squares §1 and §2 prove. -/

/-! ## §3.5 — The second refinement square: the content-addressed record kernel `⊑ Spec`.

§1–§3 refine the toy scalar kernel (`Exec.Kernel`, `bal : CellId → ℤ`). Here we prove the
same square for the content-addressed `Value` record cell (`Exec.RecordKernel`, `cell : CellId
→ Value`), which conserves a named `balance` field rather than the whole-state ℤ. The record
kernel's `balance`-field conservation IS `Spec.conservedInDomain Domain.balance` at `Bal = ℤ`
— the same abstract law as §1, now refined by the concrete record cell. -/

/-- **`refineRecordConservation s s'`** — the per-cell `balance`-FIELD deltas of a record-kernel step

/-! ## §4 — OPEN: the operational residue (the abstract small-step relation).

What §3 PROVES is the conservation+authority PROJECTION of the simulation square: the two Spec
laws (`Σδ = 0` over the `balance` domain, the authority `Guard`/`Graph` gate) are preserved by
`exec`, with the abstraction `absOf` as the refinement witness. What it does NOT prove — and
what the FULL l4v-style `Exec ⊑ Spec` forward simulation needs — is an *abstract small-step
relation* `AbsStep : AbstractState → AbstractState → Prop` (the spec's own operational
transition), such that:

  * every executable `exec k turn = some k'` is matched by an `AbsStep (absOf k) (absOf k')`
    (the FULL square's bottom edge is an abstract STEP, not merely the identity-on-projections
    we use here); and
  * `AbsStep` is exactly the `Spec.Conservation` + `Spec.Authority` dynamics — a turn that
    moves balance-domain ℤ conservatively AND fires an authorized `Spec.Authority.AuthStep` /
    `GenAct`/`RestrictAct` on the graph.

This is the SAME residue already flagged by `Proof/Refine` (the operational diagram) and by
`Spec.Authority.only_connectivity_begets_connectivity`'s OPEN (the whole-history graph
bookkeeping). It needs the abstract LTS, not just the two static projections; until that LTS
is named, the bottom edge of the square is the projection-preserving abstraction, not a full
abstract transition. The residual obligation:

-- OPEN (operational residue, NOT proved here): define `AbsStep : AbstractState → AbstractState
--   → Prop` as the `Spec.Conservation`-conservative, `Spec.Authority`-authorized abstract turn
--   relation, and prove `exec k turn = some k' → AbsStep (absOf k) (absOf k')` (forward
--   simulation: every executable step is an abstract step). With that, `exec_step_refines`
--   strengthens from "preserves the two projections" to "commutes with a genuine abstract
--   step" — full `Exec ⊑ Spec` forward simulation. The projections proved above are the
--   conserved/authority CONTENT of that step; the missing piece is the LTS that packages them
--   as one transition relation (the same thread `Spec.Authority`'s headline leaves OPEN).
