# Dregg2.Consistency — the global consistency witness (non-vacuity + non-contradiction).

The dregg2 metatheory conditions its keystones on Prop-carrying typeclasses (`World`,
`BFTModel`/`Pacemaker`, `GraphPrivacyKernel`/`BlindedMembershipKernel`, `Hyperedge`/`JointBinding`,
`CryptoKernel`, `HolderAnonymity`, …). If those carriers were jointly unsatisfiable the whole
edifice would be vacuous; if their conjunction derived `False` it would be contradictory.

This module proves a concrete, axiom-clean consistency witness: every system-level Prop-carrier
is inhabited by a discriminating model — one that rejects dishonest inputs (each carries a
tooth `example`). `dregg_consistent` packages the joint inhabitation as a single record; cluster
lemmas check co-instantiation of interacting carriers.

OPEN: faithfulness to the real Rust system is a separate grounding axis, not proved here.
The crypto-standard carriers (`collisionHard`, `binding`, `extractable`, …) cannot be proved in
Lean — they are isolated in §4 and are NOT the non-vacuity evidence.

/-! ## §1 — A discriminating `HolderAnonymity` witness.

The prior `HolderAnonymity` witness had `view ≡ 0`, `ViewIndistinguishable ≡ fun _ _ => True` —
an all-True collapse making `blindedset_hides_holder` vacuous. We replace it with a concrete,
discriminating witness (over `Digest := Int`):

  * `compress := BlindedSet.Reference.refCompress` (`= (·+·)`), so `MemberOf` is
    inhabited via `ref_member_at`;
  * `view _ root := root.toNat` — depends only on the issuer root, not which member. Different
    roots give different views (the tooth ruling out `fun _ _ => 0`);
  * `ViewIndistinguishable := Eq` — concrete equality, not the `True`-collapsible carrier.

`hides_law` closes by `rfl` (two members of the same root have the same root-indexed view). -/

/-- **The discriminating holder-anonymity witness.**
`view _ root := root.toNat` collapses which member while separating issuer roots;
`ViewIndistinguishable := Eq` is the concrete view-equality conclusion (not `True`-collapsible).
A `def`, not a global `instance`, following the `Privacy.graphRef`/`memRefNat` idiom: witnesses
the interface is inhabitable by a non-trivial model without silently satisfying a `[HolderAnonymity]`
obligation. (`@[reducible]` only silences the class-typed-`def` lint.) -/
@[reducible] def discriminatingAnon : HolderAnonymity Int where
  compress := BlindedSet.Reference.refCompress
  view _ root := root.toNat
  ViewIndistinguishable := Eq
  hides_law _ _ _ _ _ := rfl

/-- Tooth 1 — the hiding law is genuine: two authorized members of the same issuer root produce
equal views. Routed through `blindedset_hides_holder` at the discriminating witness. -/
example (root m m' : Int)
    (h : MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress root m)
    (h' : MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress root m') :
    discriminatingAnon.ViewIndistinguishable
      (discriminatingAnon.view m root) (discriminatingAnon.view m' root) :=
  @blindedset_hides_holder Int discriminatingAnon root m m' h h'

/-- Tooth 2 — the view is non-constant: roots `3` and `5` give different views, so
`view ≢ fun _ _ => c` and `ViewIndistinguishable` is the honest `Eq`, not a `True`-collapse. -/
example (m m' : Int) :
    discriminatingAnon.view m 3 ≠ discriminatingAnon.view m' 5 := by
  show (3 : Int).toNat ≠ (5 : Int).toNat
  decide

/-- Tooth 3 — real members exist: `compress := refCompress` makes `MemberOf` inhabited
(`ref_member_at`). Here `1` and `2` are authorized members of root `3`. -/
example : MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress 3 1 ∧ MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress 3 2 := by
  refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
  · have := BlindedSet.Reference.ref_member_at (x := 1) (s := 2); simpa using this
  · have := BlindedSet.Reference.ref_member_at (x := 2) (s := 1); simpa using this

/-- Tooth 4 — the full non-vacuous statement: members `1` and `2` of root `3` are authorized
and have indistinguishable views at the discriminating witness. -/
example :
    discriminatingAnon.ViewIndistinguishable
      (discriminatingAnon.view 1 3) (discriminatingAnon.view 2 3) := by
  have h1 : MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress 3 1 := by
    have := BlindedSet.Reference.ref_member_at (x := 1) (s := 2); simpa using this
  have h2 : MemberOf discriminatingAnon.compress 3 2 := by

/-! ## §2 — Reused system-level witnesses, re-exhibited with teeth.

The remaining system-level carriers have non-trivial axiom-clean witnesses in their home modules.
We re-expose each as a named handle and re-check a discrimination tooth that distinguishes the
witness from the trivial model. -/

/-! ### §2.1 — Privacy: `graphRef` (stealth/nullifier) + `memRefNat` (blinded membership). -/

/-- Handle: the non-trivial graph-privacy witness (`addrView a := a.oneTimeKey % 2`, non-constant). -/
abbrev graphPrivacyWitness : GraphPrivacyKernel := Privacy.Reference.graphRef
/-- Handle: the non-trivial blinded-membership witness (`memberOf e _ := e < 2`, genuine predicate). -/
abbrev blindedMembershipWitness : BlindedMembershipKernel Nat := Privacy.Reference.memRefNat

/-- Tooth — `graphRef`'s `addrView` is non-constant: addresses for two recipients differ. -/
example : @GraphPrivacyKernel.addrView graphPrivacyWitness ⟨0⟩
    ≠ @GraphPrivacyKernel.addrView graphPrivacyWitness ⟨1⟩ := by
  show (0 : Nat) % 2 ≠ 1 % 2; decide

/-- Tooth — `memRefNat`'s membership predicate is genuine, not `fun _ => True`: `2` is no member. -/
example (sc : SetCommitment Nat) :
    ¬ @BlindedMembershipKernel.memberOf Nat _ blindedMembershipWitness 2 sc := by
  show ¬ (2 < 2); decide

/-! ### §2.2 — Network/consensus: `World.Reference` ⊗ `BFT.Inhabited.model` ⊗
`BFTLiveness.Inhabited.pacemaker`, all over `Msg = Vote`. -/

/-- Handle: the reference `World` (`recv r := fixedVotes.take r`, real append-only schedule). -/
abbrev worldWitness : World World.Reference.M := inferInstance
/-- Handle: the BFT model at the minimal `n=4,f=1` floor (three honest voters, empty adversary). -/
abbrev bftWitness : BFT.BFTModel BFT.Inhabited.cfg BFT.Inhabited.votes := BFT.Inhabited.model
/-- Handle: the reference pacemaker over `World.Reference` (GST=3, honest leader every view). -/
abbrev pacemakerWitness :
    BFTLiveness.Pacemaker World.Reference.M BFTLiveness.Inhabited.votesOf BFTLiveness.Inhabited.cfg :=
  BFTLiveness.Inhabited.pacemaker

/-- Tooth — the reference world's schedule delivers a quorum (computes `true`). -/
example : quorumReached ((World.recv (Msg := World.Reference.M) 3)) ⟨3, 0, 3⟩ 7 = true := by decide

/-- Tooth — `bft_agreement` applies to the BFT witness: two `n−f`-quorum blocks must coincide. -/
example (b₁ b₂ : Nat)
    (hq1 : BFT.Inhabited.cfg.n - BFT.Inhabited.cfg.f ≤ (votersFor BFT.Inhabited.votes b₁).length)
    (hq2 : BFT.Inhabited.cfg.n - BFT.Inhabited.cfg.f ≤ (votersFor BFT.Inhabited.votes b₂).length) :
    b₁ = b₂ :=
  BFT.bft_agreement BFT.Inhabited.cfg BFT.Inhabited.votes bftWitness b₁ b₂ hq1 hq2

/-- Tooth — liveness is derived for the pacemaker witness: the quorum follows from delivery. -/
example : ∃ (block r : Nat), BFTLiveness.Inhabited.cfg.threshold ≤
    ((((BFTLiveness.Inhabited.votesOf (World.recv (Msg := World.Reference.M) r)).filter
      (fun v => v.block = block)).map (·.voter)).dedup).length :=
  BFTLiveness.gst_liveness_of_pacemaker
    BFTLiveness.Inhabited.votesOf BFTLiveness.Inhabited.cfg pacemakerWitness

/-! ### §2.3 — DAG-BFT ratification: `SuperRatification`, DERIVED from the real lace. -/

/-- Handle: the `SuperRatification` whose votes/quorum are CONSTRUCTED from the real `ratLace`
(`SuperRatification.ofLace`), not hypothesized structure data. -/
noncomputable abbrev superRatificationWitness :
    CordialMiners.SuperRatification CordialMiners.Inhabited.state CordialMiners.Inhabited.cfg
      CordialMiners.Inhabited.rg1 :=
  CordialMiners.Inhabited.superRatifyG1

/-- Tooth — the ratifying quorum is met on the lace (`≥ n−f = 3` ratifiers), not
assumed: `rg1` is committed. -/
example : CordialMiners.Committed CordialMiners.Inhabited.state CordialMiners.Inhabited.cfg
    CordialMiners.Inhabited.rg1 :=
  CordialMiners.Inhabited.g1_committed

/-! ### §2.4 — Cross-cell binding: `Hyperedge` (apex) + `JointBinding` (binary) are PROPER. -/

/-- Handle: a real `N`-cycle hyperedge over ℤ with Σ-zero half-edges (here `N = 3`, `δ = id`). -/
noncomputable abbrev hyperedgeWitness :=
  Hyperedge.ringHyperedge 3 (fun i => (i : ℤ))

/-- Tooth — the hyperedge binding is a proper subobject: some product config is not
`HyperAdmissible` (CG-5 `1 ≠ 0`), so the binding carries genuine content. -/
example : ∃ (T : Boundary.TurnCoalg Unit Unit)
    (turnId : Unit → JointTurn.TurnIdOf (TurnId := Unit) T)
    (halfEdge : Unit → JointTurn.HalfEdgeOf (Bal := Nat) T)
    (xs : Unit → T.Carrier) (t : Unit),
    ¬ Hyperedge.HyperAdmissible Unit T turnId halfEdge xs t :=
  Hyperedge.hyper_binding_is_proper

/-- Tooth — the binary `JointBinding` is likewise a proper subobject: some product config is
excluded by CG-5 `1 + 1 ≠ 0`. The cross-cell binding is more than per-cell × per-cell. -/
example : ∃ (T₁ T₂ : Boundary.TurnCoalg Unit Unit)
    (turnId₁ : JointTurn.TurnIdOf (TurnId := Unit) T₁) (turnId₂ : JointTurn.TurnIdOf (TurnId := Unit) T₂)
    (half₁ : JointTurn.HalfEdgeOf (Bal := Nat) T₁) (half₂ : JointTurn.HalfEdgeOf (Bal := Nat) T₂)
    (x₁ : T₁.Carrier) (x₂ : T₂.Carrier) (t : Unit),
    ¬ JointTurn.JointAdmissible T₁ T₂ turnId₁ turnId₂ half₁ half₂ x₁ x₂ t :=
  JointTurn.binding_is_proper

/-! ### §2.5 — Cross-vat oracle: `CryptoKernel.Reference` is a DISCRIMINATING verify seam. -/

/-- Handle: the reference cross-vat crypto kernel (`verify stmt proof := decide (stmt = proof)`,
a discriminating echo-verifier — it REJECTS non-matching proofs). -/
abbrev cryptoKernelWitness : CryptoKernel Crypto.Reference.D Crypto.Reference.P := inferInstance

/-- Tooth — the reference `verify` accepts a matching proof... -/
example : CryptoKernel.verify (Digest := Crypto.Reference.D) (Proof := Crypto.Reference.P) 7 7 = true := by
  decide
/-- ...and rejects a non-matching one (not Verify-always-true). -/
example : CryptoKernel.verify (Digest := Crypto.Reference.D) (Proof := Crypto.Reference.P) 7 8 = false := by
  decide

/-! ### §2.6 — Cross-vat functoriality: `phi_functorial_concrete` (the model citizen). -/

/-- Handle: the discriminating verifier-functor witness, reused under this module's
`concreteVerifiable` (definitionally equal to VatBoundary's). -/
abbrev phiFunctorialWitness :
    Spec.PhiFunctorial (CellId := Bool) (Rights := Unit) Unit Unit Bool
      (Spec.Phi (Request := Unit) (Statement := Unit) (fun _ => ())) :=
  Spec.phi_functorial_concrete

/-! ## §3 — The capstone: joint non-trivial inhabitation.

The system-level carriers do not all share a single type parameter (privacy over `StealthAddr`/`Nat`,
consensus over `Vote`, cross-cell over `TurnCoalg`, cross-vat over `Int`/`Bool`), so a single
joint `instance` is a type-parameter clash. We therefore package the joint inhabitation as one
inhabited record bundling all discriminating witnesses simultaneously, plus cluster-consistency
lemmas where carriers interact over a shared type. The bundle being inhabited means
all carriers coexist in one Lean context without deriving `False`: the system is neither vacuous
nor contradictory at the system level. -/

/-- `SystemModel` — a record bundling all system-level carriers' discriminating witnesses.
Its inhabitation (`dregg_consistent`) is the joint-consistency statement. The cross-cell
`Hyperedge`/`JointBinding` carriers are parametric proper-subobject facts rather than typeclasses;
their non-triviality is `hyper_binding_is_proper`/`binding_is_proper`, exhibited as teeth in §2.4. -/

/-! ## §4 — Crypto-standard carriers (necessarily Lean-trivial — isolated, not counted).

These `Prop` carriers cover cryptographic hardness (DLog, collision-resistance, STARK/FRI soundness,
foreign-chain finality). They cannot be proved in Lean; a `True` discharge in the reference
instance is correct and expected, and is NOT the non-vacuity evidence. They are isolated here
so they remain visibly separate from the system-level witnesses above; conditioned theorems
consume them as explicit hypotheses, never silently.

Representative reference discharges (all `= True`, all honest):
  `CryptoKernel.collisionHard`, `CryptoPrimitives.{collisionHard,binding,unlinkable}`,
  `{Pedersen,Merkle,Dfa,…}VerifierKernel.extractable`, `MacKernel.unforgeable`,
  `DischargeCrypto.cryptoSound` (discharged `False` — advertises toy-unsoundness),
  `UCBridge.FComDischarge.{correct,perfectHiding,bindingReducesToDLog}` (CryptHOL-proof data). -/

/-- Isolated crypto-standard boundary: the reference `CryptoKernel`'s `collisionHard` is `True` —
the honest Lean discharge of a hardness assumption (Poseidon2 CR). Not non-vacuity evidence;
necessarily trivial, isolated here to keep it visibly separate. -/
