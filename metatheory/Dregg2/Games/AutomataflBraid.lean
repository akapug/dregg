# AutomataflBraid — all-Lean sealed reveal → resolution → automaton → winner.

This file is the game-level braid over the three Lean-authored semantic legs:

* Leg S (`AutomataflRevealRefine`) opens two sealed moves;
* Leg R refines `old → resolveMid old moves`;
* Leg A refines `mid → automatonStep mid`;
* the pure game reads `winner` from the resulting board.

The functional braid below is n-generic at the pure-game layer. The existing emitted
Leg-R/Leg-A capstones prove these exact stage relations at their currently closed
instantiation (`NN = 2`); fixed-n11 Leg S cannot honestly be attached to that circuit
pair yet. `ProofNativeDeploymentJoin` names the equality carriers an n11 proof-native
caller would need, while `CurrentLiveDeployment` additionally names the live host
encoding and n=5 shape. `no_current_live_deployment` proves the latter cannot be
inhabited today. Nothing here registers a descriptor or treats those residuals as
closed.

The collision theorem is unconditional: a substituted opening with the same published
commitment and different reveal data yields an explicit arity-4 collision. The stronger
no-collision statement remains conditional and is not used by the game braid.
