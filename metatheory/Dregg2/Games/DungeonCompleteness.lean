# Dregg2.Games.DungeonCompleteness — uniform capability and completeness laws.

This file closes two named seams between the native Lean model (`Dungeon`) and its
Lean-authored `Exec.RecordProgram` model (`DungeonProgram`):

* the key-exhibition inversion is uniform over every deployed keyed way (2, 3, 4),
  rather than a theorem specialized to way 2;
* the exact boundary of honest model-to-program completeness is formalized: the
  coarse `Inv` is insufficient, while every actually replay-reachable state
  preserves the stronger per-relic provenance relation the program requires.

Honest scope: every theorem here is about the name-keyed, signed-`Int`
`Exec.RecordProgram` model.  It does not claim refinement to the deployed unsigned
evaluator; `DungeonProgram.lean` records that separate substrate seam.
