# Salvage Lock — a seeded paired-glyph hatch

Six sealed plates carry exactly two copies of each of three glyphs.  One plate may
remain exposed between actions; the second exposure either clears a matching pair or
closes both.  The type therefore makes an impossible "three exposed plates" state
unrepresentable.  All shared-world effects go through `judge` and Core's receipt.

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget; Rust and TypeScript dispatch the finite table this
board generates, they do not carry a second copy of the rules.

## The board is the seed

The board used to be `glyphAt seed slot = (slot + seed) % 3` over a three-element
seed space.  Every seed produced the SAME pairing `[[0,3],[1,4],[2,5]]` — the seed
only renamed the glyphs — so `pair = slot mod 3` cleared the hatch on every seed
without remembering anything and without reading the instance.  The seed space was
nominally 3 and effectively 1.

The board is now drawn from the run seed by four CONSUMING draws
(`SeedDraw.drawBelow?`): the partner of plate 0 (5 ways), the partner of the lowest
remaining plate (3 ways), and which of the three glyph names labels each resulting
pair (3! ways).  5 * 3 * 3! = 90, which is exactly the number of six-plate rows
carrying two copies of each of three glyphs, and the induced pairing ranges over all
15 perfect matchings of six plates.  Both facts are proved below against
INDEPENDENTLY ENUMERATED domains — every one of the 6^6 candidate partner functions
and every one of the 3^6 candidate glyph rows — so the construction cannot satisfy
them by agreeing with itself.

## The board is no longer in the wire

The paragraph that used to stand here said the emitted table still published the
board twice — in each action row's `glyph_id`, and in the successors, which say
which exposures clear — and that hiding it needed "a different wire (a commitment
to the board plus per-exposure openings)".  That wire is built.

`Emit` now renders `FiniteTables.salvageParametricTransitions`: a first exposure
is deterministic, and a second names BOTH successors, `on_match` and
`on_mismatch`.  One bit per second exposure comes from the judge, which holds the
live run seed; `FiniteTables.salvage_parametric_table_is_the_kernel` is the
refinement over all ninety boards.  `MissionSpec.runSeed` itself is now derived
per run from a committed slot secret (`HiddenInstance.runSeedFor`), so nothing a
client fetches determines the board.

This kernel did not change.  `Config.seed_eq` still binds the played board to
`mission.runSeed`; what changed is that the seed is no longer published.

## ⛑ The budget: 18, and it was 12 because nobody solved the hidden game

`MAX_TURNS` was 12 from before the board left the wire, and it stayed 12 after.  That
is the whole defect: 12 was sized against a game in which the plates showed their
glyphs, and the game that shipped hands the player ONE BIT per comparison — did these
two match — and no glyph at all.

Exhaustively solved (uniform over the 15 perfect matchings; a comparison is two
exposures; the player learns only match/mismatch and remembers everything):

| exposures | comparisons | perfect play | memoryless | skill band |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
|  6 |  3 |   1/15 =  6.67% |  6.67% |  0.00 pts |
|  8 |  4 |   3/15 = 20.00% | 16.44% |  3.56 pts |
| 10 |  5 |   6/15 = 40.00% | 27.23% | 12.77 pts |
| **12** |  6 |   **9/15 = 60.00%** | 37.83% | 22.17 pts |
| 14 |  7 |  12/15 = 80.00% | 47.63% | 32.37 pts |
| 16 |  8 |  14/15 = 93.33% | 56.35% | 36.98 pts |
| **18** |  9 |  **15/15 = 100.0%** | **63.91%** | **36.09 pts** |
| 20 | 10 |          100.0% | 70.35% | 29.65 pts |

⚑ **At 12 a player who plays perfectly loses two runs in five.**  Not through a
mistake — the budget sat exactly at the mean of optimal play, so the game punished
correct play and had no way to say so.

**Why 18:**

1. **It is the exact adversarial worst case of the game that actually ships.**  An
   adversary answering any way still consistent with some board forces nine
   comparisons and no more.  So the budget is spent to its LAST EXPOSURE in the worst
   case and is never one short of it: tight, and never cheating.
2. **Correct play is never punished.**  15 of 15.  That was the whole complaint —
   "a player who plays perfectly and loses is right to feel cheated" — and only 18
   answers it.
3. **The skill band costs almost nothing to get there.**  36.09 points against the
   36.98 maximum at 16: 0.89 points, for the property that a perfect player never
   loses.  ⚠ 16 is the band's argmax and it is the WRONG number, because the band
   is a tiebreaker and not the criterion — `scripts/poa-design-gate.py` FAILS a budget
   that refuses more than one perfect run in twenty (`budget-refuses-optimal-play`,
   threshold 95%) and 16 sits at 93.3%, BELOW the repo's own bar.  A first draft of
   this section argued for 16 by quoting the band maximum and not the bar it failed.

**Why an EVEN number.**  A comparison is two exposures and nothing else buys
information, so an odd budget spends its last exposure on a plate whose pair can never
be turned — `a_lone_last_exposure_clears_nothing` is that, proved.  17 and 19 are 16
and 18 with a dead button on the end.

⚠ **The skill band above is a MEASUREMENT, not a theorem in this file.**  It is an
exhaustive backward induction over the belief state (sets of candidate matchings),
which memoizes to nothing in a scripting language and does not fit a Lean structural
recursion without an explicitly tabulated state enumeration — that table is undone
work and is named here rather than dressed up.  The perfect-play column IS
independently checked: `poa-design-gate.py`'s `skill-band-is-real` recomputes it from
the EMITTED rows and agrees (84/90 at 16 — and that agreement is what moved this
number, because the same pass FAILED 16).

⚠ **And one gate measure here is computed on the WRONG GAME.**
`hidden_pairing_worst_case` partitions candidate boards by WHICH previously-seen plate
an exposure matches, which hands the player a glyph identity the emitted rows never
give.  That is the pre-split face-up game; it returns 10 exposures where the one-bit
game's real worst case is 18, and it is why `hidden-board-floor` reports slack on a
budget that is exactly tight.  The gate flags the contradiction itself inside
`budget-refuses-optimal-play`; fixing it belongs to whoever owns the gate.

What this file pins is the SHAPE of the budget — `the_budget_is_nine_comparisons`
and `a_lone_last_exposure_clears_nothing`.

/-! ⚠ `PINNED_RUN_SEED` is GONE.  It spelled `SALVAGE-1`, it was published in the
descriptor and the catalog, and it therefore named the board to anyone who read
either.  A precommitted constant stops a host grinding the seed after a
transcript; it does not stop a player computing the answer before the run, which
is the property a hidden board needs.  The live seed is now
`HiddenInstance.runSeedFor`, drawn per (slot, mission, player) from a slot secret
the descriptor commits to and does not contain.

### What the seed space actually is

Checked against independently enumerated domains rather than against `pairsOf` /
`boardRow` restated: `allMatchings` filters all 6^6 candidate partner functions by
"fixed-point-free involution", which is what a perfect matching of six plates IS,
and `allBoards` filters all 3^6 candidate glyph rows by "two of each glyph". -/

/-! ⚑ **THE SEED-SPACE ENUMERATIONS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This
module is in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and the four
`native_decide` pins below enumerate 6^6 partner rows, 3^6 glyph rows and all 90 seeds at
elaboration, so any change to the seed space was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in
the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). The pins'
STATEMENTS stay here as evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions (a `def` body elaborates
without running), beside the domains they compare. The EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`,
pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `SalvageLockFixtures.lean`, rooted in
the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a degenerate
seed space reds the guard library instead of the archive.

Named residue: NONE — nothing here demands a proof as data, so all four pins moved. -/
