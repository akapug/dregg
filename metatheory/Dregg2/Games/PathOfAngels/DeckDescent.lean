# Deck Descent — go down for the find, and pay to come back up

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget.  Rust and the browser only dispatch the table the
Lean emitter writes.

## Why this module exists beside `DeckExpedition`

`DeckExpedition` owns *custody*: officers, injuries, a daily counter, per-object
salvage records, a persistent `State` carrying `Finset ExpeditionKey`.  It is a
content kernel and it is the right shape for one — but its state is not finitely
enumerable (the fixture alone spans ~10^7 configurations) and its `RawConfig`
carries a fully authored `ValidatedPack`, so nothing about a run is drawn from
the run seed.  A machine with no hidden bit and no finite table cannot be a POAG1
descriptor and cannot be scored by `scripts/poa-design-gate.py`.

This module is the *playable* descent: the same fiction — go in, take a thing,
carry it out — reduced to a machine whose whole reachable state space is emitted,
whose instance is a per-run hidden draw, and whose every design property below is
a theorem over the transition this file exports.

## The shaft forks

⚑ 2026-08-05, second pass.  The first shaft was a straight line, so "route
commitment" was only *paying twice* — there was no option a descent could close
behind it.  There is now a junction: the mouth chamber has two children, and a
body that commits to one spur pays two units of air to be standing at the other.
`sweepLine` is the transcript that visits both, and it costs the entire budget.

⚑ 2026-08-06, third pass.  The junction existed but its branches were MIRROR
IMAGES: same depth, same parent, same one relic, crossing table invariant under
the swap — so cautious-east was cautious-west relabelled and the branch only
became a decision AFTER a bit was revealed.  `scripts/poa-design-gate.py`
measured the candidate repairs over its own reconstruction: pricing a spur
higher (extra air to enter, with or without an extra relic behind the toll)
turns the 18/18 junction split into 26/0 — a labelled corridor nobody takes —
while a SECOND RELIC on the east spur at the SAME distance breaks the mirror and
keeps the branch: all eight draws become distinct games, outcome-changing forks
rise 1145 → 1360, the junction splits 18/19, and the clock still binds at nine.
So the east spur holds two relics, the asymmetry is in the PRIZE and never the
PRICE (`asymmetry_is_prize_not_price`), and `Sling`/`ChamberState` count relics
per chamber instead of flagging them.

## ⚑ 2026-08-09, fourth pass — the game had no decision, and here is why

The playtest found a NINE-ACTION SCRIPT that banked fifteen fresh boards in a row
buying no information: shore, descend, shore-east, descend-east, lift, lift,
climb, climb, exit.  Two exact fits made it, and both are now gone.

  * **`SHORING = 2` exactly covered a spur route's two passages.**  A body could
    timber the mouth AND a spur it had never looked at, so no bit ever needed
    reading.  Supply is ONE now (`supply_does_not_cover_the_route`): every
    descent leaves a passage open and must choose which.
  * **`AIR = 9` was exactly that route's length.**  It still is nine — but the
    route it now pays for is the SCOUTED one, seven crossings and lifts plus the
    timber plus THE LOOK.  The look is inside the budget instead of outside it.

The instance changed with them.  With one timber and both spurs able to flood,
the all-flooded draw is a mission no play banks — an unwinnable instance, which
is a design-gate FAIL and a run a player loses having done everything right.  So
the spurs share a bulkhead: at most one takes water (`the_spurs_share_a_bulkhead`),
the family is SIX draws instead of eight, and a dry spur always exists.  Finding
it is the game.

MEASURED, over this kernel, before and after:

  | | best blind script | optimal play | look strictly optimal |
  |-|-|-|-|
  | before (8 draws, 2 timber) | **8/8** — and seven distinct scripts did it | 8/8 | never |
  | after (6 draws, 1 timber) | **4/6** (`check_no_blind_line_banks_every_board`) | 6/6 | yes |

Both edits are load-bearing and neither works alone: six draws with two timbers
leaves a blind script at 6/6, and eight draws with one timber drops OPTIMAL play
to 6/8 — a player who plays perfectly and loses, which is the thing this repair
is not allowed to produce.

## The four properties this design is accountable for

1. **Two incomparable budgets.**  `AIR` is the clock and `SHORING` is the supply.
   No action converts one into the other, and `check_budgets_are_incomparable`
   exhibits two accepted lines that trade them in opposite directions.
2. **Information is purchasable — and now worth purchasing.**  A chamber's passage
   is hidden until `survey` spends a unit of air on it, or until a body walks into
   it.  `shore` may still be spent blind, but there is only one timber, so the
   fork is real: air to learn WHERE to spend it, against supply spent on a guess.
3. **Route commitment.**  Every chamber entered must be crossed again on the way
   out, and an unshored flood damages on both crossings; and beyond the mouth the
   shaft *branches*, so choosing a spur puts the other one two units of air away.
4. **Extraction is the point.**  A relic in the sling is worth nothing; a relic
   through the hatch is the find.  Damage lowers carrying capacity, and a
   crossing that overruns it leaves the deepest relic on the deck.

## What the budget is sized for

`AIR = 9` is the SCOUTED line and nothing else: timber the mouth, enter it, take
its relic, sound a spur, descend the dry one, lift, climb, climb, exit.  Nine.
The blind lines are EIGHT and lose anyway — a run that refuses to look does not
run out of air, it runs out of knowing, and the spare unit buys nothing.

looked at, and the look was never worth its air.  `supply_does_not_cover_the_route`

one door: at most one spur takes it, and `the_spurs_share_a_bulkhead` is that
fact over the whole table.  The mouth is the main shaft and floods on its own.

This is not decoration and it is not a shrunken instance space for its own sake.
With one timber (`SHORING`) and both spurs able to flood, the all-flooded draw is
a mission no play can bank — an unwinnable instance, which is a design-gate FAIL

Three CONSUMING draws off one stream (`SeedDraw.drawBelow?`), so the three bits
are independent reads and not one byte wearing three hats — the wound

/-- ⚠ Honest note, CHANGED 2026-08-09.  The spur draw is below THREE, and 256 is
not a multiple of three, so `SeedDraw.ceilingFor 3 = 255` and the byte 255 IS
rejected.  The `getD` fallback below is therefore no longer dead code: it is
reached when every remaining seed byte is 255.  The docblock this replaces said
the fallback was unreachable — true of three below-two draws, false of this
derivation — and it is corrected rather than carried forward.
`draw_below_the_reading_never_rejects` still covers the MOUTH draw.

⚑ **CHANGED AGAIN, the same day: the mouth is a READING of the ship's bilge.**
The main shaft is not an independent coin — it is the same water Vent Crawl's
crawlers meet at the bottom of their shaft, and a descent reads it badly.  A wet
bilge floods the mouth on THREE of the reading's four faces; a dry one, on ONE.
`DayWater` carries the calibration (the mouth is still a fair coin to anyone who
has not been in the vents) and the measurement that picked 3/4 rather than an
exact bit — an exact bit takes this game's best BLIND fixed line from 0.6667 to
0.8333, past the design gate's own 0.75 bar, because six boards and one spare
unit of air have no slack to give away.

that fails closed against the mission's own acceptance predicate, and a `judge`
that binds the transcript into the receipt. -/

/-! ## The design properties, measured over the actual transition

Everything below is over `stepB` and `replayB` — the same functions the emitter
tabulates and the judge runs.  There is no second model of the descent anywhere
in this repository.

The `native_decide` proofs of the measured design properties live in
`DeckDescentFixtures.lean`, rooted in `PathOfAngelsGuards`, so a plain `lake build`
still checks them. Moving those proofs on 2026-08-08 separated their elaboration
from the FFI archive's build, but did not defer the closed `check_* : Bool`
computations retained here: native module initialization eagerly evaluates them.

The exhaustive blind-script search and its check moved with their exact bodies
into `DeckDescentFixtures.lean` on 2026-09-18. The other closed measurements below
remain runtime initialization work. Their functions and general/kernel-checked
theorems are unchanged. No construction here consumes a `native_decide` proof as
data. -/

playtest found `deepEastLine` and won fifteen fresh boards in a row buying no
information — because two timbers exactly covered a route's two passages and
nine air was exactly that route's length.  Both fits are gone: the supply covers
ONE passage (`supply_does_not_cover_the_route`) and the nine air now buys the
route AND the look.  `check_no_blind_line_banks_every_board` is the playtest's
own experiment, run exhaustively inside the kernel. -/

other row names one.  `constBoard` supplies a fixed reading, and
`step_is_one_of_the_two_branches` is the fact that makes the two-successor row

`branches_agree_on_refusal` plus `step_is_one_of_the_two_branches`, but the
proof kept foundering on reducing `rowFor`'s two-scrutinee match under a
hypothesis.  It is a tactic problem, not a mathematical one, and it wants
`rowFor` refactored to branch on `Option.isSome` first.  The gate's differential
independently rebuilds every refusal from the emitted view, so the property is
checked there in the meantime — but it is checked, not proved, and this comment
exists so the next reader does not assume otherwise. -/

`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._:-]{0,95}$` before it will read a row, so a descriptor whose
