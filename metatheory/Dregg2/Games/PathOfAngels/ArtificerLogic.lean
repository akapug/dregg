# Artificer Logic — name the rule, not the instance

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget.  Rust and the browser only dispatch the table the
Lean emitter writes.

## The verb is different

Every Path of Angels game shipped so far is an INSTANCE-GUESSER: Signal hunts a
code, Salvage hunts a pairing, Deck Descent hunts three passage bits.  The player
is told the rule and asked for the hidden value.

Here the value is not hidden — every charge the mechanism will ever be fed is
public, and so is what it does with each one.  What is hidden is the RULE.  You
feed the mechanism a train of cogs, it turns or it jams, and you win by NAMING
the law it obeys.  That is Zendo/Eleusis, and it is a genuinely different verb.

## Zendo's failure, and the fix this codebase already owns

Classic Zendo loses players because the rule space is unbounded: a guess feels
arbitrary and a loss feels unfair.  The fix is the discipline this repository
lives by anyway — the manual is an INDUCTIVE TYPE.  `Rule` below has seven
families and sixteen inhabitants, all of them rendered into the descriptor, so a
player narrows a KNOWN lattice.  Twenty questions over a visible space is fair;
twenty questions over an unstated one is not.

⚑ TOY SIZE, DELIBERATELY.  Three cogs, two metals, eight charges, sixteen rules.
The grammar is small so that every property below is a theorem over the ACTUAL
transition rather than a sample of it, and so that the whole reachable state
space is emitted.  `docs`-level sizing and the families to add first are in the
lane report; the shape of this file does not change when the manual grows.

## The four properties this design is accountable for

1. **The manual has no synonyms.**  `manual_has_no_synonyms` — two rules that
   agree on all eight charges ARE the same rule.  This is the design gate for an
   induction game: an indistinguishable pair means a player can play perfectly
   and still lose to a coin flip.  It is stated as a ∀ over `Rule`, not as a
   check over a list, and `the_cut_family_would_have_been_a_synonym` exhibits the
   family this grammar was cut back from to keep it true.
2. **The budget binds exactly.**  `certainWithin` is a minimax over the remaining
   charges.  `four_charges_are_enough` and `three_charges_are_not` are the two
   halves of "worst-case identification = 4 = `PROBE_BUDGET`, slack ZERO".
3. **Which charge, not whether.**  A charge that cannot split the surviving
   candidates is REFUSED — the mechanism has already answered it.  So every
   accepted probe is a real cut, and `every_open_probe_resolves` says every one
   of them consults the instance.  The decision the game asks for is *which*.
4. **Certainty is not a gamble, and a gamble is not certainty.**  With one
   candidate left, declaring it is an `advance` row — one successor, no oracle
   consulted (`certain_declaration_is_an_advance`).  With two left it is a
   `resolve` row and the run can end either way.  The table says which, in the
   bytes, before the player commits.

## What the budget is sized for

`PROBE_BUDGET = 4` is not slack.  Sixteen rules over eight binary charges is a
perfect four-bit code — `three_charges_are_not` — so four cuts identify and three
never can.  MEASURED: of the eight opening charges only three keep a run on a
four-cut line, and `bbb` is the trap, an even 8/8 split that still costs five.
An even split is not the same as a good one, and that is the whole lesson of the
opening.

/-! ### ⚠ The property is refutable, and here is what it cost

`Threshold` has no `three`.  It had one while this grammar was being drawn, and
the family collided with `uniform` — the check above would have been FALSE.  The
cut family is modelled here by its signature so that the collision is a theorem
and not a design note, and so a later hand that adds `three` back finds this. -/

def atLeastThreeSignature (m : Metal) : List Bool :=

⚑ The whole state is the SURVIVING CANDIDATE SET plus the clock.  There is no
separate record of which charges have been fed, and there does not need to be: a
charge already fed can no longer split the survivors (they were filtered by its
answer), and a charge that cannot split is REFUSED.  `a_fed_charge_never_splits_
again` is that fact, and it is why the state space is the lattice of candidate
sets rather than the far larger space of evidence transcripts. -/

/-! ## The design properties, measured over the actual transition

⚑ **THE MEASUREMENTS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made
every game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the
compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). Each measured design
property — here and in the rendering/shape sections below — stays as an evaluation-free
`check_* : Bool` definition over `stepR`/`certainWithin`/`rowFor`, the same functions the
emitter tabulates and the judge runs (a `def` body elaborates without running). The
EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives
in `ArtificerLogicFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain
`lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard library instead of
the archive.

Named residue: NONE. No construction in this module consumes a `native_decide` proof as
data, so every pin moved. -/

/-- ⚑ Can this candidate set still be cut down to ONE, within `fuel` charges, on
the WORST answer the mechanism could give?  A minimax: both branches of every cut
must succeed, so a `true` here is a guarantee and not a hope. -/

/-! ### The opening, measured

The single most useful thing a player can be taught about this game is that an
EVEN CUT IS NOT THE SAME AS A GOOD ONE.  Here is that, as a theorem. -/

/-! ## The parametric table — the rules without the instance

A descriptor cannot carry the hidden rule.  What it carries instead is a table in
which every row that CONSULTS the instance names BOTH of its successors, and
every other row names one.  `stepWith` is the transition under a fixed answer —
it is `stepR` itself with the oracle replaced by a constant, not a copy of it. -/

    stepR hidden s a = stepWith (oracleAnswer hidden a) s a := rfl

/-- ⚑ **The row is complete.**  For every hidden rule, every state and every
action, the real transition equals one of the two branches the emitted row names.
A client that renders both branches has rendered every outcome that can occur,
and the descriptor has still not said which.

Where `DeckDescent` needed a nine-way case split for this, one suffices here: the
instance reaches the transition through `oracleAnswer` and nowhere else, and
`oracleAnswer` is a `Bool`. -/

  s.candidates.all (fun r => oracleAnswer r a == b)

/-- ⚑ A forced answer is the TRUE answer.  If every survivor says `b`, then the
hidden rule says `b` — because the hidden rule is a survivor (`truth_survives`).
This is what makes a one-successor row honest rather than a guess. -/

/-- The five reasons this kernel can give.  ⚑ Every one of them is reachable —
`every_declared_reason_is_reachable` — because a refusal a client can render and
the kernel can never produce is a lie in the UI.

⚠ `solved` and `run-lost` are SEPARATE, and the split is not cosmetic.  A run
that ended is not a run that was won, and this game is the one on the rack where
those come apart: a mistaken naming stops the machine exactly as a right one
does.  A single `run-over` covering both would tell a player who guessed wrong
the same thing it tells a player who was right.  (`solved` is also the name the
shared browser engine requires on a terminal state's rows, so the split is the
contract as well as the honest reading.) -/

/-- ⚑ **An `advance` row IS the real step**, for every instance the evidence still
permits.  A client that follows the single successor of a one-branch row has not
guessed: the row is one-branch exactly when every surviving candidate agrees, and
the hidden rule is a surviving candidate.

⚠ `DeckDescent` names this direction and does NOT land it — its
`rowFor` compares two successors, and the proof foundered on reducing a
two-scrutinee match under a hypothesis.  Deriving the row from `allAnswerB`
instead of from an equality between branches is what makes it go through. -/

/-! ### The board-independent closure

Both branches of every resolve row are followed, so the closure is the set of
knowledge states reachable under SOME instance — exactly the state set a
descriptor that names both branches has to declare.

⚑ LAYERED BY THE CLOCK.  `step_spends_exactly_one` says every accepted action
advances `spent`, so a state reachable in `n` actions has `spent = n` and two
layers can never overlap.  Enumerating layer by layer means each level is only
ever deduplicated against itself — the difference between an `eraseDups` over
~57,000 entries and one over a few hundred. -/

pinned to the precommitted run seed by a proof obligation, a `terminalOutput`
that fails closed against the mission's own acceptance predicate, and a `judge`
that binds the transcript into the receipt. -/
