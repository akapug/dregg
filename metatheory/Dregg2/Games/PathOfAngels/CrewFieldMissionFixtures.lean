# Crew field mission — the hostility-lab EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`CrewFieldMission.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build root),
and until 2026-08-08 its laboratory ran sixty-three `native_decide` pins at elaboration — the
largest single population in the game cone — so any game-fixture regression was a hard failure
of every Rust proving target in the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture
outage measured). The lab's STATEMENTS remain in `CrewFieldMission.lean`, beside the private
fixture world (`fixtureConfig`, `drive`, `completionFor?`, `katConfig`, the KAT envelopes) they
must see; THIS module is where they are RUN. It is rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library
and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged. Two statement shapes arrive here, both evaluation-free in
the parent: pins whose statement was ALREADY a named public `Bool` definition are pinned under
that definition; the rest are pinned through the `check_<theorem_name> : Bool` definition the
parent now carries.

⚠ Five construction proofs did NOT move — `fixturePolicy.catalogue_bounded`,
`wrongArtifactPolicy.catalogue_bounded`, `fixture_config_valid`, `fixture_rekeyed_config_valid`
and `kat_config_valid`. `ActivityOutcome.Policy` carries its bound as a field and `Config`
carries `rawConfigValidB … = true` as a field, so those proofs must elaborate where the
fixture, rekeyed and KAT worlds are BUILT. They are the named residue; the lab header in
`CrewFieldMission.lean` records it. `fixture_run_seal_carries_the_fixture_session` also stays
there — it is `rfl`, and its `#assert_compiled` census line reflects the residue its statement
reaches through.

These definitions were compiled into the `Dregg2.FFI` closure, and Lean computes every compiled
no-argument `def` when its module initializes: each `check_*` and fixture here ran on every node

/-- The production surface refuses a caller who is not the seat: the wrong
keypair's envelope is a GENUINE ML-DSA-65 seat signature (it verifies under its
own key) and it still opens nothing, because `authenticateSeat?` runs the same
`SHAKE256(pk) = playerKey` pin.  Control in the same statement: seat 0's own
envelope does open it.
(Pinned `= true` in `CrewFieldMissionFixtures`, under the theorem name
`kat_step_surface_refuses_a_genuine_signature_under_the_wrong_key`.) -/
