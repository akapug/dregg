# Shipworks — recurring maintenance as a finite PoA game

Shipworks is the ordinary work of keeping an inhabited pocket of the Khovokhi
comfortable.  It is one coherent, short game with four scheduled jobs rather
than four reskinned score buttons:

* power reroute rewards output while its switching faults pulse on even turns;
* atmosphere scrub starts dirtier and rewards deliberate fault removal;
* coolant repair has the sharpest late-session pressure curve;
* ration synthesis needs the largest output and makes reserve use consequential.

The player chooses two distinct single-use tools, then spends a bounded sequence
of scans, advances, stabilizations, improvisations and tool uses before asking
the station to certify the result.  Every ordinary turn advances the mission's
authored pressure schedule.  Certification is possible only after the station
has been scanned, the job target has been reached, and faults are within the
job-specific limit.

Daily recurrence is not a streak.  A finalized mission epoch selects both the
job and its pressure variant.  Browser UTC is retained only as unauthoritative
telemetry and is proved irrelevant to settlement.  Missing any number of epochs
does not change a later reward.  Persistent state remembers only the last
claimed mission epoch and the canonical u64 player counter, so one epoch cannot
be claimed twice and counter exhaustion refuses.

Most importantly, a submission contains actions, not a reward.  Settlement
replays those actions in Lean and derives the exact `Contribution` here.  There
is no caller-authored reward field and no clipping or saturation path.

/-! ⚑ **THE FIXTURES NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).**  This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made
every game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the
compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured).  Every strategy/hostile
fixture below is now an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition (a `def` body
elaborates without running); the EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `ShipworksFixtures.lean`, rooted in the
`PathOfAngelsGuards` library.  A plain `lake build` still runs every pin; `lake build
Dregg2.FFI` never does.  This module keeps NO `native_decide` residue: every fixture value
below is constructed with kernel-checked (`decide`/`norm_num`) proofs only. -/
