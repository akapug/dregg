# Black Box Reconstruction — recover the recorder's channel order by probing it

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget; Rust and TypeScript only dispatch the tables the
Lean emitter writes, they do not carry a second copy of the rules.

## ⚠ What this file used to be, and why it was not a game

The previous kernel asked the player to place five fragments in one order and
compared the finished sequence against `orderFromSeed`.  Three facts about it,
each measurable from the file itself:

* `orderForOffset` read ONE byte mod 5 and returned a cyclic rotation, so the
  instance space was **5 of the 120 permutations** — the seed picked a rotation,
  never a permutation.
* `MAX_TURNS = FRAGMENT_COUNT = 5` and every action placed one fragment, so a run
  was **exactly one attempt**.
* Nothing in `step` returned any observation.  The player learned **nothing**
  during a run.

Five instances, one attempt, zero feedback: a 1-in-5 coin flip with a permutation
proof attached.  The theorems below it were all true and none of them was about a
decision.  The information floor was undefined (an instance cannot be identified
with one answer class) and the execution floor was one lucky guess.

## What it is now

The recorder has five sequence positions and five recovered fragments.  A hidden
permutation says which fragment belongs at which position.  One action —
`probe slot fragment` — asks the recorder a single question:

    where does the fragment at this position sit relative to this one?

and the recorder answers **earlier**, **placed**, or **later**.  A `placed`
settles that position, and both the position and the fragment leave play.  An
`earlier`/`later` costs the turn, eliminates that pair, AND names the side of it
the true fragment is on.  A run wins when every position is settled, and loses by
running out of probes.

## ⚑ Why the answer grew a third class (2026-08-09)

The previous kernel answered `match`/`mismatch` and set `MAX_TURNS = 15`.  Both
numbers were wrong in the same way, and the playtest found it: **any systematic
scan won 100% of runs.**

The measurement behind that.  With a two-class answer the game is exactly the
problem of finding a hidden perfect matching in `K(5,5)` by asking about cells,
against an adversary who answers `mismatch` whenever a matching avoiding the cell
survives.  Forcing the first cell needs four eliminations (Hall: a deficiency in
`K(5,5)` needs five missing edges, and the target cell is one of them), and every
one of those four sits in the row or column that then LEAVES with the settled
position — so nothing carries over and the five positions cost 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
**The exact minimax was 15, and the left-to-right scan attains it.**  The budget
was therefore the worst case of the DUMBEST sensible strategy and of the best one
at the same time, which is what "nothing to think about" means arithmetically:
no budget could separate them, because there was nothing to separate.

So the ANSWER changed rather than the budget.  With `earlier`/`later` a probe
that misses still halves the candidates on one side, and the exact minimax —
searched adversarially over every strategy — is **11**.  `MAX_TURNS = 11` is that
number: a player who uses what the recorder tells them never loses, and the
left-to-right scan that ignores it now banks **91 of 120** draws.

The trade the third class creates is the one the budget is for: probing the
MIDDLE of the surviving range learns the most and is least likely to settle
anything; probing the end you believe in settles fastest and learns least when it
misses.  Breadth against certainty, priced at one turn either way.

byte wearing four hats — the wound `SeedDraw` was written to close. -/

/-! ## The budget is exactly the worst case OF OPTIMAL PLAY

`MAX_TURNS` is a design claim and it has two halves.

The ACHIEVABILITY half is pinned here over every one of the 120 instances: the
reference policy that USES the recorder's answer — `bisectActions`, which probes
the middle of the range the answers have left standing — wins on all of them and
never spends more than eleven probes, and ATTAINS eleven, so the budget is not
slack.

The matching lower bound — that no policy does better than eleven in the worst
case — is a statement about all strategies, not about this one.  It was searched
exactly (adversarial minimax over the belief lattice, every strategy, every
answer): the player cannot guarantee a win in ten and can in eleven.  That search
is the design gate's job to reproduce from the emitted oracle, and it is recorded
here as a measurement rather than as a theorem of this file.

⚑ And the FOIL is kept, because the repair is only visible against it.
`scanActions` is the left-to-right sweep this game shipped with — the policy that
ignores `earlier`/`later` and just tries fragments in order.  It won 120/120 at
the old budget.  It wins 91 of 120 now, and `check_the_hint_ignoring_scan_no_longer_wins`
is that number.  A player who does not use what they are told loses about one run
in four. -/

/-! ### The reference policy that listens

`bisectAux` probes the MIDDLE of the fragments the answers have left standing for
this position, and recurses into the side the recorder names.  It is a policy, not
a rule: it reads `orderAt` directly because it is the reference player, and every
action it produces is replayed through `step` like any other. -/

/-- A transcript that is accepted at every step, spends the whole budget, and is
NOT rewarded.  Eleven probes that never name a correct pair: the run is legal
throughout and loses. -/
def losingTranscript : List Action :=
  (allSlots.flatMap fun slot =>
    allFragments.filterMap fun fragment =>
      if fragment == orderAt 0 slot then none else some (Action.probe slot fragment)).take MAX_TURNS

/-! ## Refusal reachability, witnessed

⚑ **A declared refusal reason that cannot fire is decoration.**  The design gate
measures that from a total transition table for every other Path-of-Angels game;
this one has no such table (the state space is a subset lattice, `2^25`), so the
gate reported the vocabulary as UNCHECKED — `black-box-reconstruction/refusals-\
declared-not-checked`, a gap in the instrument rather than a property of the game.

The gap closes by EMITTING the evidence.  Each witness is a legal transcript
prefix and one further probe; the kernel replays it and reports the reason, the
descriptor carries the witness, and `scripts/poa-design-gate.py` replays the same
witness against the emitted ORACLE TABLE and re-derives the reason from the
declared `settles` semantics without reading any of these definitions.  Two
sources for one fact, which is the only shape that catches a disagreement.

⚠ The witnesses are the shortest transcripts that reach each guard, on the
identity instance (order 0), EXCEPT `turnLimit`, which needs the budget spent:
`losingTranscript` is the fifteen legal non-matching probes `a_run_can_be_lost`
already replays. -/
