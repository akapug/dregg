# StationCrateOpenRuntime — the WRITE boundary for the station's daily ritual

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics behind a canonical byte
wire.  Nothing here is an AIR, a constraint system or a gadget.  Rust carries
bytes to this module and back; it computes nothing.

`StationDailyRuntime` is the station's READ and says of itself that the write
path is "unreachable by type".  That was true when it was written and it is not
true now: `SalvageCrate.CurrentStateCapability` is a sealed structure with a
`private` constructor and two producers — `genesis` (the one-time install) and
the successor an ACCEPTED open hands back — so `openCrate` is reachable through
a genesis-rooted chain of accepted transitions.  `StationCrateOpen` composes
that chain with `ShipInstrumentPanel.observe` and proves both poles on real
crate output.  What was still missing was transport: no `@[export]`, so no
player could reach it.  **This module is that transport.**

## What the caller authors: identity and intent, and nothing else

The request carries a crew key and the node's durable open log.  It carries no
seed, no beacon, no date, no ticket index, no entry, no contribution, no
counter, no sequence number and no state.  Every one of those is DERIVED here:

* the **period** is `rolled.state.currentPeriod` — read off the crate state the
  replay produced, never off the wire.  A caller cannot ask for a different day.
* the **sequence** is the log's length, and the **player counter** is the number
  of times that crew key already appears in the log.  Both are positions in the
  log, so a caller who edits either edits the log itself — and the log then
  fails to replay (`history-refused`).
* the **entry**, its **contribution** and the moved gauges come from the crate's
  own accepted `OpenResult` and the panel's own `observe`.  This module chooses
  no number that any reader sees.

## ⚑ The node's log IS the replay authority, and that is a real assumption

`SalvageCrate`'s append-only `consumed` set is what refuses a second open of one
period, and this module reconstructs that set by replaying the log from
`genesis`.  So the replay guard is exactly as strong as the log:
`the_replay_guard_is_exactly_as_strong_as_the_node_log` states both halves as one
theorem — the same crew key, the same period, ACCEPTED when the log is empty and
REFUSED when the log contains the prior open.  A node that loses, truncates or
declines to append to its log re-opens the crate.  That is not a defect this
module can close from inside; it is the property the storage side must carry,
and it is written down here rather than left to be discovered.

## ⚠ The current period is the INSTALLED period, because nothing advances it

`SalvageCrate.advancePeriod` exists and is capability-gated, but no finality
adapter calls it, so `genesis`-rooted replay leaves `currentPeriod` at
`genesisPeriod` — the first authored beacon — forever.  This transport therefore
opens the installed day and only the installed day.  It is deliberately NOT
patched by letting the request name a period: that would hand the caller the one
value the crate uses to key replay.  The finality leg is named work, not a
caveat: until it lands, one crew key opens the crate exactly once.

A log row still carries its period, because the replay needs it to rebuild the
envelope the crate accepted, and because a row that names any other period must
be refused rather than silently re-dated
(`a_log_row_from_another_period_refuses`).

## The panel is the station's ONE panel

`ShipInstrumentPanel.observe` is called on `StationCrateOpen.panel`, which is the
same object `StationDailyRuntime.stationPanel` now abbreviates.  There is one
panel deployment, not two that agree today.

## The wire

Request (`POA-CRATE-OPEN-1`), key order pinned by `Request.toJson`:

    {"format":"POA-CRATE-OPEN-1","opener":"<64 lowercase hex>",
     "history":[{"player":"<64 lowercase hex>","period":n},…]}

Reply (`POA-CRATE-OPEN-OUT-1`):

    {"format":"POA-CRATE-OPEN-OUT-1",
     "federation_id":"<hex>","content_session":"<hex>","content_epoch":n,
     "opener":"<hex>","period":null|n,
     "opened":true,"refusal":null,
     "entry":{"id":n,"prize":"…","supplies":n},
     "panel":{"gauges":[{"gauge":n,"meter":"supplies","exact_total":n,
                         "full_at":n,"shown":n,"at_full":false}],
              "recovered_kinds":n,"observed":n,"admitted":n}}

    {"format":"POA-CRATE-OPEN-OUT-1", … ,
     "opened":false,"refusal":"already-opened-this-period",
     "entry":null,"panel":null}

A refused document carries **no gauge and no entry**
(`a_refused_open_publishes_no_gauge_and_no_entry`), so a reader can never mistake
a refusal for a move that happened to add zero.

Acceptance is `NetworkJudgeWire.canonicalDecode` — the same seal
`decodeSignalInput`, `dregg_poa_signal_slot_derive` and the station READ use,
imported rather than re-typed.  An unknown field, a missing field, a transposed
key, an uppercase hex digit, a trailing byte or a re-spelled integer all fail the
re-encode comparison and the export returns `""`.

The gauge and entry projections are `StationDailyRuntime`'s own
(`gaugeWireOf` / `entryWireOf` / `meterLabel` / `prizeLabel`), imported rather
than re-typed, so the ship a writer sees and the ship a reader sees are spelled
by one function.

## Cost

Replay is a fold over the log: one `openCrate` and one `observe` per row, and the
player counter is a count over the prefix, so the whole request is quadratic in
the log length.  `MAX_HISTORY_ROWS` is the panel's own `MAX_OBSERVED` (4096) —
beyond it `ShipInstrumentPanel.observe` refuses anyway, so this bound removes no
reachable behaviour.

The envelope builder is `StationCrateOpen.envFor` — the SAME one the two proved

rather than a re-typed lookalike.

Everything here is parameterized by `(config, deployment)` deliberately: the
document laws below are properties of the CEREMONY, not of the station's
particular content, so they hold for every deployment and can carry the strong
`#assert_axioms` pin instead of inheriting this content's compiled
`configValidB`/`panelValidB` evaluation. -/

/-! ### ⭐ THE LOOP, CLOSED

The write publishes a moved ship and the node appends one row.  The station READ
is handed that row and must serve the SAME ship.  Until 2026-08-07 it could not:
`POA-STATION-DAILY-1` had no field for the log, so over HTTP the write served
`exact_total: 1, observed: 2` while `/api/poa/station/…/panel` served
`exact_total: 0, observed: 0`.

The log below is `(secondOpen crew41).history` — not a third spelling of the row,
but the very log the replay pole above is refused against, so this theorem and
that one cannot drift. -/

/-! ### Hostile wires, each refused -/

/-! ## The pins, split honestly

Everything about the SEAL and the DOCUMENT SHAPE is kernel-clean and gets the
strong pin.  Everything about the STATION's particular authored content inherits
that content's `configValidB` / `panelValidB` compiled evaluation — which is a
compiled-evaluator fact and is labelled as one.

⚑ **THE FIXTURE PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).**  This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build; `dregg_poa_crate_open` is exported
from it — and a `native_decide` here made every game-fixture regression a hard failure of
every Rust proving target.  Every fixture theorem above is now an evaluation-free
`check_* : Bool` definition; the EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `StationCrateOpenRuntimeFixtures.lean`,
rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library.  A plain `lake build` still runs every pin;
`lake build Dregg2.FFI` never does.  This module keeps NO `native_decide` residue: its
deployment is `StationCrateOpen`'s `crate`/`panel`, cited by name, and the general
seal/document laws stay kernel-clean below. -/
