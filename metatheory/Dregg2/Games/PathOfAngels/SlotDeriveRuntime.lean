# SlotDeriveRuntime — the ONE per-run instance derivation the node may call

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics behind a canonical byte wire.
Nothing here is an AIR, a constraint system or a gadget.  Rust carries bytes to this
module and back; it computes nothing.

## Why an export exists at all

`Judged.admissionChecks` requires two facts the node cannot assert, only SUPPLY:

* `active.slotCommitment = HiddenInstance.commit active.slotSecret active.slot`
* `active.runSeed = HiddenInstance.runSeedFor ⟨secret, slot, playerKey⟩ ctx`

and `SignalTriangulation.Config.target_eq` requires a third,
`some target = targetFromSeed? mission.runSeed`.  The judge RE-DERIVES all three and
refuses on mismatch.  That is a CHECK only if the node derived them independently: a node that
shipped `Emit.UNBOUND_RUN_SEED` and let the judge fill it in would be asking the judge
to compute the answer rather than to verify that the node served the committed one.

So the node must derive — and `HiddenInstance.commit`/`runSeedFor` are a
Poseidon2-BabyBear-w16 sponge with its own padding, lane-aliasing rejection
(`laneByte?`), domain tags (`POAC`/`POAD`) and squeeze count.  A Rust copy of that
would be an unproven twin of a SOUNDNESS function, where a one-byte disagreement
either refuses every scored run or, worse, agrees on an instance the player was never
served.  Hence exactly one `@[export]`, and no Rust arithmetic.

## What is proved about it, and with which pin

⚠ `HiddenInstance.commit`, `runSeedFor` and `practiceRunSeed` are `@[irreducible]`,
because `Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm` reduces EXPONENTIALLY under whnf (measured
2026-08-05: 47.6 GB resident and 68 minutes of CPU for one file that tried).  The
export path runs COMPILED code and is unaffected, but it splits the theorems below in
two, and the split is the honest one:

* Anything general — the canonical seal, the three projections of `derive`, and the
  admission weld — never mentions a concrete digest, so both sides of every equation
  are the SAME opaque application and nothing has to reduce.  Those are `rfl`/`simp`
  and pinned with `#assert_axioms`.
* Anything about a CONCRETE request must actually run the sponge.  Those are
  `native_decide` and pinned with `#assert_compiled`: they are trusted to the compiled
  evaluator, which is exactly the evaluator the export itself runs on, and saying
  otherwise would be a label rather than a proof.

## The wire

Request (`POA-SLOT-DERIVE-1`), key order pinned by `Request.toJson`:

    {"format":"POA-SLOT-DERIVE-1","slot":<u64>,"secret":"<64 lowercase hex>",
     "mission_id":<u64>,"epoch":<u64>,"federation_id":"<64 lowercase hex>",
     "content_session":"<64 lowercase hex>","player_key":"<64 lowercase hex>"}

Reply (`POA-SLOT-DERIVE-OUT-1`):

    {"format":"POA-SLOT-DERIVE-OUT-1","commitment":"<64 lowercase hex>",
     "run_seed":"<64 lowercase hex>","target":{"low":n,"mid":n,"high":n}}

`mission_id`, `epoch`, `federation_id` and `content_session` are exactly
`HiddenInstance.MissionContext` — the projection that deliberately EXCLUDES `runSeed`,
which is why the derivation is visibly not a cycle
(`HiddenInstance.context_ignores_the_run_seed`).

⚠ The SECRET crosses this wire.  It is node-held state, never a client claim, and these
bytes must not leave the node.  The reply deliberately does NOT echo it.

Acceptance is `NetworkJudgeWire.canonicalDecode` — the SAME seal `decodeSignalInput`
uses, imported rather than re-typed, so acceptance here and acceptance there cannot
drift: parse, then require the Lean encoder to reproduce the candidate bytes exactly.
An unknown field, a missing field, a transposed key, an uppercase digit, a trailing
byte or a re-spelled integer all fail that comparison and the export returns `""`.

⚑ **`none` WHEN THE SEED DRAWS NOTHING.**  `SignalTriangulation.targetFromSeed?` is
partial by necessity (216 ∤ 2^256), and this export does not paper over that: a seed
whose byte stream is exhausted before three bands are drawn yields no reply at all.
The alternative — returning a substitute target — would hand the judge an instance
the seed did not draw, and `Config.target_eq` would then be unprovable for exactly
the runs where it matters most.  The refusal reaches the node as the `""` sentinel
the export already had.

⚠ Written with `Option.map` rather than a `match`.  A `match` on this scrutinee
generates equation lemmas indexed by the scrutinee's constructors, and `unfold`ing
through them makes the KERNEL whnf `targetFromSeed? (runSeedOf request)` — a
Poseidon2 sponge — which overflows its stack (`deep recursion detected`, measured
while writing this).  `@[irreducible]` on the sponge does not help: it is an
elaborator hint and the kernel ignores it.  `Option.map` has one equation and the
inversion below never reduces the seed. -/

/-! ## Concrete requests, and why these are compiled pins

Each fixture below names a real digest, so `decide`-style reduction would have to run
the Poseidon2 permutation in the kernel, which does not terminate at any useful size.
The pins are `native_decide` and pinned with `#assert_compiled`.  What they buy is that
the general statements above are not vacuous over an empty accepted set: the wire really
does decode, the derivation really does run, and the refusals really are reachable.

⚑ **THE PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and the thirteen `native_decide`
pins below ran at elaboration, so a stale derivation fixture was a hard failure of every
Rust proving target in the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture
outage measured). The pins' STATEMENTS stay here, each as an evaluation-free
`check_* : Bool` definition (a `def` body elaborates without running).  The EVALUATION —
each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in
`SlotDeriveRuntimeFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain
`lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard library instead of
the archive.
