# EventSourcing — generic, replay-first PoA aggregate semantics

The canonical object is an ordered event stream.  Projections and snapshots are
derived caches.  The payload is generic: Signal runs, expeditions, archives,
attendants, and editorial aggregates may share this sequencing kernel without
sharing their event vocabulary.

This module proves structural replay laws.  It does not claim cryptographic
security for the supplied digest boundary, durable storage, or atomic database
CAS.  A deployment must instantiate `DigestBoundary` faithfully and atomically
compare/persist the returned cursor.

/-- ⚑ THE REDUCER IS THE SEMANTICS.  An accepted event's successor projection is
EXACTLY the supplied reducer's answer on the predecessor projection.

Without this law every theorem proved about a `Reducer` is a theorem about a
function the emitted bytes need not have called: `applyEvent` could publish any
projection at all and every `reduce_*` lemma downstream would stay green.  A wire
codec that exports a judge needs this to carry its reducer facts to its output —
see `GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntime.judge_command_projection_is_reduce`.

Refutation to watch: give `applyEvent` a successor it did not get from `reduce`
(e.g. `projection := bonus projection`) and this goes red immediately. -/

/-! ## Executable adversarial teeth

⚑ **THE TEETH NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made every
game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target. The teeth's STATEMENTS
stay here, each as an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition (a `def` body elaborates
without running); the EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` +
`#assert_compiled` — lives in `EventSourcingFixtures.lean`, rooted in the
`PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture
reds the guard library instead of the archive.

The hostile checks pin the EXACT refusal error, which is strictly stronger than the old
`fail_if_success`-guarded "not accepted" harness — an equality with `.error e` refutes
acceptance by construction. Named residue: none; every evaluation moved. -/
