# RecordsRuntime — the Lean-authored read model behind the PoA Records surface

A player who finishes a Path of Angels run needs somewhere for that run to
*land*.  `FinalizedRunEventAggregate` already says what landing means: one
finalized turn, re-judged from its exact stored bytes, projected into Canon, the
Field Archive, a personal locker, an Attendant notice and an Editorial inbox
item.  Nothing exported that projection, so no reader could see it, and any host
that wanted to would have had to rebuild it in Rust.  This module is that
export.

The boundary is deliberately shaped so the host contributes **no semantics**:

* the host supplies the exact persisted config and Canon bytes of the retained
  genesis head, and, for every durable transition, its finalized coordinate plus
  the exact stored judge input/output bytes;
* Lean re-decodes both genesis blobs under `NetworkJudgeWire`'s canonical seal,
  re-runs the native Signal judge over every row through
  `FinalizedRunEventAggregate.checkPayload?`, and folds the one shared `reduce`,
  so the Canon chain is rebuilt here rather than trusted from storage;
* every published field is a projection of that fold.

Three properties of the surface are worth stating plainly.

**It shows the world before it shows any run.**  With zero rows the view is not
an empty list: it is the exact world identity, world meters, Canon revision and
playable mission a run would write into, decoded from the bytes the genesis
ceremony actually installed.  A node at height 0 has something true to display.

**It never publishes the answer, and the previous spelling of this paragraph was
wrong.**  It used to say that omitting `SignalConfigWire.target` was enough.  It
is not, and the fixture in this very file proved it: `ViewWire.mission` was a
full `MissionWire`, `MissionWire` carries `runSeed`, and
`SignalTriangulation.targetFromSeed?` is a public function — a rejection-sampled
draw from a published seed to the code.  A surface that omits `target` and
publishes `runSeed` has published the target.

Two things close it, and the second exists because the first is one edit away
from being undone:

* the published mission is `PublicMissionWire`, which has **no** `runSeed` field.
  `publicMission_ignores_the_run_seed` says that substituting *any* seed leaves
  the published value unchanged, so this is a theorem about the projection and
  not a promise about a filter;
* `project?` additionally **refuses** a config whose seed is not
  `Emit.UNBOUND_RUN_SEED`.  A retained genesis config is a mission TEMPLATE and
  carries the all-zero sentinel; a live seed appearing there means something
  upstream is wrong, and this read refuses rather than rendering it.

**It publishes nothing derived from the transcript, in any form.**
`RunWire.transcriptDigest` is gone.  `SignalTriangulation.transcriptDigest` is
**not a digest** — it is a fixed-width plaintext encoding, byte 0 the action
count and bytes 1..15 the submitted bands, so for a solved run its tail *is* the
target.  ⚠ And hashing it would be theatre, not a fix: an accepted transcript is
at most five guesses from 216, a space of about `2^39`, which brute-force
inverts on a laptop.  There is no safe encoding of a run's guesses on a public
route, so there is no such field.  What a player did is theirs; what they *won*
is the record.

**Coordinates come from the checked payload, not from a re-decoded carrier.**
`CheckedPayload` already proves the finalized `actorRoot`/`signer` equal the
settlement carrier fields, so the published values are both at once
(`runWireOf_coordinate_agrees_with_the_settlement_carrier`).  The host must
still supply those two from the finalized `SignedTurn` and durable receipt; when
it does, a substitution refuses here exactly as
`FinalizedRunEventAggregate.hostile_finalized_signer_substitution_refused`
requires.

Named deployment boundaries, unchanged by this module: that the coordinates came
from the real generic `CommitRecord`, the durable CAS, and collision resistance
of the persistence digests.  `MAX_ROWS` is a hard fuse, not pagination — a world
with more finalized runs than that refuses here and needs a windowed request
before it can be read again.  Each accepted row costs two native judge
invocations (`checkPayload?` for the record, `reduce` for the fold).

  `HiddenInstance.practice_is_not_judged` is the refutation, because the purpose
  tag is inside the sponge preimage.
* `submitted` — a claim the node accepted for evaluation.  No verdict exists.
* `judged` — native Lean accepted it, and that is still not finality;
  `poa_signal_adapter` says so in its own words: an evaluated candidate is never
  a finalized receipt.
* `finalized` — re-judged from the exact durable bytes and folded into Canon.
  This is the only rung this surface emits.

/-! ## Executable fixture and hostile paths

The fixture is the one the Signal judge and the finalized-run aggregate already
use, so a change to the judged transition moves these checks too.

⚑ **THE FIXTURES NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and the seventeen `native_decide`
pins below ran at elaboration (each accepted row costing two native judge invocations), so
a stale Records fixture was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace
(the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). The fixtures'
STATEMENTS stay here, each as an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition (a `def`
body elaborates without running), beside the private fixture rows and views they must
see. The EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` +
`#assert_compiled` — lives in `RecordsRuntimeFixtures.lean`, rooted in the
`PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale
fixture reds the guard library instead of the archive.

Fail-closed convention: a check that reads fields off a projected VIEW matches on the
`Option` and answers `false` on `none` — a broken projection fails the pin in the guard
library rather than wedging this module.

Named residue: NONE — no construction here demands a proof as data. -/

/-! ### The two published leaks, and their absence

⚠ Each needle below is checked to be a REAL needle before its absence is read.
A search for a string that is empty, or that is not actually the secret, would
pass while exercising nothing — an absence proof is only as good as the thing it
looked for. -/
