# Crew field mission runtime — the activation laboratory, out of the crypto archive

`CrewFieldMissionRuntime.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build
root). Its executable activation laboratory — the fixture world, every hostile case, every
`check_*` statement and the twenty-five `native_decide` pins over them — lives HERE, rooted in
the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down;
  * and nothing here is linked into the node. Lean computes every compiled no-argument `def`
    when its module initializes, so while the 08-08 split left the `check_*` definitions and
    their fixtures in the runtime module, three of them (`fixtureSafeResult`,
    `fixtureDeepResult`, `check_callable_entrypoint_emits_the_exact_successful_receipt`, each a
    full `judge` run) cost ~117 s of every node start on hbox (#86, 2026-10-01).

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged. The construction proofs `fixture_activation_valid` and
`rekeyed_crew_activation_is_valid` moved with the activations they build.

/-! ## The executable activation laboratory

The fixture world (`fixtureActivation`, `fixtureGenesis`, `fixtureSafeCommand`, the rekeyed
crew), every hostile case and every `check_*` statement live HERE, in a module `Dregg2.FFI`
does not reach. Lean computes every compiled no-argument `def` at module initialization, so a
fixture in the runtime module is a `judge` run on every node boot (#86); here it runs only where
it is pinned. The construction proofs `fixture_activation_valid` and
`rekeyed_crew_activation_is_valid` are here too, because the activations they build are. -/

/-! ### The sealed fixture activation

⚑ 2026-08-06.  What stood here was a `ReplayAuthority` whose `verify` was

    decide (record.session = fixtureRawActivation.fieldSession) &&
    decide (record.transcript.length = CrewFieldMission.CREW_SIZE)

— a session comparison and a length check, standing in for the module's
"cryptographic trust boundary".  It verified no signature and replayed nothing,
and every `native_decide` result below was evidence about THAT.  The transcripts
it judged carried `fixtureSignature` in both signature fields: one constant byte
pattern, identical for all four seats.

The activation now holds `CrewFieldMission.fixtureRunSeal`, and the transcripts
are the ones the kernel itself signed, re-encoded to the wire.  `sealSessionExact`
holds by `rfl` because the seal's config and this activation's `fieldSession` are
both `CrewFieldMission.fixtureRawConfig.sessionDigest` — two spellings the
elaborator has to agree on, not a value copied from one to the other.

`Activation`'s constructor is private to the runtime module, so the laboratory builds its
activation the way every caller must: through `activate?`, which re-checks validity AND the seal
session. Admission is proved from `fixture_activation_valid` and the seal session's `rfl`, so
the laboratory rests on no oracle the old in-module construction did not. -/

SEALED world rather than from a roster swapped in here.  It has to: since the
weld an `Activation` carries a `RunSeal`, and a seal can be minted only by the
kernel, because it holds a `Config` whose constructor is private.  The roster
substitution itself is unchanged — `CrewFieldMission.fixtureRekeyedRoster` is
