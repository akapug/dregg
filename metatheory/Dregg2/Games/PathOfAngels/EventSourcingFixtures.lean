# EventSourcing — the adversarial-teeth EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`EventSourcing.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build root), and
until 2026-08-08 its adversarial teeth ran eight `native_decide` pins at elaboration — so any
game-fixture regression was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace.
The teeth's STATEMENTS remain in `EventSourcing.lean` as evaluation-free `check_* : Bool`
definitions, beside the private fixtures they must see; THIS module is where they are RUN.
It is rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by
NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged. The hostile checks pin the EXACT refusal error, which
subsumes the old `fail_if_success` "not accepted" harness. Named residue: none.

These definitions were compiled into the `Dregg2.FFI` closure, and Lean computes every compiled
no-argument `def` when its module initializes: each `check_*` and fixture here ran on every node
boot. They live beside the pins that evaluate them now; nothing linked into the node reaches them. -/
