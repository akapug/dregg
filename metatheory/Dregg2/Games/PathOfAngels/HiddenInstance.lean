# HiddenInstance — the instance a descriptor commits to but does not carry

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget.  Rust and TypeScript dispatch what this module and
`Emit` produce; they do not carry a second copy of the derivation.

## The wound this module closes

Every shipped POAG1 descriptor stated its own answer.  `signal-triangulation.json`
carried `"target":[2,4,1]` as a top-level field.  `salvage-lock.json` carried the
glyph under each plate in `glyph_id`, and — unavoidably, in a tabulated machine —
in the successors of its transition table.  `relay-repair.json` carried
`instance.selected`.  The execution floor of Signal as emitted was ONE guess
against an information floor of four, and a Salvage run needed six exposures
against the ten a genuinely hidden board costs.

Deleting those fields alone would have closed NOTHING, and it is worth being
exact about why, because it is the trap this module exists to avoid.  Each game
derived its instance from `MissionSpec.runSeed`, and the run seed was published
in the descriptor AND in the catalog.  A client that reads `run_seed` and runs
`targetFromSeed` gets `[2,4,1]` whether or not the JSON spells it out.  Removing
the field would have silenced the gate that reported the hole while leaving the
hole exactly where it was.

So the run seed itself has to stop being a published constant.

## The split

* The descriptor publishes the RULES — the complete oracle, over the whole
  instance family — and a per-slot COMMITMENT.  It publishes no instance and no
  value from which one can be computed.
* The live `MissionSpec.runSeed` a judge uses is DERIVED, at judge time, from
  `(slot secret, slot, mission, player)`.  The curator draws the slot secret
  off-line, commits to it before the slot opens, and opens it after the slot
  closes.  The game kernels are untouched: they still bind their instance to
  `mission.runSeed` (`Config.target_eq`, `Config.seed_eq`, `Config.board_eq`),
  and that seed is now a per-run value nobody can predict.
* A browser plays PRACTICE against an instance it draws for ITSELF, under a
  client-chosen seed and the `practice` domain tag.  A practice stream is not a
  judged stream for any input, so a practice transcript can never be a judged
  one.

## What this is and is not

BINDING is what the commitment buys, and it is the property that makes a score
mean something between players: a curator cannot look at a transcript and then
choose the instance it was played against.  The strength of that binding is the
sponge capacity — eight lanes, about 248 bits, so roughly 2^124 for a collision.
That is the number, not the 2^248 of the output width.

HIDING from the OPERATOR is NOT bought and is not claimed.  Whoever holds the
slot secret knows every player's instance for that slot, in advance.  That is a
real residual and it is UNDONE WORK, not a theorem of the model: removing it
needs a beacon nobody can predict — a threshold or delay construction — feeding
the slot secret instead of a curator draw.  This module is written so that swap
is a change of where `SlotSecret` comes from and nothing else.

UNIFORMITY of the derived instance rests on the Poseidon2 permutation behaving
as a PRF.  That is an assumption, not a theorem, and no theorem below claims it.
What IS discharged here is the arithmetic that would otherwise sit UNDER that
assumption and quietly spoil it: the lane-to-byte projection rejects the one
value that would give byte 0 an extra preimage (`P = 256 * LANE_FIBRE + 1`), so
the byte stream `SeedDraw` consumes is exactly uniform GIVEN uniform lanes, and
`SeedDraw.draw_is_uniform_on_every_bound` carries it from there.  A counting
theorem over the 2^31 lane domain is deliberately absent: it would be a proof
about the inside of an assumption we cannot discharge, and its presence would
read as more assurance than exists.

## Hard facts respected

`Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm` has NO length guard: over sixteen lanes it silently
TRUNCATES and under sixteen it zero-fills.  `permute` therefore pads its argument
to exactly sixteen before every call and pads the result back, so no call site
can hand it a concatenation of digests.  Absorption is a rate-8 / capacity-8
sponge over 8-lane blocks, one byte per lane, and `digestBlocks` writes its four
slices out rather than recursing, so there is no chunking function whose
termination could drift.

`SeedDraw.drawBelow?` is the only draw used IN THIS MODULE.  `SalvageCrate.
unbiasedIndex?` cannot stream — `find?` then modulo re-reads the same byte — and
nothing here calls it.

⚠ **The qualifier "IN THIS MODULE" is load-bearing, and it was added the hard way.**
Until 2026-08-07 the sentence had no qualifier and was FALSE of the pipeline it
appeared to describe: a consumer draws its own instance out of the seed this module
hands it, and one of them did not use `SeedDraw` — `SignalTriangulation.targetFromSeed`
folded three of these bytes with `% 6`.  `256 = 42*6 + 4`, so the four low band symbols
came back 43/256 against 42/256: a 1.073x spread across the 216 targets and 0.0070 in
total variation from uniform.  The lane-to-byte projection above rejects ONE value to
keep the byte stream uniform and the very next hop folded FOUR back in.

**REPAIRED 2026-08-07.**  `SignalTriangulation.targetFromSeed?` is three
`SeedDraw.drawBelow? 6` on one consumed stream, `Config.target_eq` carries the
measurement, and there is no fallback: a seed that draws nothing has no configuration.
`SignalTriangulation.modulo_fold_is_not_uniform` keeps the fold refuted rather than
remembered.

⚠ And the scope of THAT claim, checked at source rather than assumed, because the
sentence this replaced was wrong in exactly this way.  The consumers that draw an
instance from a seed are: `SignalTriangulation` (now `drawBelow? 6`, x3),
`BlackBoxReconstruction` (5/4/3/2), `SalvageLock` (5/3/3), `VentCrawl` (`FACES`, x6),
`DeckDescent` (2, x3), `ArtificerLogic` (16) — all `SeedDraw` — and
**`RelayRepair.boardFromRunSeed`, which is a bare `% 8` and is NOT `SeedDraw`.**  That
one is exact anyway: `8` divides `256`, so the fold has no incomplete block and every
board has 32 preimages.  It is unbiased by arithmetic, not by rejection, and it is the
one place left where a change of bound would reintroduce this defect silently.

The lesson for this docblock outlives the defect: a claim about what "is used" reaches
past the module it is written in, and nobody re-checks it when a consumer is added.

## ⚑ `commit`, `runSeedFor` and `practiceRunSeed` are `@[irreducible]`, and why

MEASURED 2026-08-05, on hbox: `BazaarGameExamples` carried
`archived := by simp [archive, acquire]`, whose goal reaches `judgeActive` and therefore
`admissionChecks`, which mentions both functions.  With a run seed that was a literal
digest that `simp` was cheap.  With a DERIVED one it dragged seventeen Poseidon2
permutations through Lean's INTERPRETER: **47.6 GB resident and 68 minutes of CPU on one
file**, climbing into the 48 GB cgroup cap.

That is a property of the whole design, not of that one proof: every future `simp`,
`rfl` or `decide` that happens to reach a live seed would do the same, and it would look
like a slow build rather than a mistake.  `@[irreducible]` makes the elaborator treat a
draw as opaque — which is what it is, a sponge output — while `native_decide`, `#eval`
and the compiled export evaluate it exactly as before, because irreducibility is an
elaborator notion and the compiler ignores it.  ⚠ The KERNEL also ignores it, so a plain
`by decide` over a live seed is still a bomb; there is none in the tree and there should
never be one.

them is reconstructible from the published descriptor without the secret. -/

Taking a whole `MissionSpec` would have been a definitional cycle at every

/-! ## Fixtures

Concrete witnesses, so the claims above are refutable rather than decorative.

⚑ **THE FIXTURES NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).**  This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made every
game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the compilation-unit
coupling the stale-fixture outage measured).  The STATEMENTS stay here, each as an
evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition (a `def` body elaborates without running),
beside the private secrets and mission they are stated over.  The EVALUATION — each
`check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in
`HiddenInstanceFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain
`lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard library instead of
the archive.

⚠ This matters more here than anywhere: `commit`, `runSeedFor` and `practiceRunSeed` are
`@[irreducible]` precisely because a seventeen-permutation Poseidon2 draw through Lean's
interpreter cost 47.6 GB and 68 minutes on one file.  A `def` body does not run, so these
checks cost nothing to elaborate; only the guard library pays the sponge.

Named residue: NONE.  Nothing here needs a drawn seed as DATA — the fixtures are digests
and missions, and every claim about them is a Bool. -/
