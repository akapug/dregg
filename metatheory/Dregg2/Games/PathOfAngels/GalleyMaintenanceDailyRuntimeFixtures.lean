# Galley maintenance daily runtime — the fixture EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntime.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's
build root), and until 2026-08-08 its adversarial/end-to-end fixture block ran seventeen
`native_decide` pins at elaboration — so any fixture regression was a hard failure of every Rust
proving target in the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage
measured). The fixtures' STATEMENTS remain in `GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntime.lean` as
evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions, beside the private policy/viewer/carrier/authority
they exercise (which `GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntimeBoundary.adversarial_fixtures_are_private`
requires stay private); THIS module is where they are RUN. It is rooted in the
`PathOfAngelsGuards` library and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged. The fail-closed convention transfers: a check whose judge
call refuses answers `false`, so a broken prerequisite reds THIS module.

⚠ Named residue: NONE. `fixture_sponsor_wire_refuses_valid_caller_json` stayed behind as a
theorem in the parent because it is `rfl` (the sponsor wire is unconditionally the empty
string), not an evaluation, and its `#assert_axioms` census line stayed with it.

These definitions were compiled into the `Dregg2.FFI` closure, and Lean computes every compiled
no-argument `def` when its module initializes: each `check_*` and fixture here ran on every node
boot. They live beside the pins that evaluate them now; nothing linked into the node reaches them. -/
