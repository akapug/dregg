# Salvage Crate authored rotation

This downstream module is deliberately outside `SalvageCrate.lean`: besides
providing a concrete three-period rotation for the web/game layer, it proves that
ordinary consumers cannot construct persistent states or successful results.

/-! ⚑ **THE ROTATION PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and its `native_decide` pins ran at
elaboration, so any rotation regression was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the
workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). Two pins' STATEMENTS
stay here as evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions (a `def` body elaborates without
running); the EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`
— lives in `SalvageCrateExamplesFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library.

⚠ **Named residue, ONE construction proof.** `authored_rotation_config_valid` stays
`native_decide` HERE because `SalvageCrate.Config` carries its validity proof as DATA
(`config := ⟨raw, authored_rotation_config_valid⟩`), so building the authored rotation config
at all requires the proof at elaboration — and `config` is consumed outside this module
(`StationCrateOpen`, `StationDailyRuntime`), so it cannot become an `Option` either. Breaking
`configValidB` on the authored raw config therefore still reds this module (and the archive).
`generated_rotation_is_deterministic` also stays: it is `rfl`, not an evaluation, but its
statement names `config`, so its census line is `#assert_compiled`, not `#assert_axioms`. -/

/-- ⚑ The capability that gates `openCrate` cannot be minted from outside the

not reachable-by-anyone": `genesis`/`genesisCapability` and an accepted transition's
successor capability are the only producers, all inside `SalvageCrate`.  Making
`CurrentStateCapability.mk` public turns this red — and would hand every importer a
capability for any state it could name. -/
