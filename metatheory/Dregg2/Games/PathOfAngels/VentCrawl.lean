# Vent Crawl — one more rung, or come up with what you carry

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics.  Nothing here is an AIR, a
constraint system or a gadget.  Rust and the browser dispatch the table
`VentCrawlEmit` renders out of this module; they carry no second copy of the
rules.

## The shape

Two verbs.  From the mouth of a vent shaft you either **crawl** one rung deeper —
the salvage on the next rung is worth more and the water is closer — or you
**bank**, climbing out with everything in the sling.  A rung that floods takes
the whole unbanked sling.  A session is about two minutes.

## The two hidden things, and why they are different

Push-your-luck dies the moment the arithmetic is flat: if the multiplier always
outruns the hazard the answer is always CRAWL, and if it never does the answer is
always BANK.  Either way there is no game, only a ritual.  What keeps the
arithmetic live here is that the reward is drawn and the risk is not.

* **The hazard is PUBLIC, and it escalates.**  Entering rung `d` floods when the
  crawler's own draw falls below `d - 1` out of `FACES = 8`.  That number is in
  the descriptor, in every emitted row, and on the client before the choice is
  made: 1/8 into rung 2, rising to 5/8 into rung 6.  A player who wants to know
  the odds of the next rung is told the odds of the next rung.  There is no
  hidden die feel, because the die is not hidden — only its result is.
* **The reward is HIDDEN and SHARED.**  Which of eight `Vein`s the shaft is
  running today is drawn once per slot from the curator's slot secret, and it is
  the same vein for every crawler in that slot.  A run reads it the only way
  there is: by going down and looking at what the rungs pay.

That split is what this game is for.  The risk you can price exactly; the prize
you have to pay risk to learn.

## Two hidden things in the reward, and the second one is never free

The eight veins are four SEAMS crossed with what the bottom does.  A seam —
`barren`, `patchy`, `layered`, `lode` — is what rungs 2 to 5 pay, and it is
readable: the carries separate the four seams at rung 3.  The BOTTOM is the
second bit, and no rung before the bottom pays differently for it: the shaft
either PINCHES (`barren`, `patchy`, `layered`, `fools-lode`) or opens into a
POCKET (`barren-pocket`, `patchy-pocket`, `layered-pocket`, `motherlode`).

⚑ So there is no state in this game with nothing left to learn.  A crawler who
has read the seam is standing in front of the last rung holding exactly one
undecided bit, and it is the bit that pays the most — `the_bottom_rung_is_a_coin_flip_on_every_seam`
says the two veins still standing at every deepest decision WANT OPPOSITE MOVES.
`fools-lode` is what that costs: five rungs indistinguishable from the
motherlode, and then the seam closes to one.

## What the shared table buys, socially

Because the vein is one draw for the whole slot, a banked total is EVIDENCE.
`carriedAt 3` separates the four seams (`the_day_is_read_in_two_instalments`), so
the first crew to bank out of rung 3 has told the whole ship what kind of day it
is.  Nobody had to be given a channel for that; it falls out of the shape.  What
that crew CANNOT tell them is the bottom: only a transcript that reached rung 6
carries that, so the last rung is the one piece of news the wardroom board has to
buy at full price.

⚠ Two residuals, named rather than smoothed over:

* **A drowned run is under-reported.**  Nothing compels a crawler to submit a
  flooded transcript.  The consolation payout — the map, `intel`, because you
  mapped the shaft even if the water took the sling — exists so that submitting a
  drowning is worth the carrying turn, but it is an incentive and not a
  guarantee, and the public record therefore skews upward.

  ⚑ The map is PRICED, and this is the fix for a real defect: a consolation that
  paid a full rung of `intel` per rung reached and subtracted nothing made
  drowning STRICTLY BETTER than banking for anyone who wanted the map, so the
  deepest crawl was a free roll and there was no wager in the game at all for
  that player.  A run that comes home keeps its whole map (`mapBanked d = d`); a
  run the water takes keeps half of it (`mapDrowned d = d / 2`).  Half is still
  worth the carrying turn at every reachable drowning
  (`a_drowned_run_is_always_worth_submitting`) and it is never worth more than
  climbing out from where you stood (`the_map_that_drowns_is_never_worth_more`),
  which is exactly the property "the loss is a loss" the design gate rebuilds
  from the emitted ladders.
* **The late crawler free-rides.**  Whoever banks out of rung 3 first paid two
  rungs of hazard for the information; whoever reads the wardroom board gets it
  for nothing.  That is a real asymmetry and the deepening that closes it is a
  per-crawler perturbation of the vein — see the parameters section.

## Per-player, per-slot, per-mission — and the sentinel

The two draws come from the same commitment and the same sponge:

* the **vein** from `daySeedFor`, which is `HiddenInstance.runSeedFor` under a
  fixed sentinel player key `DAY_TABLE_KEY`, so it depends on the slot secret,
  the slot and the mission and NOT on who is crawling;
* the **flood tape** from `mission.runSeed`, which admission pins to
  `HiddenInstance.runSeedFor` for THIS player, so two crawlers on one vein still
  drown on different rungs.

⚠ The sentinel is a CONVENTION, not a proof.  A crawler whose signing-key digest
equalled `DAY_TABLE_KEY` would draw the day's vein as their own flood tape and
could read the vein off it.  That is a 256-bit constant collision against a value
nobody chose adversarially, and `the_day_table_is_not_a_player_stream` exhibits
the separation on a fixture rather than asserting it in general.  The structural
fix — a distinct sponge domain — belongs in `HiddenInstance`, which is not this
module's to edit this cycle.

## Toy parameters, and what deepening looks like

Every number below is v1-SMALL ON PURPOSE.  The shape is what is being claimed;
the size is not.

| parameter        | v1 | what deepening buys |
| ---------------- | -- | ------------------- |
| `DEPTH_CAP`      | 6  | more rungs = a longer tail and a finer stopping curve; the hazard formula already extends, but `floodBelow 9 = 8 = FACES` is certain death, so past rung 8 the ladder needs a second face count |
| `FACES`          | 8  | a wider die makes the hazard curve smoother and the near-misses finer-grained; 8 is chosen because it divides 256, so `SeedDraw.drawBelow?` never rejects a byte (`draw_below_eight_never_rejects`, an instance of `a_full_ceiling_never_rejects`) |
| veins            | 8  | more veins = more bits to learn and a slower collapse to certainty.  Eight is four seams times what the bottom does, which is the smallest family that keeps SOME question open at EVERY decision — and, like `FACES`, 8 divides 256 so the vein draw never rejects either.  The next size that keeps that is 16 |
| yield tables     | authored | the first thing to make drawn rather than authored: a per-rung yield draw would stop `carried` from being a function of `(depth, vein)` and would decouple two crawlers on one vein |
| the mouth cache  | 2  | a bigger mouth cache raises the stake of the very first crawl |

**The deepening I would do first** is the per-crawler vein perturbation: give each
crawler a private ±1 on the deep rungs, drawn from their own seed.  It costs one
more draw off a stream that already has 26 bytes spare, it breaks the free-ride
above, and it stops `carried` from being a public function of `(depth, vein)`.

## Hard facts respected

`Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm` reduces exponentially, and `HiddenInstance.commit`,
`runSeedFor` and `practiceRunSeed` are `@[irreducible]` because of it.  Nothing in
this file `decide`s or `rfl`s through `daySeedFor`; the fixture checks that mention
it are evaluated only under `native_decide`, in `VentCrawlFixtures.lean`.

`SeedDraw.drawBelow?` is the only draw used.  `SalvageCrate.unbiasedIndex?`
cannot stream — its `find?` then modulo re-reads the same byte — and nothing here
calls it.

/-! ## The vein — the shared daily table

Eight veins: four SEAMS by two BOTTOMS.  They agree at the mouth, split in two at
rung 2, separate into the four seams at rung 3 — and then hold there.  A seam's
two veins pay the SAME thing on rungs 2 through 5 and different things at rung 6,
so no carry short of the bottom can tell them apart.

That is the whole information design.  Rung 2 is a bet made blind; rung 3 buys
the seam; rungs 4 and 5 are priced against a seam that is known and a bottom that
is not; and rung 6 is the bit the crawler has to pay the deepest hazard to
collect.  ⚑ `VEINS = 8` is exactly the number of leaves that arrangement has, and

/-- ⚑ **The bottom of the shaft is the SHIP'S bit, not the vent's.**  A wet bilge
means the shaft bottoms out in water that is already in the ship and the last
rung pays its seam's PINCH; a dry one means it opens into the POCKET.  The seam
is still the day's own draw, so the eight-vein family is exactly what it was —
`the_day_and_the_bilge_name_every_vein` — but one of its three bits is now a fact
Deck Descent's mouth also reads.

⚠ This is the only place in the seven-game rack where two DIFFERENT GAMES read
one draw.  `DayWater` carries the calibration, both posteriors, and the proof
that neither family moved.

⚑ **CHANGED: the SEAM moved too, and it had to.**  Both bits now come off the
ship's own draw as one `DayWater.ShipDay`.  The seam used to be drawn from
`daySeedFor` — `HiddenInstance.runSeedFor` under the sentinel player key
`DAY_TABLE_KEY` — and that seed's header block carries the MISSION ID in lane 3,
so the "day's shared table" was shared only among crawlers of THIS mission.  The
descriptor's `vein_scope = "per-slot-shared"` said more than the derivation did.
`DayWater.the_ship_day_is_not_scoped_to_a_mission` is the defect as arithmetic on
the two header blocks, and `DayWater.the_day_carries_the_same_bilge` is the proof
that repairing it moved nothing about the coupling that already ships. -/

/-- ⚠ **AND THE STATEMENT THAT IS FALSE, kept refuted rather than deleted.**

The first draft of the theorem above asserted LIST EQUALITY — that mapping the
eight `(seam, bilge)` pairs yields `allVeins` itself — and `decide` proved its
NEGATION.  That refutation is recorded here because the reason is a trap: it is
not that the bijection fails, it is that two enumerations disagree on ORDER.
`DayWater.allBilge` lists the dry night first, while a WET night is the PINCH and
therefore index 0, so the flatMap emits each seam's POCKET before its PINCH and
`allVeins` lists them the other way round.

The distinction matters because `allVeins` order IS load-bearing on the wire —
`still_possible` and every wager row's haul list are rendered in it — while
`DayWater.allVeinDraws` is a proof-side enumeration that is rendered nowhere.  A
reader who saw the failed equality and concluded the coupling was unsupported
would be reading an ordering accident as a mechanism failure. -/

/-! ### ⚑ DELETED: `DAY_TABLE_KEY` and `daySeedFor`

The day's table used to be drawn by handing `HiddenInstance.runSeedFor` a
reserved sentinel PLAYER key.  Two things were wrong with it and only one was
written down.

The written one: a crawler whose signing-key digest equalled the sentinel would
draw the day's table as their own stream, and the docblock said "the structural
fix — a distinct sponge domain — belongs in `HiddenInstance`".
`DayWater.SHIP_DOMAIN` is that domain, and `the_ship_draw_is_not_a_player_draw`
is the separation as a fact about the preimage rather than about a constant
nobody chose adversarially.

⚠ The unwritten one, which is worse: `runSeedFor` goes through
`HiddenInstance.headerBlock`, whose lane 3 is the MISSION ID.  So the day's
"shared" table was scoped to a slot AND a mission, and could never have been read
by a second game even in principle.  `DayWater.the_ship_day_is_not_scoped_to_a_mission`.

Both are gone: the day is `DayWater.shipDayFor secret slot federationId
contentSession`, which takes no mission and no player. -/

/-! ## The reachable closure

Both branches of every wager are followed, so the closure is the set of states
reachable on SOME vein against SOME tape — exactly what a descriptor naming every
branch has to declare.

⚑ **THE MEASUREMENTS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made
every game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the
compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). Each measured property —
here, in the census/lines sections below, and the two Poseidon2 sentinel fixtures at the
bottom — stays as an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition (a `def` body elaborates
without running). The EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` +
`#assert_compiled` — lives in `VentCrawlFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards`
library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard
library instead of the archive.

Named residue: NONE. No construction in this module consumes a `native_decide` proof as
data, so every pin moved.  (`by decide` theorems — the carry ladder, the thin calls, the
map discount — never touch a sponge and stay.) -/

/-! ### The per-vein census

The tape is the crawler's dice, not the day: enumerating 8^6 tapes would be
enumerating luck.  What IS the instance family is the eight veins, and the census
below walks the real transition on each of them following BOTH outcomes of every
rung — which is exactly the set of positions a crawler on that vein can occupy. -/

/-- ⚑ **The veins are not relabellings of each other.**  The eight hidden draws
produce eight DIFFERENT deepest carries, so the bits that distinguish them buy a
crawler something — including the last bit, which no rung but the bottom pays
differently for.  (The reachable COUNTS coincide — the shaft is the same shaft —
which is why this is stated over the carries and not over the state census.) -/

/-! ## Config, judge and receipt

The judged surface is `DeckDescent`'s: a `Config` whose instance field is pinned
to the precommitted run seed by a proof obligation, a `terminalOutput` that fails
closed against the mission's own acceptance predicate, and a `judge` that binds
the transcript into the receipt.

⚠ The one difference, and it is the point of this game: the VEIN is not in the
`Config`.  It arrives in the `JudgeContext`, derived by the node from the slot
secret under `DAY_TABLE_KEY`, so there is no field for a host to set and no claim
for a client to make. -/

structure Config where
  mission : MissionSpec
  /-- The crawler's own rung draws. -/
  floods : FloodTape
  /-- What the bottom of the shaft pays on top of the salvage.  Declared in the
  config and checked against the mission's allowlist, so a run cannot invent a
  relic. -/
  deepRelic : RelicId
  relic_declared : deepRelic ∈ mission.allowedRelics
  /-- ⚑ The tape a run is judged against is the one its precommitted per-player
  seed draws.  A host cannot re-roll the water after reading the transcript. -/

/-- ⚑ The tape a run is judged on is the one its precommitted seed draws. -/
theorem judged_tape_is_the_drawn_tape (cfg : Config) :
    cfg.floods = floodTapeFromRunSeed cfg.mission.runSeed := cfg.floods_eq

/-! ### The map, and what the water does to it

⚑ The `intel` a run pays is the MAP: which rungs of this shaft were seen and what
they held.  Both outcomes pay it, because both outcomes saw the same rungs — and
that is the whole of the fix.  A consolation paid ONLY to a drowned run, or paid
at full rate to one, makes drowning the better outcome for anyone who wants the
map, and a crawler with an unpriced downside is not making a wager: the deepest
rung is a free roll and the game has no second verb for them.

So the map is paid on both and DISCOUNTED by the water.  A run that climbs out
brings its notes with it; a run the water takes leaves half of them in the shaft.
Half is still worth carrying home — that is the residual the consolation exists
for, and `a_drowned_run_is_always_worth_submitting` is the check — and it is
never worth more than climbing out from where you stood, which is
`the_map_that_drowns_is_never_worth_more`. -/

/-- What a run that comes home is paid for the shaft it mapped: one per rung
reached, all of it. -/
def mapBanked (depth : Nat) : Nat := depth

/-- And what survives a drowning: half the notes, rounded down. -/
def mapDrowned (depth : Nat) : Nat := depth / 2

/-- ⚑ **The map that drowns is never worth more than the map that climbs out.**
At every rung a crawler can stand on, drowning into the next one pays strictly
less map than banking right here — so the loss branch of every wager is a loss on
the map exactly as it is on the sling, and no posture is handed a free roll. -/
theorem the_map_that_drowns_is_never_worth_more :
    (List.range DEPTH_CAP).all (fun i =>
      decide (mapDrowned (i + 2) ≤ mapBanked (i + 1))) = true := by decide

/-- And strictly less from the second rung on, where a crawler has anything to
weigh: the tie at the mouth is the one place a drowning costs no map, because
there is no shallower rung to have come home from. -/
