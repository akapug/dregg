# WorldActivation — the honest/hostile witness EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`WorldActivation.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build root), and
until 2026-08-08 its witness section ran twelve `native_decide` pins at elaboration — so any
fixture regression was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace (the
compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). The witnesses' STATEMENTS remain
in `WorldActivation.lean` as evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions, beside the private
fixture envelopes and lineage they exercise; THIS module is where they are RUN. It is rooted in
the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged. The fail-closed convention transfers: a check whose
`Except` lands on any arm but the asserted one answers `false`, so a regression reds THIS
module.

⚠ Named residue: NONE. Nothing in `WorldActivation` demands a proof as data at construction,
so all twelve pins moved.

These definitions were compiled into the `Dregg2.FFI` closure, and Lean computes every compiled
no-argument `def` when its module initializes: each `check_*` and fixture here ran on every node
boot. They live beside the pins that evaluate them now; nothing linked into the node reaches them. -/
