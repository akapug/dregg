# Deck Descent — the POAG1 wire

Substrate note: this module renders bytes.  It authors no game semantics.  Every
verdict, successor and refusal reason below is read out of
`Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.DeckDescent`, and `descentDescriptorRefinesKernel`
parses the RENDERED bytes back and compares all 17,316 rows against `rowFor`.
There is no second model of the descent in this repository.

## Why this is not `Emit.lean`

`Emit.lean` and `EmitMain.lean` are held by the emit-authority lane this cycle.
The splice this module needs is four lines and it is stated at the bottom of this
file rather than performed in a file another lane is editing.

## What the descriptor carries, and what it cannot

The board is a draw from SIX — does the mouth flood, and which spur (if either)
the lower deck let water into — and the descriptor names none of them.  What it names instead is
a table in which every row that consults a bit carries BOTH successors
(`step_is_one_of_the_two_branches`), and a `shaft` block giving the public rules:
the topology, the two budgets, the carrying capacity, the bank target, how many
relics each chamber holds (two on the east spur — the measured junction repair)
and the tie-break the deck uses when a crossing overruns the sling.

⚑ The `shaft` block exists so `scripts/poa-design-gate.py` can rebuild the rule
from the descriptor and check every emitted row against its own reconstruction,
rather than analysing a table it has to take on trust.  It must NOT be called
`rules`: the gate dispatches its backend on document SHAPE, and a top-level
`rules` key routes to the deduction backend.

⚑ It also must not become a place to put the board.  Everything in it is a
statement about the shaft that is true on all six instances.

/-! ## Action metadata

`kind` and `line` are what let a reader rebuild `Action.target` from the shaft
block: a `spur` action reaches the node's spur child, a `main` action its main
child, and a `here` action reaches nothing — it acts where the body stands. -/

/-- ⚑ **`line` really does determine the target.**  A client that rebuilds
`Action.target` from the emitted `line` and the emitted child maps gets exactly
the kernel's answer, at every node.  Without this the metadata would be a label
and the gate's reconstruction would be a second rule. -/

/-- A parametric row.  `refuse` carries a named reason and no successor;
`accept` is board-independent and carries one; `resolve` consults one bit and

⚠ `on_match` is the SOUND reading and `on_mismatch` the FLOODED one, matching
`rowFor`'s `stepWith Lore.sound` / `stepWith Lore.flooded`.  A reader should not
have to take that on trust and does not have to: the two branch views differ in
exactly one chamber's `lore`, and that chamber's value in each branch says which

/-! ### The practice family — all six boards, and no answer

⚑ **PUBLISHING THE FAMILY IS NOT PUBLISHING THE INSTANCE**, and here the family
was already public before this block existed.  `shaft` names three chambers and
declares `lore` and `damaging_lore`; every `resolve` row names two successors
whose views differ in exactly one chamber's reading, and those two readings ARE
`sound` and `flooded`.  From that alone `scripts/poa-design-gate.py` rebuilds all
six boards and walks them — it did so before this block was written and reads
nothing from it now.  So the bits are all already there; what this block removes
is the RULE a client would otherwise have to carry ("each chamber is
independently sound or flooded") in order to enumerate them.  A lookup replaces a
second model of the game.

⚠ What it still says nothing about is WHICH board a run drew.  A judged run's
board comes from `HiddenInstance` under purpose tag 1 off a slot secret this
artifact does not contain and could not; a practice run picks a row here, under a
client-chosen index, and is `scored:false` in the block and `mode:"practice"` in
the transcript.  A reader who has not played can reconstruct the six; nobody
can reconstruct the one. -/

/-! ## ⚠ The falsifiers, built constructively from the live encoder

Each mutant is rendered by `descriptorFrom` — the SAME function that renders the
honest bytes — from a deliberately wrong row list.  A falsifier that edits a
string it expects to find has, twice in this repository, stopped falsifying when
the string left the fixture: the mutation replaced nothing and the hostile input
equalled the honest one.  So each theorem below asserts the mutation HAPPENED
before it reads the verdict. -/

/-! ## The pins

⚑ **THE PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made every
game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the compilation-unit
coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). Each pin's STATEMENT stays here, as an
evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition over the live validators and falsifiers (a
`def` body elaborates without running). The EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `DeckDescentEmitFixtures.lean`, rooted in
the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale
descriptor reds the guard library instead of the archive.

Named residue: NONE — every pin moved. -/

/-! ## Handover — what `Emit.lean` and `EmitMain.lean` must splice

Four edits, all additive except the third:

1. `EmitMain.lean`: `import Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.DeckDescentEmit` and, in
   `emitDescriptors`, `writeAtomic (dir / "games" / "deck-descent.json")
   DeckDescentEmit.deckDescentDescriptorJson`.
2. `scripts/check-poag1-artifacts.sh`: add `games/deck-descent.json` to
   `content_paths` and to `expected`, and pass its SHA-256 the way the other
   three are passed.  ⚑ This changes `content_root_sha`, so the manifest bytes
   change and the curator signature must be re-taken.  That is a rebuild, not a
   migration — but it is a CURATOR act, so it is named here and not performed.
3. `Emit.lean`: delete the private `jsonString`, `jsonArray`, `jsonPrettyArray`,
   `jsonBool`, `exactKeys`, `validateInstanceDeclaration` and
   `validateHiddenSecurity`, and `open Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.EmitJson`
   instead.  They are byte-identical to this module's copies TODAY; the reason to
   converge is that two copies of `instanceDeclarationJson` is two descriptions
   of where an instance comes from.
4. `lakefile.toml`: `PathOfAngelsGuards` roots `EmitJson`, `DeckDescentEmit` and
   `DeckDescentEmitMain`.  ✅ DONE 2026-08-06 by the descent lane; the whole
   target builds green on hbox (3179 jobs) and this module's five
   `#assert_compiled` pins run there.

5. ⚑ Baseline: NOTHING to add.  The enrollment commit used to owe
   `deck-descent/the-family-collapses` and `deck-descent/the-spurs-are-one-spur`
   in the same commit; those findings were REPAIRED on 2026-08-06 — the east
   spur's second relic broke the mirror (`Chamber.relicCount`,
   `the_mirror_is_broken`) — and the gate now reports 0 FAIL / 0 WARN for this
   game, measured on the re-emitted bytes.  So enrolling the descriptor into
   `poa/artifacts/poag1/games/` needs NO descent baseline entries — but re-run
   the gate at enrollment and believe ITS answer, not this comment: a baseline
   entry for a finding the gate does not produce is a VANISHED entry and exits
   1, exactly as an unbaselined new finding does.  `test-poa.sh` runs the gate
   with the checked-in baseline and no `--games-dir`, so today it sees three
   games and passes; the pending directory is why it is not already red.

Until (1) and (2) land, the descriptor is emitted by
`Dregg2/Games/PathOfAngels/DeckDescentEmitMain.lean` into
`poa/artifacts/poag1-pending/games/`, which is deliberately NOT the signed bundle
directory: `check-poag1-artifacts.sh` refuses any file under
`poa/artifacts/poag1/` that is not in its `expected` list, and a game the curator
has not signed for does not belong in a signed bundle. -/
