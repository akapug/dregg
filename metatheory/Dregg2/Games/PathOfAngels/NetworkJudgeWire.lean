# Path of Angels — strict judged-RUN network wire

This is the deliberately small text boundary used by the internal settlement
evaluator.  The request is untrusted, but `config`/`canon`/`carrier` become
authoritative only when the node adapter derives them from persisted activated
state and the finalized SignedTurn; this codec does not authenticate their origin.
JSON is used only as a transport syntax.  Accepted bytes
must equal Lean's compact encoder byte-for-byte, so whitespace, reordered keys,
unknown fields, alternate number spellings, uppercase digests, and trailing bytes
all refuse.

Syntax parsing and semantic construction are separate.  The wire structures are
proof-erased and bounded; `GameConfigWire.toSemantic?` and
`WorldStateWire.toSemantic?` rebuild the proof-carrying game types.

## ⚑ FLAG DAY 2026-08-09 — `POA-SIGNAL-IN-1` is GONE; this wire is `POA-RUN-IN-1`

`Judged.judgeActive` has been generic over six games since it was written
(`ActiveGame` = signal | relay | salvage | blackBox | deckDescent | ventCrawl) and
`Judged.admissionChecks` names no game at all.  The ONLY thing that made the
network settle exactly one of them was this file: `config` was a
`SignalConfigWire` and `request.actions` was a `List CodeWire`, so a Vent Crawl
transcript had no way to reach a judge that was already willing to score it.

What changed is the two game-specific fields and nothing else:

* `config` is a `GameConfigWire` — a sum whose FIRST KEY is `"game"`, so the blob
  is self-describing wherever it is stored on its own (persistence keeps the
  active config as its own sealed bytes; a tag carried only by the enclosing
  request would leave that blob ambiguous);
* `request.actions` is an `ActionsWire`, and `parseRequest` takes the tag READ OFF
  THE CONFIG rather than a second tag of its own.  There is no second tag to
  disagree with the first — a two-tag wire would need a cross-check, and a
  cross-check is a thing that can be forgotten.

⚠ **What re-emits.**  Every persisted `poa_signal_heads_v1` config blob, every
`poa_signal_transitions_v1` input/output blob, and the checked-in judge fixture
`dregg-lean-ffi/tests/fixtures/poa-signal-input-v1.json` are the OLD shape and
**refuse to decode** — they name a format string that no longer exists.  A node
carrying them must be re-genesised.  That is the intended outcome: the old bytes
do not get reinterpreted under the new schema, they fail the format compare in
`parseInputJson` and return the `""` sentinel.

⚠ **What did NOT change.**  `MissionWire`, `WorldStateWire`, `CanonStateWire`,
`FinalizedCarrierWire`, `SlotStateWire`, the whole receipt/output wire, and every
identity/counter field of the request are byte-identical and shared by every game.
The per-game cost is exactly one config variant, one action variant, and one arm
in `NetworkJudge.settle` — which is the number that prices the remaining games.

The emitted POAG1 bundle publishes `games/signal-triangulation.json` and
`games/vent-crawl.json`, and `poa-curator`'s `validate_game_descriptor_mission_match`
already checks each descriptor's `game_id` against the catalog.  A third spelling on
the judge wire would be a third thing to keep in agreement, and the failure would be
silent: a node tagging a run `"vent"` would simply never reach the vent arm and would
report a format refusal instead of a wrong-game one. -/

/-! ## ⚑ Which limit bounds a relic ID

Three constants are called a relic limit and **none of the other two bounds an id**:

* `RELIC_LIMIT = 64` — how many relics ONE CONTRIBUTION may carry.  It is a COUNT
  everywhere it appears: `Contribution.relics_bounded` is a `card`,
  `ContributionBudget.relics : Fin (RELIC_LIMIT + 1)` is a count, and
  `parseNatList … RELIC_LIMIT` bounds the list's **length**.
* `MISSION_RELIC_LIMIT = 4096` — how many relics ONE MISSION may ALLOW.  Also a
  `card` (`MissionSpec.allowed_relics_bounded`).
* `MAX_RELICS_PER_MISSION = 16` in `poa-curator` — the signer's per-mission COUNT
  cap, and therefore the width of a relic block (`MISSION_RELIC_BLOCK`).

`WIRE_ID_LIMIT` is the id ceiling, and `strictNatListB` is where the two meet: its
`limit` argument bounds the list's LENGTH while every VALUE is checked against
`WIRE_ID_LIMIT`.  Reading `parseNatList … RELIC_LIMIT` as "a relic id is at most 64"
is the misreading these theorems exist to close: Deck Descent's ids 80..83 are
wire-legal, and were before the partition too. -/

/-- A block's ids are wire-representable exactly while the mission id is under
`WIRE_ID_LIMIT / MISSION_RELIC_BLOCK` — i.e. the scheme carries 2^28 missions before
an id stops fitting the transport, which is the real bound on how far it scales. -/
theorem relicSlot_wire_representable (mission : MissionId) {slot : Nat}
    (hmission : mission.value < (WIRE_ID_LIMIT + 1) / MISSION_RELIC_BLOCK)

/-- Every id in the block of every mission the bundle can publish is wire-representable
— over the WHOLE block, not over the allowlists that happen to be declared today, so a
mission adding a slot cannot leave the range this checked.

⚠ The range is mission ids `0..8` inclusive, not `0..7`: `poa-curator`'s
`MAX_MISSIONS_PER_EPOCH = 8` caps the COUNT of missions in an epoch, and mission ids
start at 1, so the eighth game is id **8**.  `List.range 8` would stop one short of the
mission this is meant to cover. -/

/-! ### ⚑ The transcript bound is PER GAME, and it is the game's own clock

`WIRE_ACTION_LIMIT` was `SignalTriangulation.MAX_TURNS` and could not be anything
else while one game settled.  It is now a function of the tag, and each arm is the
kernel's OWN bound rather than a number restated here:

* Signal's is `MAX_TURNS = 5` — the burst budget of a deduction run.
* Vent Crawl's is `VentCrawl.ACTION_LIMIT = DEPTH_CAP = 6` — and it is not a budget
  at all, it is the shaft.  `VentCrawl.replayB_length_le_fuel` proves no accepted
  transcript can be longer, because every accepted action either goes one rung
  deeper or ends the run.  Bounding it here at 5 would refuse the ONE transcript
  that reaches the bottom rung, which is the transcript the whole game is about;
  bounding it at some larger number would admit prefixes `replay` refuses one step
  later, after the player paid the carrying turn to find out.

A wire limit that is not the kernel's own limit is a second rule. -/

  `floodTapeFromRunSeed mission.runSeed`, so `toSemantic?` DERIVES it and there is
  no field a wire could name a different tape in.
* No `reward` — what a Vent Crawl run pays is `VentCrawl.terminalOutput` of the rung
  it banked from, not a constant.  `Judged.GameConfigClaim.ventCrawl` carries no
  reward for the same reason.
* No vein.  It is a per-SLOT draw the judge derives from the committed slot secret
  in `Judged.ventCrawlContext`; a wire field for it would be a field a host could

/-- ⚑ **An empty transcript is refused HERE, at the wire, for every game.**

It used to be refused one layer up and only for Signal (`NetworkJudge.signalActions?`
matched `[]` and returned `none`).  Stating it once at the boundary means a game
enrolled later cannot forget it — and it is the honest place, because "a run with no
rounds is not a game" is a fact about runs, not about Signal.

Both kernels would refuse it anyway: `SignalTriangulation.replay []` returns the
initial state whose `solved` is false, and `VentCrawl.replayB … []` returns
`initialState` whose outcome is `crawling`, which `terminalOutput` refuses. -/

arise: `parseRequest` is handed the config's tag, so the two are one decision, and this

/-! ## Emitted Signal fixture

⚑ **THE FIXTURE PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build root — and the thirteen `native_decide` pins
below ran at elaboration, so a stale Signal-wire fixture was a hard failure of every Rust
proving target in the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage
measured). The pins' STATEMENTS stay here, each as an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool`
definition (a `def` body elaborates without running), beside the fixture values they exercise.
The EVALUATION — each `check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives
in `NetworkJudgeWireFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain
`lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard library instead of the
archive.

⚠ Named residue, one construction proof: `fixtureTarget_is_the_drawn_instance` stays
`native_decide` HERE because `fixtureConfig` consumes it as DATA — it discharges
`Config.target_eq` inside `Emit.signalConfigWith`, so it must elaborate where the config is
built. A fixture target that drifts from its seed's draw therefore still reds this module
(and the archive). Everything else moved. -/

The draw is partial, so a fixture cannot derive its target at construction and stay
total.  It CARRIES the measured value instead, and `fixtureTarget_is_the_drawn_instance`
is the measurement.  That measurement is the only new compiled-evaluation obligation in
this file: `fixtureRunSeed` is a Poseidon2 output, so `targetFromSeed?` of it cannot
reduce in the kernel — for the same reason, and with the same remedy, as
`BazaarGameExamples.live_run_seed_is_the_derived_draw`.

⚠ Carrying it is strictly BETTER for the kernel than deriving it was.  Before this
change the config's target field was the term `targetFromSeed (runSeedFor …)`, so
every downstream reduction that touched the target had a sponge under it; now it is
a literal. -/

`Config` now carries a PROOF FIELD (`target_eq`), and the measurement discharging it
here is compiled.  A `Config` term therefore drags that compiled axiom behind it, so
every fact stated ABOUT `fixtureConfig` — including facts about its mission, which have
nothing to do with the draw — would silently stop being kernel-clean.  That is exactly
what happened when this was written the obvious way: `fixtureMissionContext_is_the_live_context`
went from `#assert_axioms`-clean to depending on a `native_decide` axiom, for a statement
about a projection that does not mention the target at all.

Naming the mission on its own keeps the two apart.  Facts about the MISSION reduce in the
kernel; the one fact that genuinely needs compiled evaluation — that the carried target is
the drawn one — is isolated in `fixtureTarget_is_the_drawn_instance` and pinned with
`#assert_compiled`.  The config's own mission field is this term definitionally. -/

/-! ### ⚑ The SECOND game — a real Vent Crawl run on the very same wire

Everything below reuses the Signal fixture's identities, slot, secret and curator
UNCHANGED.  That is the point of it: the only things that differ are the mission
(`Emit.ventMission`, id 7), the config variant, and the transcript.  If this settles,
the generalisation is real and not a second pipeline wearing the first one's name.

⚠ **The transcript is `[bank]`, and it is chosen for DETERMINISM, not for drama.**
`VentCrawl.openB` admits `bank` from the initial state on every vein and every flood
tape, so this fixture's verdict does not depend on the sponge output — a run that
crawled would settle or refuse according to a tape nobody can predict at authoring
time, and a fixture whose expected verdict is unknown is not a pin.  It is a real
judged run all the same: the crawler climbs out at the mouth with the cache in the
sling, which is a legal terminal state of the actual game.

⚠ **And it does NOT demonstrate the interesting run.**  A `[crawl, …]` transcript is
what makes Vent Crawl the rack's one genuinely good game, and pinning one needs the
drawn tape measured first.  Not done here; named so nobody reads this pin as more than
it is. -/
