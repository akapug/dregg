# CrewFieldMissionAdmission — where a crew activation STOPS being the caller's, and
where the RUN SEAL stops being an argument

`CrewFieldMissionRuntime.activate?` takes a `CrewFieldMission.RunSeal` **as a
parameter**.  It checks that the seal's session equals the authored field session and
nothing else, because there is nothing else it *can* check: a seal is opaque.  So the
question "which seals exist, publicly?" is the whole security of the organ, and until
this module the answer was:

* `CrewFieldMission.fixtureRunSeal` and `CrewFieldMission.fixtureRekeyedRunSeal` —
  both **public**, both carrying the fixture signature suite whose `verifySeat` /
  `verifyHandoff` accept a constant byte pattern derived from the seat's own public
  fields, i.e. a signature anyone can compute; and
* `CrewFieldMission.ProductionSigning.activate?`, which is real but consumes a
  `RawConfig` that **had no codec**, so nothing on a wire could reach it.

An `@[export]` shaped `(activation, requestBytes) → String` therefore could not exist:
the only activations a host could build were built from a fixture seal, and
`fixtureRunSeal` completing a seat is "anyone completes any seat" — which is exactly
what the kernel's own docblock says a seal must prevent.  That is why this organ, with
a landed ML-DSA-65 suite and a landed per-handoff step surface, still had **zero
`@[export]`**.

## What this module does

`authorizeCrewActivationForWorld?` is
`ActivatedContent.authorizeEmbeddedGalleyPolicyForWorld?` /
`NightWatchCampaignAdmission.authorizeCampaignConfigForWorld?` for this organ, with one
addition that is the point of the file:

1. it locates `poa.crew-field-mission.activation.v1` by exact name inside an activated
   manifest whose SHA-256 root IS the audited world's `contentRoot`;
2. it decodes those bytes **canonically** — parse, re-encode, demand byte equality, so
   one activation has exactly one spelling — into `CrewFieldMissionRuntime.RawActivation`;
3. it **MINTS** the seal, inside the witness, by calling
   `CrewFieldMission.ProductionSigning.activate?` on a `RawConfig` reconstructed from
   the admitted `fieldSession`.  The seal is a **function of the admitted bytes**.  It
   is not an argument, it is not a field of the request, and there is no constructor
   of this witness that takes one.

Because `ProductionSigning.activate?` pins `messageDigestSuiteId` and `signingSuiteId`
to the production suite ids structurally, an admitted document whose session names the
FIXTURE suite mints **no seal at all**, and therefore reaches no activation and no step
surface.  The fixture-seal ban is a refusal of the minting function, not a convention:
see `a_fixture_suited_activation_in_an_exactly_matching_world_mints_no_seal`.

## Why a `RawConfig` can be reconstructed from a `SessionDigest`

`CrewFieldMission.RawConfig` and `CrewFieldMission.SessionDigest` carry the same
fourteen fields, and `RawConfig.sessionDigest` is the field-for-field projection.
`configOfSession` is its inverse, and `configOfSession_sessionDigest` /
`sessionDigest_configOfSession` prove the round trip in both directions by `rfl` after
`cases`.  So "the session the activation authored" and "the config the seal is issued
over" are one document, not two that agree today.  Nothing is invented at the seam:
`ProductionSigning.activate?` still runs the full `rawConfigValidB` — roster shape,
briefing-deck commitment under the production SHAKE-256 boundary, mission-identity
agreement, budget floor, route-outcome table — over exactly those bytes.

## What this does NOT buy

**Signature verification of the WORLD is `WorldActivation`'s, at the persistence
seam**, exactly as it is for Galley and Night Watch.  This module proves membership in
a world it is HANDED; a caller that hands it a world nobody audited gets a witness
about nothing.  That is the same boundary `ActivatedContent`'s docblock draws, not a
new one — and it is why the export below is safe only when mounted behind the same
audited-world seam Galley's is.

⚠ The seal-minting closure is INDEPENDENT of that boundary and is the part that is
new: even a caller that fabricates a world and a manifest cannot obtain a
fixture-suited seal, because minting refuses the fixture suite before the world is
ever consulted.

⚠ Nothing yet EMITS a `poa.crew-field-mission.activation.v1` component — `Emit` has no
renderer for one — so today the only manifests carrying one are the fixtures below.

⚠ `raw.contentDigest` and `content.deck.activation.contentRoot` are deliberately NOT
pinned to `world.contentRoot`.  The world's content root is the SHA-256 of the manifest
that embeds this very activation, so pinning either would be a cycle.  What IS pinned
to the world is the federation, the content session, and the deck's own signed
activation identity (`contentEpoch`, `activationDigest`) — the fields
`DeckGraph.ActivationIdentity` documents as "carried by the externally signed
activation statement", which `DeckGraph.validateB` explicitly does not authenticate and
which were therefore free for a caller to choose.

## Flag day

`poa.crew-field-mission.activation.v1` is a NEW component name and
`POA-CREW-FIELD-ACTIVATION-1` a new document format; nothing emitted one before, so
nothing re-emits.  The `@[export dregg_poa_crew_field_step]` below is new and its
`REQUIRED_DECISION_EXPORTS` row lands with it.

/-! ## The two hex spellings are one spelling

`Emit.bytes32Hex` (this module, and every manifest) and
`CrewFieldMission.ProductionSigning.digestHex` (the signing preimages, and therefore
`sessionJson`) are separate functions in separate modules with separate private
`byteHex` helpers.  Both are a `String.join` over a per-byte map, so agreement on all
256 byte values is agreement on every digest — this is the whole domain of the
function they differ in, not a sample of digests. -/

/-! ## The ENTRY POINT — the seat-admission preimage, and its export

⚑ 2026-08-09.  `stepWire` above answers "what does the next seat sign?", and it answers
it only for a caller that can already present that seat's ML-DSA-65 SEAT-ADMISSION
envelope.  Producing that envelope requires knowing the seat-admission preimage bytes,
and until this section nothing emitted them: they were reachable only by evaluating
`CrewFieldMission.ProductionSigning.seatPreimageJson` inside Lean.  A browser that
re-derived them would be building the exact body the step surface's own docblock
forbids a client to build — "a client signs THESE BYTES; it does not build a body,
does not derive a `preRoot`, and does not re-encode anything."  So the organ had a
handoff surface and no way to take the first seat.

The read below is the same admission path as `stepWire` — the manifest is located by
exact component name inside a manifest whose SHA-256 root IS the audited world's
`contentRoot`, decoded canonically, and the seal is MINTED from those bytes — and it
takes no `RunSeal` and no `Activation` argument, for the same structural reason. -/

sound rather than convenient: `CrewFieldMissionRuntime.Activation` carries
`sealSessionExact : runSeal.session = raw.fieldSession` as a PROOF FIELD, and
`RunSeal.session` is the seal's own `config.raw.sessionDigest`.  So the session this
reads and the session `authenticateSeat?` checks against are the same document by the
activation's construction, not by agreement. -/

/-- ⚑ WHY THIS SURFACE MAY BE PUBLIC, AND WHY THE HANDOFF ONE MAY NOT.

`RunSeal.nextSigningPreimage?` is gated behind seat authentication because a
`HandoffBody` carries an `observation` — the seat's private briefing — so an ungated
handoff surface would publish the next seat's briefing to anyone who asked.  A
`SeatAdmissionBody` carries a session and a seat and NOTHING ELSE.  This theorem is
that difference, stated: the emitted preimage is a function of the field session alone,
and the field session is verbatim inside `activationJson raw`, which IS the manifest
component the caller handed in.  It therefore confers nothing on a caller that the
bytes it already supplied do not. -/

/-! ## The admitted fixture — a production-suited crew in an activated world

Deployment-free test vectors, not canon.  ⚠ This crew is NOT
`CrewFieldMission.katRawConfig`: the KAT world inherits
`DeckGraph.fixtureActivation`'s ALL-ZERO federation and content session, and
`WorldActivation.validWorld` refuses a zero federation, so a KAT-sessioned activation
could never be a member of any valid world.  The identity fields below are therefore
authored nonzero — which re-bases the session, and therefore invalidates every
signature bound to the KAT session.

## ⚑ 2026-08-09 — this fixture used to pass the door and be unable to play

The paragraph above used to end "which costs the real ML-DSA-65 keypair ... and buys
an activation that an audited world can actually carry", and the roster below was
`CrewRelayExpedition.fixtureRoster` — player keys `digestFilled 10..13`, i.e.
`0a0a0a…`, `0b0b0b…`, `0c0c0c…`, `0d0d0d…`.  The config also names the PRODUCTION
signing suite, whose `verifySeat` is `verifyEnvelope`, which demands
`SHAKE256(publicKey, 32) = playerKey` before it will run FIPS 204 verify at all.

**No ML-DSA-65 public key digests to `0a0a0a…`.**  So `authenticateSeat?` could never
accept for any seat of this crew, and the organ's own demonstration material was an
activation that MINTED, was ADMITTED to its world, and then refused every single step
— measured: `admittedMember?.isSome = true`, `stepWire <honest envelope> = ""`.  Every
refusal tooth below was passing over a crew that had no accepting pole to contrast
with, which is the vacuity class in the module that exists to demonstrate the fix.

The roster is now four REAL ML-DSA-65 public keys.  Seats 0 and 1 reuse the two
keypairs already pinned in `CrewSigningVectors`; seats 2 and 3 are pinned here, from
the same deterministic `keygen_from_seed` harness, because a four-seat crew in which
two seats can never act still cannot complete a run.

⚠ **TEST MATERIAL — NEVER DEPLOY THIS CREW.**  All four secret keys are derivable by
anyone from the pinned xi seeds below, exactly as `CrewSigningVectors` says of the KAT
keypair.  A real crew's player keys are its players' own; these exist so that the
accepting pole of this organ is checkable, and for no other purpose.

Provenance, reproducible: `ml_dsa_65::KG::keygen_from_seed(xi)` with
`xi = b"POA-CREW-ADMITTED-SEAT2-XI-0003!"` and `b"POA-CREW-ADMITTED-SEAT3-XI-0004!"`,
through the `crew-kat-gen` harness whose complete source is reproduced at the bottom of
`CrewSigningVectors.lean`.  The end-to-end drive — seat preimages out of
`seatPreimageWire`, signatures in from `fips204` 0.4.6, the handoff out of `stepWire` —
is `metatheory/scripts/crew_playable_handoff.lean`. -/

/-! ### The ENTRY POINT's own poles, over the admitted crew -/

/-! ## Teeth

⚑ **THE TEETH NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made every
game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the compilation-unit
coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). The witnesses (`admittedRaw`, the hostile
mutations, their manifests and worlds) stay here as evaluation-free `def`s; the sixteen
pins — every statement below names only public values and moves VERBATIM, except the
hex-agreement pin, which is stated over the private `uniformDigest` and therefore stays
as `check_the_manifest_hex_and_the_signing_hex_agree_on_every_byte_value` above — live in
`CrewFieldMissionAdmissionFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a
plain `lake build` still runs every pin, and a stale fixture reds the guard library
instead of the archive.

⚠ Named residue: none.  Nothing in this module needs a fixture proof as data. -/

/-! ### The refusal pole — the fixture seal, structurally

`CrewFieldMission.fixtureRunSeal` is public and its verifier accepts a byte pattern any
reader can compute.  `CrewFieldMissionRuntime.activate?` pins
`runSeal.session = raw.fieldSession`, so the document a holder of that seal MUST
publish is one whose field session carries the fixture suite ids — and the suite ids
below are read off `fixtureRunSeal.session` itself rather than re-authored, so this is
that document and not a lookalike.

⚠ Everything else is the admitted crew: same roster, content, policy, route table and
mission identity, and the world is re-rooted at the re-hashed manifest.  So
`activationValidB` still holds and `matchesWorldB` still passes — both asserted below —
and the ONLY thing that refuses is the mint.  (The fixture seal's own session cannot be
used verbatim: it inherits `DeckGraph.fixtureActivation`'s zero federation, which
`validWorld` refuses, and the refusal would then be over-determined and prove nothing
about the suite.) -/

/-! ### Codec-shape refusals, on the real decoder -/

-- The sixteen pins (`#assert_compiled` + `native_decide`) live in
-- `CrewFieldMissionAdmissionFixtures.lean`, rooted in `PathOfAngelsGuards` — see the
-- Teeth header above.
