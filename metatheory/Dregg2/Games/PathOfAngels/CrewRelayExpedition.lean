# CrewRelayExpedition — the shared crew vocabulary

⚑ 2026-08-06 — this module used to be a 1,381-line asynchronous signed relay
kernel: `Config`, `State`, `CanonicalRunAdmission`, `SeatCapability`,
`SignedTurn`, `transition`, `execute`, `replay`, and a canonical settlement
registry.  **All of it is deleted.**  Nothing in the tree ever called it.  Its
only external mentions were its own `CrewRelayExpeditionBoundary`, whose twenty
`fail_if_success` teeth asserted that its constructors were unreachable — a
module proving that another module could not be used, next to a runtime that
shipped.  `CrewFieldMission` is the surviving relay: it never called this one,
and reused exactly the leaf types below.

⚠ The name is now wrong.  What remains is a vocabulary, not an expedition.  The
rename is not done here because nine importers spell this namespace and six of
them belong to other lanes' files.

What survives is the vocabulary those importers actually consume: who a seat is,
what role it holds, and which eight commands a crew can play.

`.abort` and `.restart` went with the machine.  They were the deleted relay's
terminal and recovery moves; no surviving consumer can accept one, and their
presence forced `Command.role`/`Command.strategy` to be partial for branches
nothing could reach.  Both are now total.

/-! ## Fixture roster

Four seats with distinct player keys, credentials and counter origins.  Used by
`CrewFieldMission` and by `CrewFieldMissionRuntime`'s activation fixtures.

⚑ **THE ROSTER PIN NO LONGER EVALUATES IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).** This module is in the
`Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made a game-fixture
regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target (the compilation-unit coupling the
stale-fixture outage measured). The STATEMENT stays here as an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool`
definition (a `def` body elaborates without running); the EVALUATION — `= true`, pinned by
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in `CrewRelayExpeditionFixtures.lean`, rooted in the
`PathOfAngelsGuards` library: a plain `lake build` still runs the pin, and a stale fixture reds the
guard library instead of the archive.

⚠ Named residue: none.  Nothing in this module needs a fixture proof as data. -/
