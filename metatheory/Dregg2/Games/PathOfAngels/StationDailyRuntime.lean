# StationDailyRuntime — the READ boundary for the station's daily ritual

Substrate note: this is Lean-authored game semantics behind a canonical byte
wire.  Nothing here is an AIR, a constraint system or a gadget.  Rust carries
bytes to this module and back; it computes nothing.

PLATFORM-ROADMAP §7.3 pairs two rows, and both already exist and are proved:
`SalvageCrate` is the ritual and `ShipInstrumentPanel` is what the ritual moves.
Neither had an `@[export]`, so no reader could see either one.  This module is
that export, and it is deliberately a READ ONLY.

## ⚠ CORRECTED TWICE — and the second correction is the one that CLOSED the gap

This heading used to say the write path was "unreachable by type": that
`SalvageCrate.CurrentStateCapability` was `opaque` with no producer anywhere, so
no `@[export]` could ever reach `openCrate`.  **That was false at HEAD.**  The
capability is a sealed structure with a `private` constructor and two producers —
`SalvageCrate.genesis` (the one-time install) and the successor an ACCEPTED open
hands back — `StationCrateOpen` composes them with `ShipInstrumentPanel.observe`,
and `StationCrateOpenRuntime` exports the whole ceremony as
`dregg_poa_crate_open`.  A player can open the crate.

Then this module still served zeros, for a *second* and weaker reason: its
request carried no open history, so the read had nothing to fold.  Measured over
HTTP on 2026-08-07: the write path served `exact_total: 1, observed: 2` while
`/api/poa/station/…/panel` served `exact_total: 0, observed: 0`.  **That is what
this version fixes.**  `Request` now carries `history` — the node's durable open
log — and `servedStateOver` REPLAYS it.

What is still true, and is what keeps this wire receipt-free:

* `SalvageCrate.openCore` is `private`, so no module outside `SalvageCrate` can
  call it.
* `ShipInstrumentPanel.Receipt` has a private `mk` whose only producer is
  `ofSalvageOpen`, which consumes an accepted `SalvageCrate.OpenReceipt`.

That second point still decides this module's shape.  A wire that decoded JSON
into a `Receipt` would be a public constructor for the sealed type, and any
caller could then post a contribution the crate never authorized and move the
ship.  So **this wire carries no receipts** — it carries the LOG, and every
receipt is re-derived by replaying it through `SalvageCrate.openCrate` itself.

## ⚑ ONE FOLD, and it lives here because this is the module both halves import

`HistoryRow`, `priorOpens`, `envelopeOfRow`, `envelopesOfHistory` and `replayOver`
were authored in `StationCrateOpenRuntime` (the WRITE).  They are here now, and
the write ABBREVIATES them, because the alternative was a second fold: a read
that replayed the same log by its own arithmetic is two shapes that agree today
and disagree the first time either grows a field.  This module is the one both
runtimes import, so it is where the shared fold can live; the direction is the
same one that already collapsed `stationPanelRaw` into `StationCrateOpen.panelRaw`.

`the_served_ship_moves_when_the_log_records_an_opening` replaces
`the_served_ship_has_not_been_moved`, which was advertised as "the assertion that
goes RED the day a judged opening can be folded in" and did **not** go red when
that day came — because it was never about reachability, only about this request
type having no `history` field.  Its replacement is a PAIR over the same
deployment: an empty log serves zeros, and the one-row log an accepted open
leaves behind serves the moved ship.  Delete the fold and the second half reds.
`StationCrateOpenRuntime.the_station_read_serves_the_ship_this_write_published`
is the cross-module half: the document THIS read serves for the log the node
appends is bit-identical to the panel the WRITE published.

## ⚠ An unreplayable log is a REFUSAL, never a ship at zero

`readBytes?` is `none` — the `""` fail-closed sentinel — when the log does not
replay.  Serving `ShipInstrumentPanel.initial` there would render a corrupt or
foreign log as "nobody has opened the crate yet", which is exactly the reading a
player cannot distinguish from the truth.  `the_read_refuses_a_log_it_cannot_replay`
pins it.

## The two halves, and why one of them may be public at all

**The panel half is communal by construction.**  `ShipInstrumentPanel.State` has
no per-player field; `the_face_does_not_record_who_opened` proves two different
crew members drawing the same ticket leave identical faces.  The wire twin here
is `the_served_panel_does_not_depend_on_the_crew`: substituting *any* request
leaves every panel field of the served document bit-identical.  A reader
therefore reconstructs no attendance record, streak or leaderboard, because
there is no such state to reconstruct.

**The crate half is a VISIBLE ROTATION, not a hidden instance.**  `SalvageCrate`
is explicit that its mixer "is not an unpredictability source" and that the
beacon schedule is "curator-authored and visible", and `generatedRotation` hands
a player their whole rotation deliberately.  This module publishes exactly that
function of exactly that authored schedule
(`the_served_rotation_is_the_crate_rotation`,
`the_served_beacons_are_the_authored_schedule`).

⚠ The three arcade games' hidden instances live behind `HiddenInstance` /
`SlotDeriveRuntime`, and **this module's import cone contains neither**.  The
containment is structural rather than a filter: there is no run seed, slot
secret, commitment or target anywhere in the reply type, because the types that
carry them are not in scope.

⚠ And the standing condition the panel's own docblock names is carried forward
here unchanged: the visible rotation is fine *only because* the panel is
communal and unattributed.  **If anything attributable is ever hung off this
panel, this route stops being safe** and the rotation must leave it.

## The authored station

The crate is `SalvageCrateExamples.config` — already authored, already proved
valid, and its docblock already names "the web/game layer" as its consumer.  It
is reused rather than re-typed.

⚑ The panel is `StationCrateOpen.panel`, not a second one.  This module used to
author its own `stationPanelRaw` with the same fields, and `StationCrateOpen`
authored an identical one for the write path — two shapes that agreed today and
would have disagreed the first time either grew a dial.  There is now ONE panel
deployment and both halves abbreviate it.  It carries exactly one dial, because
`the_authored_table_moves_only_supplies` shows every row of the authored table
leaves intel, cohesion, influence and score at zero — a second dial would be one
that provably cannot move, which is decoration.  The panel's identity is read
off the crate's mission rather than re-typed, and
`the_panel_and_the_crate_are_one_deployment` proves the two agree, so a receipt
from this crate could never be refused by this panel as foreign.

⚠ The station content is Lean-authored, not installed by a genesis ceremony —
there is no station genesis and no activated-content component for it.  The
served `federation_id` is therefore the *authored* one and need not be the
node's.  The Rust route reports the node's own federation beside it rather than
implying they match.

## The wire

Request (`POA-STATION-DAILY-1`), key order pinned by `Request.toJson`:

    {"format":"POA-STATION-DAILY-1","crew":null,"history":[]}
    {"format":"POA-STATION-DAILY-1","crew":"<64 lowercase hex>",
     "history":[{"player":"<64 lowercase hex>","period":n},…]}

⚠ `history` is the node's DURABLE OPEN LOG, spelled exactly as the crate-open
wire spells it (`HistoryRow.toJson` is the same function).  It is not a value a
browser authors: the node reads it out of its own store.  A caller who edits a
row edits the log, and the log then fails to replay — `readBytes?` returns the
`""` refusal rather than a shorter or re-dated history.

Reply (`POA-STATION-DAILY-OUT-1`):

    {"format":"POA-STATION-DAILY-OUT-1",
     "federation_id":"<hex>","content_session":"<hex>","content_epoch":n,
     "gauges":[{"gauge":n,"meter":"supplies","exact_total":n,"full_at":n,
                "shown":n,"at_full":false}],
     "recovered_kinds":n,"observed":n,"admitted":n,
     "opens_at":n,"closes_at":n,"table_rows":n,"ticket_count":n,
     "crew":null | {"key":"<hex>","eligible":bool,
                    "rotation":[{"period":n,"beacon":"<hex>",
                                 "entry":null|{"id":n,"prize":"…","supplies":n}}]}}

Acceptance is `NetworkJudgeWire.canonicalDecode` — the same seal
`decodeSignalInput` and `dregg_poa_signal_slot_derive` use, imported rather than
re-typed.  An unknown field, a missing field, a transposed key, an uppercase hex
digit, a trailing byte or a re-spelled integer all fail the re-encode comparison
and the export returns `""`.

`exact_total` is the unclipped arithmetic and `shown` is the needle; both are
published so the display scale can never quietly become the bound.

every `OpenResult` the replay produces is consumed by the fold and dropped, no
row is appended (only `node/src/poa_crate_api.rs` appends, and only on an
accepted open), and the caller gets a projection.  Handing it a log it did not
earn buys nothing: a row the crate would not have accepted in that position makes
the whole replay `none`, and the reply is the `""` refusal.

EVERY deployment and EVERY state — so a reader learns nothing about who opened
the crate, because the document does not depend on it.  This is the reason the
route may be unauthenticated. -/

/-! ## THE GATE, RE-STATED SO IT CAN FIRE

⚠ `the_served_ship_has_not_been_moved` is RETIRED, not renamed.  It asserted one
dial at zero with nothing observed or admitted, and its docblock called it "the
assertion that goes RED the day a judged opening can be folded in".  That day
came on 2026-08-07 and it stayed GREEN, because it was never a claim about
reachability: `Request` had no `history` field, so `servedState` was
`ShipInstrumentPanel.initial` **by construction** and no amount of judged
openings could have moved it.  A gate whose subject is a definitional identity
cannot fire.

What replaces it is a PAIR over one deployment, whose two halves differ in
exactly one log row.  The second half is the one that could not previously be
written down, and it is red the moment the fold is removed. -/

the row `node/src/poa_crate_api.rs` appends, spelled exactly as it stores it. -/
def theLogAfterOneOpen : List HistoryRow :=
  [{ player := StationCrateOpen.crew41, period := 31 }]

/-- The mutation is present before any reading is taken: the two logs below
really do differ by exactly one row, and it names the crew key and the installed
period.  Without this the pair could be two spellings of the empty log. -/

/-! ## Executable fixture and hostile paths -/

/-! ### Hostile wires, each refused -/

/-! ## The pins, split honestly

Everything about the PROJECTION and the SEAL is kernel-clean and gets the strong
pin.  Everything about the STATION's particular authored content inherits that
content's `configValidB`/`panelValidB` compiled evaluation — which is a
compiled-evaluator fact and is labelled as one, exactly as `SlotDeriveRuntime`
splits its sponge theorems.

⚑ **THE FIXTURE PINS NO LONGER EVALUATE IN THIS MODULE (2026-08-08).**  This module is in
the `Dregg2.FFI` closure — the crypto archive's build — and a `native_decide` here made
every game-fixture regression a hard failure of every Rust proving target.  Every fixture
theorem above is now an evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definition; the EVALUATION — each
`check_* = true`, pinned by `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` — lives in
`StationDailyRuntimeFixtures.lean`, rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library.  A plain
`lake build` still runs every pin; `lake build Dregg2.FFI` never does.  This module keeps
NO `native_decide` residue: its panel proof is `StationCrateOpen.panel_valid`, cited by
name, and the general seal/projection laws stay kernel-clean below. -/
