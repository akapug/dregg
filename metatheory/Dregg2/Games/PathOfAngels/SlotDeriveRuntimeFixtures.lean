# Slot-derive runtime — the fixture-pin EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`SlotDeriveRuntime.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build
root), and until 2026-08-08 its thirteen fixture pins ran `native_decide` at elaboration —
each one a Poseidon2 sponge evaluation — so any derivation-fixture regression was a hard
failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace (the compilation-unit coupling the
stale-fixture outage measured). The pins' STATEMENTS remain in `SlotDeriveRuntime.lean` as
evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions; THIS module is where they are RUN. It is
rooted in the `PathOfAngelsGuards` library and reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Each theorem keeps the name the in-module `#assert_compiled` census used, so the
fully-qualified names are unchanged.

Named residue in the parent: NONE — no construction there demands a proof as data.

/-! ## The laboratory, moved out of the runtime module (#86)

These definitions were compiled into the `Dregg2.FFI` closure, and Lean computes every compiled
no-argument `def` when its module initializes: each `check_*` and fixture here ran on every node
boot. They live beside the pins that evaluate them now; nothing linked into the node reaches them. -/
