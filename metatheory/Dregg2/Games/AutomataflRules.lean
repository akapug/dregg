# AutomataflRules — the automatafl spec REWRITTEN AGAINST THE RULESET

⚑ SUBSTRATE. This is a **Lean-authored game spec**. Nothing here is a Rust AIR, and the
AIR/gadget layer over it stays Lean-authored (`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.Automatafl*`). The
existing hand-written Rust in `dregg-automatafl/` is DEBT and is not extended by this file.

## Why this file exists

`Dregg2.Games.Automatafl` was written by mirroring `logic/src/game.rs::apply_moves` and was
guarded by a differential test pointed at a second copy of the same code. The audit
(`docs/reference/AUTOMATAFL-RULES-CONFORMANCE-AUDIT.md`) read it against the Creator-Approved
ruleset and found nine divergences — six outcome-changing, three that DESTROY PIECES, the
smallest firing with one move on a 3x3 board. This file is the rules-faithful replacement.

**Ground truth**, in precedence order:

1. `~/dev/automatafl/logic/README.md` §"Game Rules" — the Creator-Approved ruleset.
2. `~/dev/automatafl/old_python_prototype/model.py` — the ACTUAL GAME per the author
   (`Game.ev_Move` / `Resolve` / `CompleteMoves` / `ClearState`, `Board.CanMove` / `Move` /
   `AgentStep`).
3. `logic/MOVE_EXPLAIN.md`, `logic/PHILOSOPHY.md` for intent.
4. `logic/src/*.rs` as corroboration only.

## The author's four rulings, implemented here

* **(A) Conflict re-entry is modelled in full.** `Board → List Move → Board` is the WRONG
  TYPE for a turn. A turn is N ROUNDS (§7): submit → detect → on conflict the involved
  players' moves are dropped and THEY re-enter, every non-conflicted player is LOCKED, the
  conflicted COORDINATE is MARKED and becomes illegal as source AND destination FOR ALL, and
  the round recurses. Only a clean round resolves; then the automaton steps; then the win is
  checked. Markers, locks and pending moves die at turn end (`model.py::ClearState`).
* **(B) The column rule is SELECTABLE** (`GameConfig.tieBreak`, §5): `Column` (default,
  = `automaton.rs`, prefers the Y axis) | `Row` (= `model.py::AgentStep`, prefers X) |
  `Freeze` (no move on an equal-priority tie). See §5 for why the two implementations'
  disagreement is only apparent.
* **(C) 2-cycles STAY PUT** (§4), the README's empty-square-back-to-a-source case stays put,
  and empty cycles cannot capture a piece.
* **(D) The automaton square is banned as a move SOURCE ONLY** (§2). Naming it as a
  DESTINATION is legal to propose and simply FAILS to execute — the square is occupied, so
  the inclusive path check (§4) blocks the move and the piece is replaced at its origin.

## What else changed vs. `Automatafl.lean`

* **3.2, the worst one.** The path check is INCLUSIVE OF THE DESTINATION
  (`model.py::CanMove` scans `range(min, max+1)` on both coordinates, exempting sources via
  `PC_F_PASSABLE`). A non-moving piece standing on the destination BLOCKS, and the mover is
  replaced at its origin. The old `interior`-only check let the mover overwrite it.
* **3.7, determinism.** `journeys.find?` awarded a shared landing square by MOVE-LIST ORDER
  and deleted the loser. Here a contested landing is a **CONFLICT** (§3, `unresolved`) —
  the `DetectAndConflict` reading of "the conflict rules are the weakest precondition that
  structurally ensures that following move resolution has a deterministic result". Resolution
  only runs on a round whose landings are uniquely claimed, so `resolve_perm` is a THEOREM.
* **Setup and win** (§6) existed only in hand-written Rust. Two-player = two corners in the
  same row each; four-player = one corner each; and the win fires on the automaton **moving
  into** a corner, not sitting on one.

## What was KEPT because it conforms

The identical-move exception, the caterpillar erratum (a piece landing on another move's
source participates in that move too; cycles permissible), >2-cycle rotation, and THE ENTIRE
AUTOMATON — all four priorities, both equidistant-removals, all empty-space guards. §5 reuses
`evaluateAxis` / `decisionCmp` / `Decision.delta` / `stepTo` from `Automatafl.lean`
UNCHANGED; only the equal-priority tie-break is rewired to `GameConfig`.

## The two keystones

* `resolve_conserves` (§8) — **UNCONDITIONAL** piece conservation: a bijection between the
  occupied squares before and after resolution. The old `applyMoves_conserves_pieces` had to
  assume `hlandA`/`hlandB` ("neither target square holds a piece that is not one of the two
  movers") — that assumption WAS rules clause 3.2, and implementing 3.2 discharges it.
* `resolve_perm` (§9) — **PROVEN** permutation-invariance. The old `FairnessObligation` was
  not merely unproven, it was FALSE (audit D5); this is the theorem it should have been.

/-! ## §2  Move legality

README, Move Entry Phase: a move is two coordinates, source ≠ destination, sharing an axis
(a rook move on an empty board), both in bounds. Plus:

* **(D)** `model.py::ev_Move` rejects `POS_CANT_MOVE_THAT` when the SOURCE is the agent, and
  says nothing about the destination. A move TARGETING the automaton is proposable and simply
  fails at resolution (`CanMove` finds a non-empty, non-passable square). `game.rs` bans both
  endpoints; the prototype and the README are the authority, so only the source is banned.
* The conflicted-coordinate clause is LIVE here: `marks` comes from the enclosing
  `RoundState` (§7), so it is genuinely set during a turn. (In `Automatafl.lean` the twin
  clause read `Board.conflictAt`, which was never set true anywhere in the tree.) -/

/-- Move legality against a board and the round's conflict markers. -/
def MoveLegal (b : Board) (marks : List Coord) (m : Move) : Prop :=
  m.frm ≠ m.to
  ∧ (m.frm.x = m.to.x ∨ m.frm.y = m.to.y)

/-! ## §3  Conflicts

README: *"a conflict occurs if multiple players specify the same source; or multiple players
specify the same destination with a non-vacuum source. Except two players specifying an
identical (same sources, same targets) move is not a conflict."*

Both detectors compare a PAIR of moves and require the pair to differ in the field that is
not shared — so an identical `(src,dst)` submitted twice can never fire either one. That is
the exception, by construction (and it is `model.py`'s `if pending_move in seen_moves:
continue`, expressed without an order-dependent `seen` set).

The third clause, `unresolved` (§4), is the merge/confluence conflict. -/

/-- Fork: ≥2 moves out of `s` to different destinations. -/
def forkAt (ms : List Move) (s : Coord) : Bool :=
  ms.any (fun m₁ => ms.any (fun m₂ => m₁.frm == s && m₂.frm == s && m₁.to != m₂.to))

/-- Collision: ≥2 moves into `d` from different NON-VACUUM sources. -/
def collideAt (b : Board) (ms : List Move) (d : Coord) : Bool :=
  ms.any (fun m₁ => ms.any (fun m₂ =>
    m₁.to == d && m₂.to == d && m₁.frm != m₂.frm
      && !(b.cellAt m₁.frm).isVacuum && !(b.cellAt m₂.frm).isVacuum))

/-- Every coordinate any move names — the only places a fork/collide can live. -/
def candidates (ms : List Move) : List Coord := (ms.map (·.frm)) ++ (ms.map (·.to))

/-- The fork/collide conflicted coordinates. -/
def clashCoords (b : Board) (ms : List Move) : List Coord :=
  ((candidates ms).filter (fun c => forkAt ms c || collideAt b ms c)).dedup

/-! ## §4  Resolution

Rules step 3, and `model.py::CompleteMoves` — which fires a move exactly when its source is
occupied, its destination is empty, and `CanMove` finds the INCLUSIVE rectangle clear of
non-passable pieces (all sources are `PC_F_PASSABLE`). That loop is order-dependent; the
conflict clauses exist precisely to make the order not matter, and §9 proves it here.

The order-free rendering: the non-blocked moves form a graph with out-degree ≤ 1 on sources
(a fork is a conflict), so each piece has a forward orbit. A piece advances along its orbit
to the first square strictly ahead that either carries a piece at turn start (the caterpillar
— that piece consumed the edge out of its own square, so we stop there) or dead-ends. It
advances only if that square actually empties. -/

/-- The straight-line path INCLUSIVE OF THE DESTINATION (`model.py::CanMove` scans
`range(min, max+1)` on both coordinates). This is the fix for audit divergence 3.2. -/
def pathCells (frm dst : Coord) : List Coord := interior frm dst ++ [dst]

/-- A move is blocked iff some cell on its path — DESTINATION INCLUDED — holds a piece that
is not itself a moving source. Sources are passable "in the process of being moved"
(`mark_passable`, `PC_F_PASSABLE`) whether or not their own move ends up executing.

A blocked move contributes NO EDGE, so its piece is replaced at its origin: the author's
*"designating a move to an occupied square is fine, it just fails to execute, it doesn't
generate a conflict and shouldn't."* -/
def blockedB (b : Board) (ms : List Move) (m : Move) : Bool :=
  (pathCells m.frm m.to).any
    (fun c => !(b.cellAt c).isVacuum && !(ms.any (fun m' => m'.frm == c)))

/-- "All these are the same coordinate" — `none` on an empty list AND on a fork. Written so
it depends on the list only through its MEMBERS (`allEqOpt_spec`), which is what makes the
whole resolution permutation-invariant (§9). -/
def allEqOpt (l : List Coord) : Option Coord :=
  match l.head? with
  | none   => none
  | some d => if l.all (fun e => e == d) then some d else none

/-- The move graph: the unique unblocked destination out of `c`, if there is one. -/
def edgeOf (b : Board) (ms : List Move) (c : Coord) : Option Coord :=
  allEqOpt ((ms.filter (fun m => m.frm == c && !blockedB b ms m)).map (·.to))

/-- Does `c` carry a piece at turn start? (The automaton counts — it occludes, it is never a
source, and no move may land on it.) -/
def carAt (b : Board) (c : Coord) : Bool := !(b.cellAt c).isVacuum

/-- `c`'s move goes to a square whose move comes straight back — a 2-cycle.
PHILOSOPHY.md: *"2-cycles (A→B, B→A): **Always** stay in place — unambiguous composition"*;
MERGE_RESOLUTION_DESIGN "Fixed behavior (not configurable)"; `game.rs` `is_two_cycle ⇒
dest_coord = start_coord`. `Automatafl.lean` SWAPPED them, which is audit divergence 3.5a,
and it also covers the README's own named case — *"a move from an empty square directly back
to some source square — the piece simply doesn't move"* (3.5b): there the far square is
vacuum, and the pair is still a 2-cycle. -/
def twoCyc (E : Coord → Option Coord) (c : Coord) : Bool :=
  match E c with
  | none   => false
  | some d => (E d == some c) && (d != c)

/-- Walk forward from `c`: the square a piece leaving `c` would come to rest on — the first
square STRICTLY AHEAD that carries a piece at turn start, or the first dead end.
`none` = the walk never terminates, i.e. it entered a cycle of squares that were ALL empty at
turn start; MOVE_EXPLAIN §4 *"An empty cycle cannot 'pull' a new piece into it. The move is
nullified"* (audit divergence 3.5c). -/
def stopWalk (E : Coord → Option Coord) (car : Coord → Bool) : Nat → Coord → Option Coord

  | f + 1, c =>
    match E c with
    | none   => some c
    | some d => if car d then some d else stopWalk E car f d

/-- Does the piece standing on `c` leave its square? It does not if `c` is in a 2-cycle, if
its walk enters an empty cycle, if its walk returns to `c` itself, or if the square it would
come to rest on is held by a piece that does not itself leave (recursively — that is the
author's "fails to execute", propagated back down the chain).

Running out of `vf` means the chain of "waiting on the piece ahead" is longer than the number
of moves, i.e. it is a rotation cycle, and on a cycle every edge fires. -/

   ORDER, and DELETED the loser. Here it is a conflict.
2. the landing square holds a piece that does not itself leave. `leaves` is written to
   prevent this; the check is kept so that resolution can never be reached in a state where a
   piece would be overwritten. It is a CHECKED side condition, not a proven property of
   `leaves` — a labelled residual, and its failure mode is a conflict, never a lost piece.
3. the landing is off the board. Unreachable through `roundStep` (which filters for
   legality); kept for the same reason. -/

/-- **Resolution.** Rules step 3, in full. Guarded by `resolvableB`, which `roundStep` also

/-! ## §5  The automaton step — UNCHANGED, with the tie-break wired to `GameConfig`

`evaluateAxis`'s nine-case table, its four empty-space guards, its two equidistant-removals
and its distance tie-break order were checked clause-by-clause against README Priorities 1–4
and conform on every one. They are reused here verbatim from `Dregg2.Games.Automatafl`; the
ONLY change is the equal-priority branch.

Note the `(repulsor, repulsor)` arm's empty-space guard is IMPLIED, not missing: distances are
≥ 1, so `pos.dist ≠ neg.dist` forces `max ≥ 2` and the flight direction has room. Do not
"fix" it into a bug.

**On the two implementations disagreeing about which axis is "the column".** `automaton.rs`
breaks equal-priority ties along Y; `model.py::AgentStep` breaks them along X. They are the
same game: `model.py`'s `DEFAULT_SETUP` is indexed `[x][y]` and `board.rs`'s `arr2` is indexed
`[y][x]` (`Coord::ix` = `(y, x)`), so the two stock boards are TRANSPOSES of each other, and
transposing swaps the axes. The author has ruled the preference selectable with `Column`
(= Y, `automaton.rs`) as the default, and §6's `stockTwoPlayer` uses the `board.rs`
orientation to match. -/

the transpose discussed in §5; the `board.rs` orientation is used, so the default `Column`

/-! ## §7  THE ROUND — the honest type of a turn

`applyTurn : Board → List Move → Board` cannot express the rules. Per (A):

> In the event of a conflict, all players involved in the conflict must invalidate their
> previous move and prepare another move. It is illegal to specify as a source or destination
> the *exact* coordinate which was conflicted upon … this is often indicated with a temporary
> marker … After all involved players have prepared their respective moves, they are revealed
> simultaneously, and, if needed, the conflict resolution will recurse.

So a turn is a sequence of ROUNDS over a `RoundState`: the board (frozen for the whole turn —
nothing resolves until a clean round), the accumulated markers, the LOCKED moves that stand,
and the seats that must re-enter. `roundStep` is one round; `runTurn` folds a trace of
submissions. `ClearState` is structural: a fresh `RoundState` per turn carries no markers, no
locks and no pending moves. -/

/-- The mid-turn state. `board` is the TURN-START board; rounds never mutate it. -/
structure RoundState where
  board   : Board
  marks   : List Coord
  locked  : List Move
  waiting : List Pid

/-- The turn's opening round state. -/
def openRound (b : Board) (seats : List Pid) : RoundState :=
  { board := b, marks := [], locked := [], waiting := seats }

/-- A round either demands re-entry, or resolves the turn. -/
inductive RoundOutcome
  | again (rs : RoundState)
  | resolved (b : Board) (win : Option Pid)

/-- **ONE ROUND.**

1. Take the submissions from the seats that owe a move, keeping only the legal ones (a
   marked coordinate is illegal as source AND destination, for everyone — §2).
2. Add the locked moves. Detect fork/collide conflicts; if none, detect merge conflicts (§4).
3. Any conflicted coordinate is MARKED, every move naming it at EITHER endpoint is dropped
   and its seat re-enters, and every other move is LOCKED. The round recurses.
   (`Automatafl.lean`'s `conflictResolve` dropped a move only if *its own* source was
   fork-conflicted or *its own* destination collide-conflicted — a move merely MENTIONING a
   conflicted coordinate at the other endpoint survived and executed. Audit divergences
   2.4c / D4a / D4b.)
4. A clean round RESOLVES: markers are cleared (they live in `RoundState`, so this is
   structural), moves resolve, the automaton steps, the win is checked on ENTRY.

One deviation from `model.py`, in the README's favour: a previously-locked seat whose move is
newly conflicted re-enters. `model.py` deletes its pending move but never removes it from
`self.locked`, so it can no longer submit — a deadlock the README's "all players involved …
must prepare another move" does not permit. -/
def roundStep (cfg : GameConfig) (g : GoalAssignment) (rs : RoundState) (subs : List Move) :

/-! ## §8  ⚑ PIECE CONSERVATION — UNCONDITIONAL

Every piece on the board at turn start is on the board after resolution, exactly once, and
nothing appears from nowhere: `φ` is a bijection between the occupied squares.

No hypotheses. `Automatafl.lean`'s `applyMoves_conserves_pieces` carried `hlandA`/`hlandB`
("neither target square holds a piece that is not one of the two movers") and was stated only
at arity 2. Those hypotheses WERE rules clause 3.2; `blockedB`'s inclusive path check
discharges them, and the guard `resolvableB` — which is `roundStep`'s own conflict test —
supplies uniqueness of arrivals. -/

/-! ## §9  ⚑ DETERMINISM — permutation-invariance, PROVEN

PHILOSOPHY.md, Principle of Fairness: *"The success and order of moves should be independent
of any ordering on players or intrinsic ordering on the moves."*

`Automatafl.lean` stated this as `FairnessObligation` and it was **false** — audit D5 permutes
four moves and gets a different board. Here it is a theorem, and the reason it is provable is
structural: every primitive below reads the move list only through membership
(`List.any`, `List.filter`, `List.map`, `List.dedup`, `List.length`), and the one place that
could have been order-sensitive — who wins a shared landing square — is a CONFLICT, so
resolution never runs there. -/
