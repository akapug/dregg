# Dregg2.Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone — T5: finalized-prefix monotonicity for `tauOrder`,
# proved WHERE IT IS TRUE and REFUTED where the node assumed it unconditionally.

**The claim (CONSENSUS-FLEX §4 T5).** As the lace grows (new blocks arriving through the
verified `insert`), the finalized order computed by the node's rule
(`blocklace/src/ordering.rs::tau`, modeled executably as
`Distributed.BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`) only EXTENDS: previously-finalized blocks keep
their positions — no rollback, no reorder of the finalized region. The live node RELIES on
this: `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::poll_finalized_blocks` keeps a bare INDEX
(`executed_up_to`), slices `ordered[executed_up_to..]` each poll, and advances the index —
sound iff the already-executed prefix of `ordered` is bit-identical across polls.

**THE FINDING — the unconditional claim is FALSE, by an HONEST counterexample.** The
`BlocklaceFinality.lean` header claimed `finalized_prefix_monotone` with no theorem in the
tree; the proof attempt refutes the unconditional statement. A wave's segment is its
leader's COVERAGE (union of causal pasts of the wave-END blocks that ratify it,
`leaderCoverage`) and coverage is NOT closed under lace growth: a wave-end block arriving
LATE and ratifying an ALREADY-FINAL leader grows that wave's coverage, and the new blocks
`xsort` into the MIDDLE of the already-executed region. No Byzantine behavior is needed —
the counterexample below (`lagBase → lagGrown`) is a 4-validator run where validator 4
merely LAGS one wave: its round-2/round-3 blocks (41, 42) pass every check of the verified
`insert` (signed, preds present, seq monotone, no equivocation by ANYONE), yet

  `tauOrder lagBase   = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,12,22,32]`            (executed_up_to → 10)
  `tauOrder lagGrown  = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,41,12,22,32,42]`      (41 lands at index 7)

so the old order is NOT a prefix of the new one. **Node implication** (the `#guard`s below
pin it): at the next poll the node slices `ordered[10..] = [32, 42]` — block 32 is
RE-EXECUTED (it was index 9 of the old order) and block 41, a finalized honest turn, falls
BEHIND the cursor and is NEVER EXECUTED (the index only advances; the FinalityGate admits
by `(creator, seq)` MEMBERSHIP, not position, so it does not catch this). The wavelength-3
discipline and honest supermajority do NOT exclude the trace; nothing
`blocklace_sync.rs` checks implies the needed stability. The deployed code does NOT sit
inside the true theorem — that is the soundness finding this module reports.

**What IS true (the corrected T5, proved below).** Prefix monotonicity holds exactly when
the finalized region is STABLE under the growth — `FinalizedRegionStable B B' P wl`:
  (1) `leaders_extend` — the final-leader sequence of `B` is a prefix of that of `B'`
      (no already-anchored wave is forfeited, no earlier skipped wave anchors late); and
  (2) `fold_agrees` — replaying the OLD leaders' segment computation in the GROWN lace
      reproduces the same segments and coverages (no late ratifier grew an old wave's
      coverage; the pointwise sufficient condition is `fold_agrees_of_pointwise`).
Under that hypothesis `tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` gives `tauOrder B P wl <+:
tauOrder B' P wl`, and `tau_executed_prefix_fixed` is the node-shaped corollary: the first
`(tauOrder B).length` entries — the executed region — are bit-identical, which is precisely
what index slicing needs. The hypothesis is NAMED as the node's missing check: a node that
verified `stableCheck` (the executable `Bool` mirror, below) before advancing
`executed_up_to` — or diffed the recomputed prefix against the executed one — would sit
inside the theorem. Today it does not.

**Why the conditional shape (not a synchrony assumption).** The natural primitive
hypothesis "every new block's round exceeds the finalized region's wave-end" implies
`FinalizedRegionStable`, but it is a TIMELINESS assumption the node neither checks nor can
check locally; stating T5 with it would smuggle synchrony in as if deployed code enforced
it. `FinalizedRegionStable` is the exact boundary: it is what the growth must preserve, it
is executable (`stableCheck`), and the counterexample witnesses its failure mode.

Non-vacuity (the sanctioned `#guard` teeth for these `qsort`-laden executable defs —
kernel reduction of `Array.qsort` is impractical and `native_decide` is banned, exactly as
in `BlocklaceFinality` §9):
  * POSITIVE — `trace6` (the 3-node `trace3` grown by a full second wave, rounds 4–6):
    `stableCheck` holds, the order extends 9 → 18, the old order IS a prefix.
  * NEGATIVE — `lagBase → lagGrown`: insert-valid, equivocation-free, yet NOT a prefix;
    `stableCheck` is `false` and the failing field is coverage growth (`leaders_extend`
    still holds — the guards isolate the mechanism).

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); NO `sorry`/`:=True`.

/-! ## 1. The stability hypothesis — what lace growth must preserve for no-rollback. -/

/-- **`FinalizedRegionStable B B' P wl`** — the finalized region of `B` is undisturbed by
the growth to `B'`:

* `leaders_extend` — `B'`'s final-leader sequence extends `B`'s (no anchored wave is
  forfeited by a late leader-slot equivocation; no earlier skipped wave anchors late and
  splices a segment mid-order);
* `fold_agrees` — replaying the OLD leaders through `B'`'s segment computation
  (`tauStep B'`) reproduces the `B` fold exactly: same emitted segments AND same coverage
  sets (no late wave-end ratifier grew an old wave's coverage).

This is the exact boundary of T5: `tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` proves it SUFFICIENT,
and `lagBase → lagGrown` (§4) witnesses that dropping `fold_agrees` admits an honest,
insert-valid reorder. The node currently checks NEITHER field (the finding). -/

/-- **`tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` (T5, corrected).** If the growth `B → B'` leaves the
finalized region stable (`FinalizedRegionStable`), the computed finalized order only
extends: `tauOrder B P wl` is a prefix of `tauOrder B' P wl` — previously-finalized blocks
keep their positions; no rollback, no reorder. This is the property the node's
`executed_up_to` slicing needs, with its true hypothesis made explicit (and, per §4,
NOT dischargeable from what the node currently checks). -/

  rw [← hT, List.foldl_append, hrest, h.fold_agrees]

/-- **`tau_executed_prefix_fixed`** — the node-shaped corollary: under stability, the
first `(tauOrder B).length` entries of the grown order — the region `executed_up_to`
indexes into — are EXACTLY the old order. Index-based slicing is sound precisely here. -/

/-! ## 4. THE COUNTEREXAMPLE — an honest laggard breaks the unconditional claim.

Four validators `[1,2,3,4]` (supermajority = 3), wavelength 3. Validator 4 publishes its
genesis block 40, then LAGS (a partition, a slow link — pure asynchrony, no fault).
Validators 1–3 proceed: rounds 2 and 3 complete without 4, wave 0's leader (validator 1's
genesis, block 10) is super-ratified by wave-end blocks {12, 22, 32} — three distinct
ratifying creators ≥ 3 — and the run finalizes all 10 blocks. THEN validator 4 catches up:
its round-2 block 41 and round-3 block 42 arrive, both passing every verified-insert check
(signed, preds present, seq strictly monotone 0 < 1 < 2, NO equivocation by anyone). Block
42 sits at wave 0's END round and RATIFIES leader 10, so wave 0's coverage grows by
{41, 42}; `xsortBy` places 41 (round 2) BEFORE the round-3 blocks the node already
executed. The old order is not a prefix of the new one — `stableCheck` fails on
`fold_agrees` while `leaders_extend` still holds (the guards isolate the mechanism). -/

/-- Round 1 (genesis): all four validators. -/

`(creator, seq)` equivocation arm). Certifies the counterexample needs NO Byzantine step
and no fail-open path — the verified reception accepts it. -/

/-! ## 5. NON-VACUITY (positive) — a real growth that IS stable, verified end to end.

`trace3` (the 3-node, 3-round lace of `BlocklaceFinality` §9, wave 0 finalized) grows by a
FULL second wave (rounds 4–6, fully connected): wave 1's round-robin leader (validator 2's
round-4 block 23) is super-ratified at round 6, its segment — the nine new blocks — is
APPENDED, and nothing touches wave 0's coverage (the late blocks all sit at rounds > 3).
`stableCheck` holds, so by `FinalizedRegionStable.of_check` +
`tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` the 9-block order is a prefix of the 18-block order — and
the `#guard`s witness it executably. The hypothesis is satisfiable by real growth and the
theorem's conclusion is non-trivial: T5 is not vacuous. -/

/-! The `#guard`s are the sanctioned executable teeth (a false one is a BUILD ERROR;
`Array.qsort` is impractical for kernel reduction and `native_decide` is banned — same
regime as `BlocklaceFinality` §9). Together: the POSITIVE instance shows a real,
insert-valid growth satisfying `FinalizedRegionStable` with a strictly longer order
(hypothesis satisfiable, conclusion non-trivial); the NEGATIVE instance shows an
insert-valid, equivocation-free growth where the conclusion FAILS — so the hypothesis is
load-bearing and the unconditional T5 the node assumed is REFUTED, with the failing field
isolated (`fold_agrees`, coverage growth) and the node-side damage pinned (block 41
skipped forever, block 32 re-served). -/
