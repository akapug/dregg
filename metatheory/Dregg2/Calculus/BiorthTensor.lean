# Dregg2.Calculus.BiorthTensor — the TENSOR test: is the bridge load-bearing? (S3 linear + S4 grading.)

`Dregg2/Calculus/Biorthogonality.lean` proved the literal/order families are behaviours — but those
are RECTANGLES (point-tests), closed under almost any orthogonality. `docs/TRANSCENDENTAL-SYNTAX-
BRIDGE.md` (STATUS) names the two questions that decide whether the bridge is LOAD-BEARING or
decorative. This module answers both.

## TARGET 1 — THE TENSOR / LINEARITY. VERDICT: **CONDITIONAL YES, with the boundary made exact.**

The tensor lives over a COMPOSITE universe (stella `mll.rs` §69.35–36: `A ⊗ B = (A ⊙ B)^⊥⊥`, the
biorthogonal of the pairwise-union pre-tensor — NOT `(A^⊥ ∪ B^⊥)^⊥` over one universe, which is the
additive `&` by the landed `coOrth_union`; `orth_union_is_with` pins that distinction). A composite
move is a PAIR of guarded writes (debit at src, credit at dst — the `move` verb,
`VerbCompression.moveStep`); conservation is `Σδ = 0` across the pair (`move_conserves` /
`reachable_total_zero`).

  * **THE OBSTRUCTION (fully general).** Over ANY per-component test family — any test type `R`,
    any relation in which each test's verdict on a mixed pair follows componentwise
    (`Rectangular`) — every biorthogonal is mix-closed (`rect_mix_in_biorth`, one generic line),
    and conservation is NOT mix-closed: `(δ−1,δ+1)` and `(δ−2,δ+2)` both conserve but the mix
    `(δ−1,δ+2)` does not. So `conservation_not_behaviour_rectangular`: NO rectangular
    orthogonality, however rich its atoms, can carve the resource law. Componentwise testing is
    structurally blind to CORRELATION — that is precisely what biorthogonality misses about
    resources when its tests are per-turn. (Instantiated at the LIVE gate:
    `conservation_not_behaviour_live_pairs`, pairs of `SlotCaveat` tests.)
  * **THE RECOVERY.** Field the deployed pair-observable as a test — the `Σδ` comparator, exactly
    the `valTotal` observable `move_conserves` is stated in — and conservation IS an orthogonal,
    hence a behaviour: `conservation_is_behaviour` (`Cons = {Σδ ≥ 0, Σδ ≤ 0}^⊥ = Cons^⊥⊥`).
    Moreover conservation is EXACTLY the biorthogonal closure of the matched-delta pre-tensors
    (`conservation_eq_closure_of_matched_tensors`: `Cons = (⋃ₖ Δₖ ⊙ Δ₋ₖ)^⊥⊥`), and each matched
    tensor `Δₖ ⊗ Δ₋ₖ` lands inside it (`matched_tensor_subset_conservation`) — the linear face,
    decomposed through `⊗`. Non-vacuity both polarities: `conservation_proper` (a member, a
    non-member, the closure), and `pair_closure_grows` (a two-element conserving candidate whose
    closure STRICTLY grows — by re-pairing matched deltas — so the closure does real work here too).
  * **THE HEADLINE** (`linearity_recovered_from_orthogonality`): linearity is recovered from
    orthogonality IFF the test side may CORRELATE the components. The refutation of
    non-conservation is itself a relational (sum-reading) witness; rectangles can never field it.
    This is `.docs-history-noclaude/EPISTEMIC-DATALOG.md`'s fact/fiction line made formal: the resource law lies
    OUTSIDE every per-turn (rectangular) testing fragment and INSIDE the composite-test fragment,
    with the deployed `valTotal` observable as the one test that crosses the line.

## TARGET 2 — DOES THE COORDINATION GRADING EMERGE? VERDICT: **PARTIAL — and the conjectured
form REFUTED.**

  * **The conjectured shape is the WRONG one.** "Coordination-free ⟺ behaviour closed under
    DIRECTED union" (the CALM/Scott shape) FAILS in dregg's deployed lattices: every nonempty
    directed subset of `Budget` with a LUB ATTAINS it (`budget_directed_lub_attained` — bounded
    ℕ-valued coordinates), so directed-lub-closure holds VACUOUSLY for every subset
    (`directedLubClosed_vacuous`) — including the admission set of the bounded `budgetGuard`,
    which FORCES ORDERING (`directed_conjecture_refuted`). Directedness models one growing view;
    coordination cost is about DIVERGENT (incomparable) replicas. The two notions split exactly
    there.
  * **What the tier actually IS, structurally**: closure under PAIRWISE joins of (possibly
    incomparable) members — `free_iff_joinClosed`, definitionally `IConfluent`. The tier is a
    closure property of the admission SET, not a stapled-on label.
  * **The grading EMERGES on the test side of `^⊥` — soundly, not completely.** A test is
    JOIN-STABLE if its survivor set is join-closed; join-stability is inherited through the
    orthogonality (`coOrth_joinClosed`: an orthogonal of join-stable tests is join-closed), so any
    guard whose admission set is presented as `X^⊥` over join-stable tests is PROVED
    coordination-free (`behaviour_grade_sound`; the monotone pole re-derived purely through the
    orthogonality: `markGuard_grade_emerges`). The bounded pole's ceiling test is NOT join-stable
    (`ceiling_test_not_joinStable`) and its guard indeed forces ordering. But the grading is NOT
    complete: a behaviour over a family CONTAINING the unstable ceiling test can still be free
    (`grading_incomplete`) — the grade is a sound TYPE DISCIPLINE on `^⊥` (an upper bound on
    cost), not a semantic readout. S4's "coordination price as a modality on `^⊥`" is exactly the
    sound direction; the tier-1 verdict for an arbitrary guard remains `free_iff_joinClosed`
    (semantic), as `relational_decided_by_merge` already said.

## The honest bottom line

The bridge is LOAD-BEARING for the linear face — conservation is forced by the orthogonality once
(and only once) the test language is composite, and the boundary theorem is two-sided, not a
costume. The coordination grading is HALF-derived: sound through `^⊥`, semantically completed by
the join, and the CALM-flavored directed-union story is refuted on the deployed lattices.

Every keystone `#assert_axioms`-pinned.

non-join-stable ceiling test can still be join-closed (free): the pin test cuts the orthogonal
down to `{⊥}`, which is trivially join-closed. So the test-side grade is an UPPER BOUND on
coordination cost (sound), not a semantic readout (complete): the tier of an arbitrary guard
remains the semantic `free_iff_joinClosed` / `relational_decided_by_merge` question. -/

/-! ### §3(c) — REFUTATION of the conjectured directed-union form.

The conjecture (`monotone_guard_iff_directed_closed`, the CALM/Scott shape): coordination-free ⟺
admission set closed under directed unions. In dregg's deployed lattices it FAILS, and for a
structural reason: a DIRECTED set models one growing view — any two members already reconcile
INSIDE the set — while coordination cost is about DIVERGENT (incomparable) replicas. Concretely,
in `Budget` (ℕ-valued coordinates) every nonempty directed set with a LUB ATTAINS it, so
directed-lub-closure holds for EVERY subset — including the bounded guard's, which forces
ordering. -/

/-- Closure under LUBs of nonempty directed subsets (the dcpo/Scott-continuity shape). -/
def DirectedLubClosed [Preorder S] (A : Set S) : Prop :=
  ∀ D : Set S, D.Nonempty → DirectedOn (· ≤ ·) D → D ⊆ A → ∀ s, IsLUB D s → s ∈ A

/-- **In the deployed lattice every nonempty directed set ATTAINS its LUB.** Each coordinate's
value set is a nonempty bounded set of naturals, so its sup is attained at some member;
directedness reconciles the two coordinate-maximizers inside `D`, and that reconciler equals the
LUB. -/

/-- **`directed_conjecture_refuted` — the T2 conjecture is FALSE as stated.** The bounded
budget guard's admission set IS directed-lub-closed (vacuously), yet the guard FORCES ORDERING;
hence "directed-closed ⇒ coordination-free" fails (with this concrete witness). The correct
structural form is `free_iff_joinClosed` — pairwise joins over divergent replicas, which the
SAME admission set fails (`budget_admission_not_joinClosed`). -/

(join-stable tests, inherited); the join-closure discriminator fires on the bounded pole; the
directed-union (CALM) shape is blind on the very same admission set; and that set really does
force ordering. PARTIAL emergence, with the boundary exact. -/
