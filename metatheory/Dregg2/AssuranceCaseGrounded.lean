# Dregg2.AssuranceCaseGrounded — the DEPLOYED capstone re-rested on the crypto floor.

`AssuranceCase.deployed_system_secure` (the composed A∧B∧C∧D∧E apex over ONE deployed turn)
discharges guarantee E — light-client unfoolability — by consuming an ASSUMED
`es : EngineSound …` (`AssuranceCase.lean:903`, fed to `light_client_verifies_whole_history`
at `:936` and `conserves_from_verification` at `:939`). `EngineSound` bundles THREE soundness
legs as a hypothesis: `recursive_sound` (FRI), `leaf_sound` (per-leaf executor binding), and
`binding_sound` (the chain-ordering tooth). Two of those three were SHRUNK to the crypto floor
this session in `Dregg2.Circuit.GroundedApex`:

  * `leaf_sound` → DERIVED by `engineSound_of_refinements` from a `Forall₂ LeafRefinement`
    family (the per-effect `descriptorRefines` realizer data the honest prover supplies);
  * `binding_sound` → DISCHARGED by `binding_air_discharges_binding_sound` from a satisfying
    represented `TurnChainBindingAir` trace (`BindingExtract`, the binding-AIR realizer data),
    with NO crypto at all;
  * `recursive_sound` → carried as the named FRI carrier `hrec` (the one honest residual; the
    per-node content is reduced by `AggAirSound`, the whole-tree fold is not yet composed).

This file performs the migration the grounded-apex agent named, ADDITIVELY: it states
`deployed_system_secure_grounded`, whose conclusion is the SAME A∧B∧C∧D∧E conjunction as
`deployed_system_secure`, but whose guarantee-E leg threads an `EngineSound` DERIVED on the
spot by `GroundedApex.engineSound_grounded` from the crypto floor + the honest prover's realizer
data — so the assumed `EngineSound` hypothesis is GONE from the capstone's premise list. Nothing
upstream is mutated: `deployed_system_secure` and its every citation are untouched; this theorem
CALLS it, supplying the derived engine for `es`. Guarantees A–D pass through byte-for-byte (they
are orthogonal to the four carriers — they read the committed forest / noteSpend, not the engine).

## What the deployed capstone now trusts (vs before)

  BEFORE: `{Poseidon2-CR (the §8 commitment carriers), FRI/STARK soundness}` + an ASSUMED
          `EngineSound` (which itself bundled the leaf-binding and chain-ordering soundness as
          opaque hypotheses).
  AFTER:  `{Poseidon2-CR (the same §8 carriers: hCmb/hCompress/hCompressN/hLeaf/hRest + the
          sponge `Poseidon2SpongeCR hCR`), FRI recursion soundness (`hrec`)}` + the honest
          prover's REALIZER DATA (`hleaves` = the per-effect `LeafRefinement`/`descriptorRefines`
          family, `hbindExtract` = the represented binding-AIR trace). NO assumed `EngineSound`.

The leaf-binding and chain-ordering legs are no longer trusted — they are DERIVED. The residual
is strictly `{crypto floor + honest-prover realizer data}`. `#assert_axioms`-clean
(⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; every carrier a Prop/struct hypothesis, no fresh
axiom, no `sorry`). Standalone: `lake build Dregg2.AssuranceCaseGrounded`.

The file also exports `GroundedAssuranceWithCrypto`: the exact A–E outcome bundled with the existing
real-dimension ML-KEM, weighted-BLS, DECO-payment, and Hermine CR+Module-SIS reductions. This closes the
proof-suite composition gap, not the deployed-consumer correspondence: showing one concrete run's
handshake/certificate/attestation/commit-reveal values instantiate those parameters remains named.

/-- **`deployed_system_secure_grounded` (THE GROUNDED COMPOSED APEX — A∧B∧C∧D∧E, on the floor).**
The SAME conjunction `deployed_system_secure` proves — over the SAME committed running-entry forest
`execFullForestG s f = some s'` (A∧B∧C), the SAME committed noteSpend (D), and the SAME published
recursion aggregate a light client checks with ONE `verify agg.root` (E) — but with guarantee E's
whole-history leg routed through `GroundedApex.engineSound_grounded`: the assumed `EngineSound`
hypothesis is REPLACED by the crypto floor (`hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`, the §8 commitment
injectivity carriers `hCmb`/`hCompress`/`hCompressN`/`hLeaf`/`hRest`) + the honest prover's REALIZER
DATA (`hleaves` = the per-effect `LeafRefinement`/`descriptorRefines` family that DERIVES `leaf_sound`,
`hbindExtract` = the represented binding-AIR trace that DISCHARGES `binding_sound`) + the ONE named FRI
residual `hrec` (= `recursive_sound`, the recursion floor — carried, not axiomatized).

Guarantees A–D are UNCHANGED: they read the committed forest / noteSpend, orthogonal to the four
carriers, so they pass through `deployed_system_secure` byte-for-byte. The capstone's premise list no
longer carries an assumed `EngineSound`; it carries strictly `{crypto floor + realizer data}`. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity — the E-grounded engine FIRES on a real honest chain.

The migration's only delta is guarantee E: where the original capstone took an assumed
`es : EngineSound`, the grounded capstone DERIVES it via `engineSound_grounded`. Guarantees A–D
read the committed forest / noteSpend verbatim, so their inputs are exactly the original capstone's.
We therefore exhibit non-vacuity of the DELTA — the derived engine — on the honest teeth-genesis
chain (`teethGenesis ⟶ honestStep.post`), reusing the grounded apex's concrete realizer pieces: the
binding-AIR extraction is discharged CONCRETELY (`satisfies_one`/`represents_one` — so the keystone
`binding_air_discharges_binding_sound` is genuinely load-bearing), the recursion leg is the honest
accepting verifier, and the ONLY non-concrete input is the per-leaf `Forall₂ LeafRefinement` under the
accepting verifier — the SAME audited `Satisfied2`/STARK floor every grounded module carries (named
`hleaves`, not a hole). So the engine the grounded capstone threads into E is inhabited on a real
executor run, and concludes a TRUE executor fact. -/

authenticated-payment extraction, and the proper collision-resistance + Module-SIS advantage bound.
It does not claim that every deployed turn invokes all four mechanisms.  The remaining protocol-use

with these theorem parameters — stays named separately in the horizon ledger. -/
