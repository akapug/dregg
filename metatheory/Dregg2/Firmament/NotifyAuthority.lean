# Dregg2.Firmament.NotifyAuthority — async-signal AS a held capability (the `notify` brick, STEP 1).

This module is the **transfer triangle** of the `notify` primitive (`.docs-history-noclaude/NOTIFY-PRIMITIVE.md`):
it makes the *cap-algebra on async-signal authority* a THEOREM **before** the core `Auth` inductive
(`Authority/Positional.lean:37`) is touched. It adds NO core-`Auth` constructor, NO felt/Fintype/FFI
arm, NO VK bump — those are STEP 2 (the `Auth.notify` core edit + α-totalization, held for ember).
Here we work entirely firmament-locally, reusing what already exists.

## The hole this names (the census, in one line)

dregg runs async notification in at least five real places (the seL4 `Notification`, the inbox, the
pubsub broadcast, the dynamics stream, the blocklace `finality_notify`) and **not one expresses the
authority to signal as a held capability**. The seL4→Lean transcription found exactly this as the
single genuine projection-loss (`SeL4Abstract.lean:459`, `Notify ↦ none`): the firmament models a
`Notification` object distinctly from an `Endpoint`, but a cap to either confers the same dregg
authority, because dregg `Auth` has no `notify`. `notify` is the missing async dual of the synchronous
endpoint `write`/`call`: the pure "I may WAKE you" authority — no read, no synchronous message body, no
reply.

## We WELD — the Notification object EXISTS, disconnected; we connect a cap to it (do NOT reinvent)

Three things already exist and are REUSED verbatim (no new lattice, no new badge object):

  * `Dregg2.Firmament.SeL4Kernel.Notification` — the badge-OR accumulator (`signal n badge :=
    { badge := n.badge ||| badge }`, `wait` = read-and-clear), already green-refined against the Rust
    `EmulatedKernel::signal`/`wait` (`SeL4Kernel.lean:236`+, theorems `signal_then_wait` /
    `wait_observes_badge_or` / `second_wait_is_zero`). `signalGated` below is a cap-gated WRAPPER over
    this exact `Notification.signal` — it does not re-implement the accumulator.
  * `Dregg2.Exec.CapTPConcrete.facetAttenuation` — the `u32`-mask bit-subset decision
    `(child &&& parent) == child` (`CapTPConcrete.lean:146`, the Rust `is_facet_attenuation`), already
    reflexive (`facetAttenuation_refl`, via `Nat.and_self`) with `0` the bottom
    (`facetAttenuation_zero_bot`). **The badge mask is exactly this sub-lattice** — "may signal, but
    only badge ⊑ X" is `facetAttenuation X badge` (badge's bits are within the mask). We REUSE it as
    the badge order and complete it to a genuine partial order (antisymmetry + transitivity below),
    mirroring how `authNarrowerOrEqual` is proven a partial order.
  * `Dregg2.Firmament.CapGradation.grantOk` (= `authNarrowerOrEqual granted held`, the Rust
    `is_attenuation`) — the ONE non-amplification decision the firmament `mint` gate already proves
    non-amplifying (`SeL4Kernel.lean:175`). A `NotifyCap` carries an `AuthReq` rights field (the seL4
    `NotificationCap oref badge cap_rights` shape, `SeL4Abstract.lean:149`), so its RIGHTS attenuation
    rides `grantOk` verbatim; the badge mask is the ADDITIONAL payload-scope sub-lattice. Attenuation
    narrows BOTH (`attenuateNotify`), refusing a widening on either.

So the design's "the badge-mask is the SAME `granted ⊆ held` order the mint already proves
non-amplifying" is structural here: the mask order IS `facetAttenuation` (the same `u32`-mask leg the
handoff validator runs, `handoffNonAmplifyingC`'s effect-mask facet), and the rights order IS the same
`grantOk` the mint gates on. We add no order — we instantiate two existing ones on a notification cap.

## What is proven

  1. **NON-AMPLIFICATION (the badge mask is a sub-lattice).** `maskNarrowerOrEqual` (= `facetAttenuation`)
     is a genuine partial order on the badge lattice (reflexive / antisymmetric / transitive, `0` ⊥).
     `attenuateNotify` narrows the mask (and the rights) only by that order; the keystone
     `signalGated_attenuate_no_amplify` shows a signal admissible through the ATTENUATED (narrower-mask)
     cap is admissible through the original — narrowing the mask only SHRINKS the admissible badge set.
     A widening (a mask with a bit not held) is REFUSED by `attenuateNotify` (`none`).
  2. **GATE TEETH (both polarities).** `signalGated` COMMITS (`some`, OR'ing the masked badge into the
     accumulator) iff the signalled badge is within the held mask, and REFUSES (`none`) a badge with a
     bit outside the mask — both `#guard`'d. The attenuated `[.notify]` ("may poke, may not message")
     is EXPRESSIBLE and DISTINCT from `write`: a `NotifyCap`'s conferred authority contains `Notify` but
     NOT `SyncSend` (the synchronous send) — the new expressivity the design names.
  3. **WELL-FORMEDNESS (seL4-faithful).** A notification cap (`SeL4Abstract.Cap.NotificationCap`)
     confers at most `{Reset, Receive, Notify}` — never `{Grant, Call, Reply}` — exactly the
     `SeL4Abstract.lean:225` strip (the `NotificationCap` case filters `AllowGrant`/`AllowGrantReply`
     before `capRightsToAuth`). And `Notify` is distinct from the synchronous `SyncSend`/`Call`/`Reply`,
     so the async wake is a genuinely separate authority from the sync write/call/reply.

NON-VACUITY both polarities (`#guard` teeth that BITE): a within-mask signal COMMITS with the masked
badge OR'd; an out-of-mask signal REFUSES; attenuation to a narrower mask COMMITS and the narrower cap
admits strictly fewer badges; a widening attenuation REFUSES; `Notify ∈` / `SyncSend ∉` a notification
cap's authority.

Discipline: axiom-clean (`#assert_all_clean` at the close) — `decide`
/ `#guard` / `rw`-over-`Nat.and_*` only. `lake build` green (LOCAL). NO core-`Auth` edit; NO felt
encoder touched. ObjId/badge are `Nat` (the Rust `u64` object id / `u64` badge), as in `SeL4Kernel`.

/-! ## §1 — The badge-mask sub-lattice (REUSED from `facetAttenuation`, completed to a partial order).

The badge a `signal` carries is a `u64` discriminator (scope / membership / fault — the seL4 badge).
A `notify` cap's reach is a **badge mask**: "may signal, but only badge ⊑ `badgeMask`". "badge ⊑ mask"
means the signalled bits are a SUBSET of the mask's bits — exactly `facetAttenuation mask badge`
(`badge &&& mask == badge`), the SAME `u32`-mask bit-subset the captp handoff validator runs
(`CapTPConcrete.lean:146`). We REUSE it as the badge order and prove it a genuine partial order — the
same shape as `authNarrowerOrEqual`'s order — so "the badge mask is a sub-lattice" is a theorem. -/

/-- **`maskNarrowerOrEqual m₁ m₂`** — `m₁` is narrower-than-or-equal to `m₂` on the badge lattice:
`m₁`'s bits are a SUBSET of `m₂`'s (`m₁ ⊆ m₂`). This IS `facetAttenuation m₂ m₁` (the reused
`u32`-mask bit-subset, `child ⊆ parent`); we name it on the badge to read as the cap-attenuation order
"the narrower mask is within the wider". A notify cap attenuates by narrowing the mask under THIS
order. -/
def maskNarrowerOrEqual (m₁ m₂ : Nat) : Bool := facetAttenuation m₂ m₁

/-- **`badgeWithinMask badge mask`** — the signalled `badge` is within the cap's `mask` (admissible):
its bits are a subset of the mask's (`badge ⊆ mask`). This is `facetAttenuation mask badge`. The
admissibility predicate the gate runs. -/

theorem maskNarrowerOrEqual_zero_bot (m : Nat) : maskNarrowerOrEqual 0 m = true :=

/-- Antisymmetry: mutual narrower-or-equal forces equality — the badge order has no cycle (a buggy

/-! ## §2 — The `NotifyCap`: the right to WAKE a target (the async dual of the endpoint call).

Mirrors seL4's `NotificationCap oref badge cap_rights` (`SeL4Abstract.lean:149`): a target object, the
held `cap_rights` (the SAME `AuthReq` lattice the firmament mint gates on), and the badge-mask scope.
Holding `NotifyCap target rights mask` means: *you may `signal` `target` with a badge ⊑ `mask`, and
nothing else* — no read, no synchronous send, no reply (that is the §3 well-formedness). -/

/-- **`NotifyCap`** — a held capability to cause a WAKE on `target`, scoped to badges within
`badgeMask`. The `rights : AuthReq` field carries the seL4 cap-rights (so the rights attenuation rides
the existing `grantOk`); the `badgeMask : Nat` is the payload-scope sub-lattice (§1). This is the
async dual of an endpoint-call cap: it confers the right to poke, not to message. -/

/-- **`attenuateNotify cap narrowerRights narrowerMask`** — narrow a notify cap on BOTH axes, gated on

`granted ⊆ held`, REUSED), the badge mask by `maskNarrowerOrEqual narrowerMask cap.badgeMask` (= the
`u32`-mask bit-subset, REUSED). Returns the narrowed cap, or `none` if EITHER axis would amplify (a
rights widening OR a mask with a bit not held). This is the cap-algebra attenuation the design's §2.2
names — and it is the same two `granted ⊆ held` orders already proven non-amplifying. -/

  else

end NotifyCap

/-- **`signalGated cap n badge`** — the cap-gated WRAPPER over the existing
`SeL4Kernel.Notification.signal` (`SeL4Kernel.lean:250`). A signal is permitted iff the holder's
`NotifyCap` admits the badge (`badge ⊑ badgeMask`); when permitted, it OR's the **masked** badge
(`badge &&& badgeMask`, which equals `badge` exactly when admissible, §1) into the accumulator via the
unchanged `Notification.signal`; otherwise it REFUSES (`none`). The async-signal authority, expressed
as a gate over the badge-OR object — NOT a re-implementation of it. -/

/-! ## §3 — NON-AMPLIFICATION: attenuating a notify cap only SHRINKS what it can signal.

`attenuateNotify` narrows by the two existing `granted ⊆ held` orders (rights via `grantOk`, mask via
`maskNarrowerOrEqual`); a widening on either axis is REFUSED. The keystone: a badge admissible through
the ATTENUATED (narrower-mask) cap is admissible through the original — so a holder who attenuates can
signal a SUBSET of what it could before. A `signal` of a badge outside the held mask is REFUSED.

This is the firmament `mint`'s non-amplification (`mint_child_attenuates_parent` /
`mint_refuses_amplification`), now on the badge lattice: a notify cap attenuates by narrowing the
badge-mask, and a widening (signalling a badge not held / handing out more badge-reach than held) is
refused. -/

/-- **ATTENUATE NARROWS BOTH AXES** (the positive direction): when `attenuateNotify` succeeds, the
result holds EXACTLY the requested narrower rights and mask, both `⊆` the original (`grantOk` on the
rights, `maskNarrowerOrEqual` on the mask) — a genuine attenuation on both, never an amplification. -/

it may signal — it never lets the holder wake with a badge the parent could not. (The mask narrowed,
so `badgeWithinMask_mono` lifts admissibility from the child mask up to the parent mask.) This is the
async-signal mirror of `mint_child_attenuates_parent`. -/

/-! ## §4 — WELL-FORMEDNESS: a notification cap confers at most `{notify, read}` (seL4-faithful).

The §3 gate makes `notify` a held authority; this section pins that it is the RIGHT authority and a
DISTINCT one. We work over the transcribed-seL4 `SeL4Abstract.Cap`/`Auth`/`capAuthConferred` (which
already has `.Notify`/`.Receive` — the seL4-faithful 12-ctor enum, NOT the core dregg `Auth`, so this
touches no Step-2 surface). The fact: an seL4 `NotificationCap` confers at most `{Reset, Receive,
Notify}` — never `{Grant, Call, Reply}` — because the `NotificationCap` case of `capAuthConferred`
filters out `AllowGrant`/`AllowGrantReply` BEFORE `capRightsToAuth` (`SeL4Abstract.lean:225`). And
`Notify` is distinct from the synchronous `SyncSend`/`Call`/`Reply`: the async wake is a separate
authority from the sync write/call/reply — the new corner `notify` carves. -/

/-! ## §5 — NON-VACUITY TEETH (`#guard`): both polarities BITE, on concrete badges.

/-! ## §5.5 — RE-BIND ONTO THE REAL `Dregg2.Authority.Auth` (Step-2: notify is a KERNEL authority).

Step 1 (above) made the cap-algebra-on-async-signal a theorem firmament-locally — the badge-mask is the
REAL `CapTPConcrete.facetAttenuation` (the Rust `is_facet_attenuation`, NOT a standalone copy) and the
well-formedness is over the transcribed-seL4 `SeL4Abstract.Auth`. With `Auth.notify` now a first-class
constructor of the REAL kernel authority lattice (`Authority/Positional.lean:38`), this section BINDS the
notify authority into that lattice: the "may poke, may not message" cap is now EXPRESSIBLE as a real
`Dregg2.Authority.Cap`, its non-amplification IS the real `Dregg2.Exec.attenuate_subset` (the
constructor-agnostic attenuation, invariant under the new ctor), and the badge-mask sub-lattice rides
the SAME orders. No firmament-local copy: the kernel `Auth.notify` and the real `attenuate`/`facetAttenuation`
ARE the badge-mask discipline.

The §4 `open Dregg2.Firmament.SeL4Abstract (Auth Cap capAuthConferred)` puts the SEL4 `Auth`/`Cap`/
`capAuthConferred` in scope (the 12-ctor transcription), so here we FULLY QUALIFY the REAL kernel names
(`Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify`, `Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint`, `Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred`,
`Dregg2.Exec.attenuate`) to avoid the clash — every name below is the REAL kernel lattice. -/

/-- **The "may poke, may not message" cap, on the REAL lattice.** A real `Cap.endpoint t [.notify]`
confers EXACTLY `[Auth.notify]` (the `capAuthConferred` of an endpoint is its rights verbatim,
`Positional.lean:68`) — the held authority to WAKE `t` and nothing else. This is the NEW expressivity
`notify` adds to the real lattice: before `Auth.notify`, you could only hand out `write` (send) or
nothing; now "may wake, may not send" is a real held cap. -/
theorem notifyCap_confers_notify (t : Dregg2.Authority.Label) :
    Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred (Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint t [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify]) = [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify] := rfl

/-- **A real notify cap does NOT confer the `write`-send authority** — `Auth.write ∉` what
`Cap.endpoint t [.notify]` confers. The async wake is genuinely separate from the synchronous send ON
THE REAL LATTICE: holding "may poke" does not grant "may message". (The kernel-level mirror of the
firmament `notify_cap_confers_notify_not_syncsend`.) -/
theorem notifyCap_not_write (t : Dregg2.Authority.Label) :
    Dregg2.Authority.Auth.write ∉ Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred (Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint t [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify]) := by
  -- `capAuthConferred (.endpoint t r) = r` definitionally (independent of `t`), so the goal is the
  -- CLOSED `.write ∉ [.notify]`; `show` exposes it for `decide` (which can't reduce under the binder `t`).
  show Dregg2.Authority.Auth.write ∉ [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify]
  decide

/-- **A real notify-only cap confers NO connectivity edge** (the executor-edge tooth). `confersEdgeTo`
(`AuthTurn.lean:34`, the SAME `.any` body the reconstructed `execGraph` reads) requires
`rights.contains Auth.write` — so a `Cap.endpoint t [.notify]` does NOT confer an edge to `t`. This is
the sharpest real-lattice statement of "may poke, may not message": at the executor's connectivity gate,
a pure wake-right is INVISIBLE (it grants no Granovetter introduction), exactly as it should be — a wake
is not a message. (Contrast: `Cap.endpoint t [.write]` DOES confer the edge.) -/
theorem notifyCap_confers_no_edge (t : Dregg2.Authority.Label) :
    Dregg2.Exec.confersEdgeTo t (Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint t [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify]) = false := by
  -- `confersEdgeTo` needs `node t` OR (`endpoint t r` ∧ `r.contains write`); `[.notify]` has neither
  -- (the `t == t` reduces, the `.contains .write` is `false`). `simp` discharges it under the binder.
  simp [Dregg2.Exec.confersEdgeTo]

/-- …and the `write` cap DOES confer the edge — so the distinction is real, not vacuous: the SAME
endpoint target, `[.write]` vs `[.notify]`, gives opposite connectivity verdicts. -/
theorem writeCap_confers_edge (t : Dregg2.Authority.Label) :
    Dregg2.Exec.confersEdgeTo t (Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint t [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.write]) = true := by
  simp [Dregg2.Exec.confersEdgeTo]

/-- **NON-AMPLIFICATION on the REAL lattice (the keystone, re-bound).** Attenuating a real cap to keep
ONLY `[.notify]` (drop send/grant/call/…) confers a SUBSET of the original authority — this IS the real
`Dregg2.Exec.attenuate_subset`, which is constructor-agnostic (a `List.filter` on `keep`) and therefore
INVARIANT under adding `Auth.notify`. So "hand out a notify-only cap" is provably non-amplifying by the
EXISTING kernel theorem — no new proof, the firmament `signalAdmissible_attenuate_no_amplify` (the
badge-mask leg) and this (the rights leg) are the two `granted ⊆ held` legs of one attenuation. -/
theorem notify_attenuate_real_no_amplify (c : Dregg2.Authority.Cap) :
    Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred (Dregg2.Exec.attenuate [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify] c)
      ⊆ Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred c :=
  Dregg2.Exec.attenuate_subset [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify] c

/-- **Attenuating to `[.notify]` keeps the wake-right when held, drops everything else** (the positive
direction, witnessed on a full cap): a `Cap.endpoint t [.write, .notify]` attenuated to keep `[.notify]`
confers exactly `[.notify]` — the send-right is dropped, the wake-right retained. The "downgrade a
send+wake cap to wake-only" move, on the real lattice. -/
theorem notify_attenuate_keeps_wake_drops_send (t : Dregg2.Authority.Label) :
    Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred (Dregg2.Exec.attenuate [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify] (Dregg2.Authority.Cap.endpoint t [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.write, Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify]))
      = [Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify] := by
  -- `attenuate keep (.endpoint t r) = .endpoint t (r.filter (keep.contains ·))` and `capAuthConferred`
  -- returns the filtered rights — independent of `t`. `simp` reduces the filter; the closed result is
  -- `[.notify]` (`.write` filtered out, `.notify` kept).
  simp [Dregg2.Exec.attenuate, Dregg2.Authority.capAuthConferred]

/-- **THE α-IMAGE BINDING — the firmament's `Notify` IS the real `notify`.** The transcribed-seL4
`SeL4Abstract.Notify` authority α-projects to the real kernel `Auth.notify` (`SeL4Abstract.alpha`, the
`Notify ↦ some .notify` arm). So a notification cap's `Notify` (the §4 well-formedness, over the 12-ctor
seL4 `Auth`) and the real kernel `notify` authority are the SAME thing under the relabelling — the Step-1
firmament well-formedness and this Step-2 kernel binding are two views of one authority, joined by α. -/
theorem firmament_Notify_alpha_real_notify :
    Dregg2.Firmament.SeL4Abstract.alpha .Notify = some Dregg2.Authority.Auth.notify := rfl

/-- **A real notify cap (the badge-mask carrier) attenuates non-amplifyingly on BOTH legs** — the full
re-binding, stated once. A `NotifyCap` over `target` whose rights ride `AuthReq` and whose payload-scope
rides the badge-mask: narrowing it via `attenuateNotify` shrinks the admissible badge set
(`signalAdmissible_attenuate_no_amplify`, the badge-mask `granted ⊆ held`), AND the conferred kernel
authority of the corresponding real `Cap.endpoint target [.notify]` is bounded by `attenuate_subset` (the
rights `granted ⊆ held`). The two legs are the SAME non-amplification law (`facetAttenuation` /
`attenuate`), now on the kernel `Auth.notify`. -/
