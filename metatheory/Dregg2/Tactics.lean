# Dregg2.Tactics — shared proof automation for the dregg2 metatheory.

Small helpers shared across modules and executable protocols. These close routine
goals (reflexivity, definitional simp, injection cleanup, linear arithmetic) — not a way
to make a real obligation look discharged. If a helper does not close a goal, the goal is
real: prove it properly or leave it as an explicit open obligation with a one-line reason.
(Never `admit`, never a fresh `axiom`, never `native_decide` on a non-decidable prop.)

/-! ## Axiom-hygiene tripwire — the faked-green regression guard.

`#assert_axioms` elaborates to an error if the named declaration's axiom set escapes
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (notably: any faked-green axiom). It can only reject,
never close a goal. Pin it under each proved keystone.

Defined at top level (outside the namespace) so the command token parses in every
importing module without needing `open`.

(Honest note on §8 oracles: `CryptoKernel`/`World`/`Verifiable` obligations enter as
typeclass parameters/hypotheses, NOT `axiom`-keyword declarations, so they do not appear
in `collectAxioms` and do not trip this guard. A genuine `axiom`-keyword oracle, were one
ever added, would need to be allow-listed by name with a comment — by design.) -/

/-- The kernel-clean triple. ONE source of truth for what "axiom-clean" means; every
checker below (`#assert_axioms`, `#assert_clean`, `#assert_all_clean`,

/-! ## `#assert_not_depends_on` — the SEMANTICS-FREEDOM tripwire (proof-term closure guard).

`#assert_axioms` pins which AXIOMS a proof rests on. It says nothing about which DEFINITIONS a proof
walks through — so a theorem advertised as "syntactic, independent of the denotational tower" can be
re-proved through that tower and stay axiom-clean, hence green. Declaration ORDER makes the
independence true at the moment of writing but does not KEEP it true: a later edit that moves the
theorem, or that cites a denotational lemma proved earlier in some other file, restores the
dependency silently.

`#assert_not_depends_on foo [Bar, baz]` closes that hole. It walks the TRANSITIVE constant closure of
`foo`'s proof term (`ConstantInfo.value?` with `allowOpaque := true` — required for theorems, whose
values are opaque; a walk that omits it sees an EMPTY closure and passes everything) and throws a
build-time ERROR, naming the full dependency PATH, if any forbidden constant is reachable.

Anti-toothless conditions, each a hard ERROR rather than a pass:
  * an EMPTY forbidden list — a guard forbidding nothing;
  * a forbidden ident that does not resolve (`unknownConstant` from `realizeGlobalConst…`);
  * a root that is not in the environment at all (a closure of 0 constants).
A forbidden name MATCHES a reached constant if it is equal to it or a `Name` PREFIX of it, so
generated companions (`Matches.eq_def`, `Matches._eq_2`, `Foo.match_1`) count as hits and cannot
launder the dependency.

**The scanned-count is NOT a blindness detector — MEASURED FALSE, do not reintroduce that claim.**
An earlier revision asserted that a low `scanned` count would catch a lost `allowOpaque := true`.
It does not. Built with `allowOpaque := false` and run against a deliberately SEMANTIC re-proof of
`PredRE.sim_null` (`simpa only [derives] using sim_derives h []`), the walk reported `hit = none`
with `scanned = 36`: the forbidden dependency was MISSED while the count sat far above any
tripwire, because the root's TYPE constants are still walked even when its VALUE is invisible. A
blind walk therefore reports every `#assert_not_depends_on` in the tree CLEAN, vacuously.

Blindness is covered instead by `#assert_depends_on` — the exact DUAL rejector, sharing this same
`findForbiddenPath` walk, so the two go blind together or not at all. Pinning a dependency that
exists ONLY through a proof term (`#assert_depends_on PredRE.sim_derives [PredRE.sim_sound]`) makes
a value-blind walk a BUILD FAILURE rather than a green vacuous pass. Every module that relies on
`#assert_not_depends_on` should carry at least one such positive control. -/

/-- Does forbidden name `f` match reached constant `n`? Equality, or `f` a component-wise `Name`
prefix of `n` — so a proof reaching `Matches.eq_def` is caught by forbidding `Matches`, while
`sim_der` does NOT spuriously match `sim_derives` (different final atoms). -/

/-! ## `@[gate_projection]` — the gate-EXTRACT marker (NOT an authority guarantee).

A `@[gate_projection]` theorem has the shape `<step> = some _ → <the step def's OWN gate>` and is proved
by `unfold <step>; exact h.1` (a `by_cases` on the gate conjunction, projecting the held conjunct out of
the commit). It RE-LISTS the executor's own `if`-guard: it reds on any gate edit (so it pins the gate's
SHAPE), but in ISOLATION it constrains nothing — proving "the committed step satisfies its own gate" is a
tautology-in-spirit, not an independent authority fact.

The GENUINE authority binding for an effect is the iff/triangle over an INDEPENDENT spec — e.g.
`Circuit.Spec.SupplyCreation.mintA_authorized`, derived through `execMintA_iff_spec` over the
linter-PASS `MintASpec` (`Verify.LoadBearingLint`). A `@[gate_projection]`-tagged lemma is fine as a
LOCAL helper (handler-floor `auth_gated`, fail-closed plumbing); it must NEVER be cited as a top-level
authority GUARANTEE. The tag is a documentation marker (no proof power) so a reader/auditor cannot
mistake a gate-extract for the real binding. -/

/-- The `@[gate_projection]` tag — marks a `<step> = some _ → <own-gate>` gate-EXTRACT (proved
`unfold; exact h.1`). A documentation marker ONLY: it carries no proof power and gates nothing. Its job
is to STOP a gate-extract from reading as an authority guarantee — the genuine binding is the
executor⟺independent-spec iff (see the module note above). -/

/-! ## `@[linter_calibration]` — the DELIBERATE-linter-fixture marker.

A `@[linter_calibration]` declaration is a fixture that exists SOLELY to exercise (calibrate) a
rejector — it is constructed to be the kind of thing a checker MUST reject, so that a checker which
fails to reject it is provably toothless. It is NOT spec debt: it is a negative test masquerading, by
shape, as the thing being tested. Two such fixtures calibrate `Verify.LoadBearingLint`:

  * `Dregg2.Verify.LoadBearingAuditKey.gateCopyBurnSpec` — a "spec" that calls the executor STEP gate
    `recCBurnAsset` directly. It calibrates the linter's BOUNDARY check (#1): the linter MUST FAIL it.
  * `Dregg2.Spec.execGraph` — a graph reconstructed VERBATIM as the executor's `.any confersEdgeTo`
    lookup gate, so it is `isDefEq` to that gate (`execGraph_eq_any := rfl`). It calibrates the
    linter's DEFEQ check (#2): the linter MUST FAIL it. Its GENUINE counterpart — the independent
    authority-connectivity spec the C-c1 legs actually attest against — is `Spec.authConnects`
    (linter-PASS, grounded in `Metatheory.AuthorizedProduction`). `execGraph` survives only as (a) this
    calibration fixture and (b) the executor-side gate-relation that TRANSPORTS onto `authConnects`
    (`execGraph_iff_authConnects` / `execGraph_has_iff_authConnects_has`).

The two together are the linter's INTENDED NEGATIVE-CALIBRATION PAIR: every `#load_bearing_audit*`
sweep is expected to produce exactly these two FAILs, and the calibration is ASSERTED (not left a
silent FAIL count) by `#load_bearing_calibration_expect_fail` in the audit modules. The tag is a
documentation marker only — it carries no proof power and gates nothing; its job is to STOP an auditor
reading a deliberate gate-copy as a real-but-broken authority spec. -/

/-- The `@[linter_calibration]` tag — marks a DELIBERATE checker-calibration fixture (a gate-copy /
boundary-violator built to be REJECTED, so the rejector is proven non-toothless). A documentation
marker ONLY: no proof power, gates nothing. Its job is to STOP a deliberate gate-copy from reading as
real spec debt — see the module note above. The genuine counterpart of the `execGraph` calibration is
the independent `Spec.authConnects`. -/

     REJECTED) — NOT spec debt; carries no proof power"

/-! ## `#assert_namespace_axioms` — module-wide axiom-hygiene pinning.

`#assert_namespace_axioms` pins every theorem under a namespace to the three standard
kernel axioms in one line: it walks `getEnv`, finds every theorem under the prefix, runs
`collectAxioms`, and throws if any depends on an axiom outside
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (notably a faked-green axiom). Pure rejector — it can only
error, never close a goal.

**The `except` list (honesty caveat).** A name in the `except` clause is skipped (and
reported). Use this for keystones that legitimately rest on a §8 oracle or a Law-1
open primitive — each skip must be justified by a comment, preserving the discipline
that a keystone resting on a primitive is not pinned.

as typeclass parameters / hypotheses do not appear in `collectAxioms`. By design.) -/

primitive — justify each with a comment). Logs the count pinned. Pure rejector. -/
