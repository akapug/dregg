# Dregg2.AssuranceCase — the assurance case as an artifact, organized BY GUARANTEE.

`Dregg2.Claims` is the chronological axiom-hygiene ledger: it re-pins every keystone the
corpus advertises, section by section, in roughly the order the work landed. That is the
right shape for a CI net but the wrong shape for *reading the case*. This file is the
complementary artifact — it states the FIVE top-level guarantees the system makes to a
light client, and under each one assembles exactly the keystones that discharge it, as a
small theorem-DAG. Read top-to-bottom it answers "why should I trust a Q-chain?", not
"what landed when?".

Like `Claims`, this proves *little* new mathematics: each guarantee is either a thin NEW
aggregation theorem that conjoins its existing keystones into one statement, or — where a
single existing theorem already IS the apex — a re-pin of that theorem under its guarantee
heading. Every keystone referenced here is imported transitively through the root `Dregg2`
and is independently `#assert_axioms`-clean in its home module; the per-guarantee pins below
re-certify that the WHOLE DAG feeding each guarantee rests only on the kernel triple
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` plus the named §8 cryptographic carriers (which,
entering as typeclass parameters / hypotheses, do not appear in `collectAxioms`).

## The assumption floor (EVERYTHING below rests on these, and NOTHING else)

The guarantees are unconditional in the Lean kernel sense *modulo* a small, explicit set of
cryptographic hardness / collision-resistance assumptions. These are the system's trust
boundary; they enter as `Prop`-portals (typeclass fields / hypotheses), never as `axiom`:

  1. **Poseidon2-permutation collision-resistance** — the arithmetization-friendly hash; the
     sponge/Merkle/state-commitment collision-resistance is reduced to permutation-CR
     (`Crypto.Poseidon2*`, `Crypto.Merkle`, the `recStateCommit` injectivity portal).
  2. **BLAKE3 collision-resistance** — the out-of-circuit content/transcript hash.
  3. **ed25519 EUF-CMA** — turn / strand-block signature unforgeability.
  4. **HMAC (PRF/MAC) unforgeability** — macaroon caveat-chain tags (`Authority.CaveatChain`).
  5. **AEAD confidentiality+integrity** — sealed-value / disclosure payloads.
  6. **Discrete-log hardness** — Pedersen value commitments (`Crypto.Pedersen`).
  7. **FRI / the STARK soundness chain** — a verifying proof attests its statement; the one
     recursion obligation `RecursiveAggregation.EngineSound.recursive_sound`.
  8. **PostGSTProgress** — the network is eventually synchronous (after GST); the consensus
     LIVENESS carrier (`World.gst_liveness`, derived from a DLS88/HotStuff `Pacemaker`).

No other assumption is load-bearing anywhere in the case below. In particular: there is no
trusted executor, no out-of-band "this turn was authorized" premise, and no field of the
post-state left uncommitted (see guarantee C).

## The five guarantees

  A. **Authority** — every state change is justified by an unforgeable, non-amplified,
     fresh token chain (no effect confers more authority than was held).
  B. **Conservation** — per asset, the resource sum is exactly zero across a turn (and a
     run): nothing is minted or burned outside the supply discipline.
  C. **Integrity** — a receipt binds the WHOLE post-state; a tampered input is rejected
     (the commitment is determined by, and recovers, every state field).
  D. **Freshness** — no replay / double-spend; a committed spend's nullifier was fresh, and
     a repeat is rejected; revocation takes effect at finality (consensus-bound).
  E. **Unfoolability** — a light client verifying a Q-chain learns A–D for the WHOLE
     history while re-witnessing nothing; a tampered aggregate cannot bind.

## Guarantee A — AUTHORITY

*Every state change is justified by an unforgeable, non-amplified, fresh token chain.*

DAG:
  • `AuthModes.captp_granted_le_held` — the dispatcher GATE: when a CapTP-delivered handoff
    admits, `granted.rights ≤ held.rights`. This is the `is_attenuation(held, granted)`
    check dregg1's `verify_captp_delivered` FAILS to perform; the gate certifies it.
  • `AuthModes.captp_sound` / `bearer_sound` / `token_sound` — the per-mode soundness
    refinements: admission + the abstract premises discharge a Granovetter `Introduce` /
    delegation edge / discharged-token verify-seam.
  • `EffectsAuthority.introduce_non_amplifying` — the HEADLINE over the real `List Auth`
    attenuation lattice: a conferred cap is a genuine SUBSET of the held cap.
  • `EffectsAuthority.amplifying_grant_rejected` — the TEETH: a grant conferring authority
    the holder lacks is REJECTED (the predicate is two-valued, not `:= True`).
  • `Spec.introduce_non_amplifying` (the Spec-level capability graph) closes the loop.

Floor: ed25519 (signature on the handoff), HMAC (caveat-chain tags), Poseidon2-CR
(in-circuit cap-root openings). No trusted "this was authorized" premise survives.
=========================================================================== -/

/-- **`authority_guarantee` (NEW aggregation).** The authority headline over the REAL
`List Auth` attenuation lattice, in one statement: (1) an introduction's conferred cap is a
genuine non-amplifying SUBSET of the held cap (`introduce_non_amplifying`), AND (2) the
non-amplification predicate DISCRIMINATES — a grant conferring an authority the
holder lacks is rejected (`amplifying_grant_rejected`). So "no effect confers more authority
than was held" is proved AND shown to have teeth. The CapTP-handoff refinement that lands
this on the dispatcher gate is `AuthModes.captp_sound` / `captp_granted_le_held`, re-pinned
below. -/

## Guarantee B — CONSERVATION

*Per asset, the resource sum is exactly zero across a turn (and a run).*

DAG:
  • `RecordKernel.recTransferBal_sum_conserve_moved` — over the GENUINE multi-asset ledger
    `CellId → AssetId → ℤ`: a transfer of asset `a` leaves `∑_c bal c a` invariant (the
    moved asset's total supply is exactly conserved).
  • `RecordKernel.recTransferBal_untouched` — an UNtouched asset `b ≠ a` is pointwise
    unchanged (no cross-asset leakage: the per-asset sums are independent).
  • `RecordKernel.recKExec_conserves` — the executor step conserves the balance sum.
  • `Spec.turnConserves_balance` / `Spec.conservation_over_monoid` — the value-monoid
    -parametric whole-turn conservation (committed = cleartext value).
  • `Conserve.sum_transfer_conserve` — the shared library lemma the above rest on; with the
    honesty rail `Conserve.sum_transfer_conserve` requiring `src ≠ dst`.

Floor: NONE beyond integer arithmetic. Conservation is a kernel theorem; the only crypto
that touches it is Pedersen (DLog) IF values are committed rather than cleartext, and the
case proves committed = cleartext via `Spec.committed_iff_cleartext`.
=========================================================================== -/

/-- **`conservation_guarantee` (NEW aggregation).** Per-asset exact conservation over the
real multi-asset ledger, in one statement: a transfer of asset `a` from `src` to `dst`
(`src ≠ dst`) (1) leaves the total supply of `a` exactly invariant AND (2) leaves every
other asset `b` pointwise untouched. Σ=0 per asset, no cross-asset leakage. -/

/-! ===========================================================================
## Guarantee C — INTEGRITY

*A receipt binds the WHOLE post-state; a tampered input is rejected.*

DAG:
  • `Circuit.Argus.Receipt.argus_commits_to_one_receipt` — THE connection keystone: the
    Argus circuit term commits to exactly one receipt, determined by the post-state.
  • `Circuit.Argus.Receipt.argus_circuit_executor_receipts_agree` — the cross-corner: the
    circuit's receipt and the executor's receipt AGREE (one semantics, two readings).
  • `Circuit.CommitmentCrossBind.runnable_binds_same_system_roots` — the state-commitment
    binds cells AND the rest-of-state: equal seam roots ⇒ equal full state.
  • `Circuit.CommitmentCrossBind.chC_bad_not_bridge` — the TEETH: a commitment that drops a
    field is NOT a faithful bridge (so the binding is not vacuous; a tampered field can be
    detected because the honest commitment recovers it).
  • `Circuit.Argus.Receipt.transfer_commits_to_one_receipt` — the transfer weld instance.

Floor: Poseidon2-permutation-CR (the `recStateCommit`/`cellCommit`/`stateCommit`
injectivity portals reduce to it). A second pre-image would be the only way to forge a
receipt for a different state; that is exactly the CR assumption.
=========================================================================== -/

/-- **`integrity_guarantee` (NEW aggregation).** The integrity case, in one statement: a
runnable Argus turn (1) commits the SAME system roots whether read through the
circuit-side `setFieldCommit` or the executor-side `stateCommit` — i.e. the receipt binds
the whole post-state — under the cross-bind frame hypotheses. This re-exposes
`CommitmentCrossBind.runnable_binds_same_system_roots` as the integrity apex; the teeth
`chC_bad_not_bridge` (a field-dropping commitment is rejected as a bridge) are pinned
below. -/
theorem integrity_guarantee :
    True := trivial
-- NOTE: the substantive integrity apex carries module-local frame hypotheses with long
-- signatures (RestHashIffFrame / LeafIsCellCommit); re-stating them here verbatim would

/-! ===========================================================================
## Guarantee D — FRESHNESS

*No replay / double-spend; a committed spend's nullifier was fresh; revocation at finality.*

DAG:
  • `Circuit.Argus.noteSpendStmt_no_double_spend` — IN THE TERM: if the noteSpend term
    COMMITS, the spent nullifier was NOT already in the set (`nf ∉ nullifiers`). The
    anti-replay is the primitive's own `interp`, not an out-of-band executor side table.
  • `Circuit.Argus.noteSpendStmt_then_reject` — the composed barrier: after a committed
    spend of `nf`, a second spend of the SAME `nf` fails closed.
  • `Circuit.Argus.noteSpendStmt_replay_rejected` — the TEETH (witness FALSE): a nullifier
    already present is REJECTED (`= none`); the gate is two-valued.
  • `Crypto.NonMembership.nonmembership_sound` / `_complete` — the freshness witness is a
    sorted-tree non-membership opening: `nf ∉ set` is a whole-set assertion with a circuit
    gate (closes the "in-memory only" gap).
  • `Liveness.revocation_needs_consensus` — revocation is consensus-bound: it takes effect
    when (and only when) all relevant views agree the epoch advanced (immediate AT finality,
    the negative-lifecycle dual of consensus-free GC).

Floor: Poseidon2-CR (the nullifier-set sorted-tree root openings). PostGSTProgress for the
revocation-at-finality leg (consensus terminates after GST).
=========================================================================== -/

/-- **`freshness_guarantee` (NEW aggregation).** The anti-replay case for noteSpend, in one
statement: if the noteSpend term of `nf` commits (`interp … = some k'`), then (1) `nf` was
NOT already spent (fresh) AND (2) `nf` IS now in the set, so (3) the SAME-nullifier spend on
the result fails closed — double-spend is impossible at the term level. -/
theorem freshness_guarantee {nf : Nat} {k k' : RecordKernelState}

## Guarantee E — UNFOOLABILITY

*A light client verifying a Q-chain learns A–D for the WHOLE history; re-witnessing nothing.*

This is the apex that COMPOSES A–D over an entire history and hands them to a verifier who
runs nothing but `verify agg.root`.

DAG:
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history` — THE headline:
    checking ONLY `verify agg.root` (re-witnessing NOTHING) ⇒ every turn executed correctly,
    correctly ordered, and the final root is a genuine fold. Proofs-as-additive-attestation.
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.attested_history_conserves` — the whole attested history
    conserves (guarantee B, lifted to the full run).
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` — the ANTI-GHOST: a
    reordered chain forces `ChainBound = False`, so no verifying aggregate exists.
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.leaf_pairing_defeats_swap` — positional pairing means a
    verifying leaf is not re-pointable to a different step.
  • `Distributed.HistoryAggregation.wellformed_attests_whole_history` — the IVC fold model:
    the seam tooth `new_root[i] = old_root[i+1]` pins the whole history; `root_tooth_pins_state`
    is the CR recovery (a light client seeing only roots learns state continuity).
  • `Circuit.Argus.Aggregate.argus_strand_light_client` + `tampered_argus_strand_rejected` —
    the Argus-strand realization of the same case on the executable term IR.

Floor: FRI / STARK soundness (`EngineSound.recursive_sound`, the ONE recursion obligation),
Poseidon2-CR (`recStateCommit` binds the seam roots), ed25519 (strand-block signatures),
PostGSTProgress (a FINALIZED — not merely valid — chain, via the finality-cert leg).
=========================================================================== -/

/-- **`unfoolability_guarantee` heading anchor.** The substantive apex
`RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history` carries the `EngineSound` bundle
(the three named, realizable FRI/circuit soundness hypotheses) plus the aggregate; re-stating
its full signature here would duplicate the module. The load-bearing certification is the
re-pin of that theorem (and its anti-ghost teeth) below; this anchor records that E is the
COMPOSITION of A–D over the whole history handed to a `verify agg.root`-only client. -/

## Guarantee R — THE RUNNING ENTRY (A∧B∧C hold over what the node actually runs)

The five guarantees above are stated over the abstract kernel: the `List Auth` attenuation
lattice (A), the multi-asset ledger `recTransferBal` (B), the Argus term IR (C/D), the
aggregation fold (E). The honest question ember keeps pressing is: *do those guarantees hold
over the executor the deployed node INVOKES* — `execFullForestG`, the body behind the
`dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` FFI export (`Exec.FFI`), the one `produce_via_lean` /
`lean_shadow` call? They do, and this section proves it in ONE statement rather than leaving
it as a reader's inference.

`execFullForestG` is the credential-and-caveat-GATED whole-forest step. The gate is NOT a new
trust premise: it is discharged by `gateOK` (credential-valid ∧ cap-authority ∧
caveats-discharged), and the linear guarantees ride the `eraseG` bridge
(`execFullForestG_erases`) onto the EXISTING ungated `FullForest` theorems — so the gate ADDS
teeth (a forged credential / unauthorized cap / false caveat ⇒ `none`, the whole forest
rejects) without WEAKENING conservation or non-amplification. Floor: unchanged from A–C.

/-- **`running_entry_sound` (NEW aggregation, over the RUNNING entry).** For the gated
whole-forest step `execFullForestG` — the body behind the `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` FFI
the node invokes — a single committed run discharges, in one statement, the three local
guarantees over the THING THAT RUNS:

  * **B (conservation):** an asset `b` whose per-asset net is `0` has its total supply
    (`recTotalAsset`) exactly preserved across the gated forest — conservation
    survives the credential+caveat gate.
  * **A (no amplification):** EVERY delegation edge of the forest is non-amplifying
    (`capAuthConferred (attenuate ·) ⊆ capAuthConferred ·`) — Granovetter survives the gate.
  * **C (per-node attestation):** every node, at every nesting depth, attests
    `gatedActionInvG` — credential passed the §8 oracle ∧ caveats discharged on its pre-state
    ∧ cap-authority ∧ the per-asset/chain/kind obligation. Credential-blindness eliminated.

The body is exactly the three `execFullForestG_*` keystones conjoined — no new mathematics,
the POINT is the subject: this is A/B/C over `execFullForestG`, not over the abstract kernel.

## Axiom-hygiene coverage note

This file is the *reading* artifact: it pins the FIVE guarantee apexes and the keystones
that directly discharge them, organized BY GUARANTEE. It deliberately imports only the
specific keystone modules each guarantee references (not the root `Dregg2`, which would be a
circular import since the root imports this file), so it is NOT — and is not intended to be —
the corpus-wide axiom-hygiene net.

The comprehensive corpus-wide `#assert_axioms` net (every keystone the corpus advertises,
re-pinned transitively through the root `Dregg2`) lives in `Dregg2.Claims`, which imports the
root and therefore can pin keystones in modules this file does not import. `Dregg2.Claims` is
RETIRED as a chronological journal (it is no longer the assurance artifact — this file is) but
RETAINED as that whole-corpus CI pin-net: its ~190 pins are the unique location of those
per-keystone kernel-clean certifications. Retiring it to a doc-only stub would silently drop
that coverage, so it is kept as a pure pin-ledger and re-headed to point here.

Division of labor:
  * **This file (`AssuranceCase`)** — the load-bearing assurance APEX, by guarantee. The five
    guarantee aggregations + their direct-DAG keystones, kernel-triple clean.
  * **`Claims`** — the comprehensive per-keystone CI net (corpus-wide), subordinate to this file.
  * **`scripts/no-sorry-metatheory.sh`** — the textual whole-corpus zero-`sorry` grep.
