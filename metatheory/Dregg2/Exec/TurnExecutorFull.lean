# Dregg2.Exec.TurnExecutorFull — WIDENING the replacement executor to the FULL dregg1 op-set.

`Exec/TurnExecutor.lean`'s `execTurn` runs dregg1's call-forest of catalog-typed *balance/effect*
`Action`s as an all-or-nothing transaction, step-complete by construction (`execTurn_attests`: the
four `StepInv` conjuncts over the whole multi-`Action` turn). But dregg1's turn-executor does MORE
than balance/effect moves: it also runs **authority ops** (grant/revoke caps — the Granovetter
delegate / target-revoke) and **supply ops** (mint/burn — the only ops that legitimately move the
conserved total). For the replacement to SUBSUME every dregg1 turn kind, it must cover those too.

This module widens the executor. We introduce a single sum

  `FullAction = balance (a `TurnExecutor.Action`)
              | delegate / revoke  (an AUTHORITY turn, via `AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate` /
                                    `recKRevokeTarget`)
              | mint / burn        (a SUPPLY turn, the record-cell refinement of
                                    `Generators.execMint` / `execBurn` over the `balance` FIELD)`

and one executor `execFull : RecChainedState → FullAction → Option RecChainedState`, all over the
SAME content-addressed record world (`RecChainedState` / `recTotal` / `balOf`) that `TurnExecutor`
and `AuthTurn` already share — so the widening is genuinely ONE executor, not three. Each kind is
all-or-nothing (fail-closed gates, `Option`-monad). A whole turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as
a transaction (`execFullTurn`), exactly `execTurn`'s discipline lifted to the wider op-set.

We then PROVE that EVERY kind attests its `StepInv` obligations, packaged as `fullActionInv`:

  * **balance/effect** — Conservation (the `balance` field) ∧ Authority ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance,
    delegated VERBATIM to `recCexec_attests` (the `TurnExecutor` spine, one op);
  * **authority (delegate/revoke)** — the FRAME-FIX: `recTotal` is UNCHANGED (conservation trivially
    preserved — `recKDelegate_frame` / `recKRevokeTarget_frame`), and the cap graph is EDITED per
    `AuthTurn` (`recKDelegate_execGraph` / `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` = `Spec.addEdge`/`removeEdge`
    = `Introduce`/`Revoke` `result`); a delegation is moreover AUTHORIZED (`recKDelegate_grounds`:
    the delegator holds the source edge — "only connectivity begets connectivity");
  * **mint/burn** — the supply MOVES by exactly `±amt` (`recMint_delta` / `recBurn_delta`, the
    record-cell refinement of `Generators.mint_delta`/`burn_delta`) with the
    Generative/Annihilative DISCLOSURE obligation discharged off `CatalogEffects`
    (`g_bridgeMint`/`a_burn` color ⇒ `is_disclosed_non_conservation`), and mint/burn are AUTHORIZED
    (the privileged `mintAuthorizedB` gate — a cell cannot coin its own supply).

The headline `execFull_attests` bundles these per-kind: every committed `FullAction` attests the
relevant `StepInv` content for its kind, so the replacement executor is **step-complete across EVERY
dregg1 turn kind** — not just balance/effect. (`fullActionInv` is never weakened: each kind carries
exactly its sound obligations, with conservation tracked EXACTLY — `0` for balance/authority, `±amt`
for mint/burn — via the `ledgerDelta` book-keeping, the executable shadow of dregg1's per-domain
`excess`.)

Discipline (REORIENT §6): no `axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`. `#assert_axioms` on every
keystone. Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Reuses `TurnExecutor`/`AuthTurn`/`Generators`/
`CatalogEffects`/`RecordKernel`; edits none. Verified standalone:

/-! ## §1 — Record-cell MINT/BURN: the supply generators over the `balance` FIELD.

`Exec/Generators.lean` proves `execMint`/`execBurn` over the *scalar* `KernelState` (`bal : CellId →
ℤ`, measure `total`). The full executor lives in the *record* world (`RecordKernelState`, measure
`recTotal` over the `balance` field). So we re-found the two supply generators here over the record
cell — the EXACT analog of `Generators` but writing the named `balance` field via `setBalance` —
reusing `Generators.mintAuthorizedB` (the privileged `node`/`control` gate; bare ownership is NOT
enough to coin supply) and `Kernel.sum_indicator` (the single-point-sum technique). -/

/-- Credit cell `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` (record-cell mint write). Touches only `cell`'s
record (and only its `balance` field — every other field of the content-addressed record survives,
by `setBalance`); every other cell is untouched. -/

/-- **Executable record-cell mint.** Fail-closed: credits `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` only
when the actor is authorized to mint over `cell` (`mintAuthorizedB` — a `node`/`control` cap, NOT
mere ownership), the amount is non-negative, and `cell` is a live account. The record-cell

  else
    none

/-- **Executable record-cell burn.** Fail-closed: debits `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` only when
authorized, the amount is non-negative and available (`amt ≤ balOf (cell)`), and `cell` is live. The

/-! ## §2 — The DISCLOSURE obligation for mint/burn (the Generative/Annihilative gate).

A supply move legitimately breaks `Σδ = 0`, but its delta is FORCED into the receipt — the
`is_disclosed_non_conservation` obligation `CatalogEffects` proves of the Generative
(`bridgeMint`/mint) and Annihilative (`burn`) colors. We tie each record-cell supply op to its
catalog color so the disclosure obligation is discharged for the executable op, not just abstractly.
-/

/-- A `mint`'s catalog effect kind (dregg1's `Effect::BridgeMint` — Generative). -/
def mintEffect : EffectKind := .bridgeMint

/-- A `burn`'s catalog effect kind (dregg1's `Effect::Burn` — Annihilative). -/
def burnEffect : EffectKind := .burn

/-- **Mint discloses — PROVED.** The mint effect is Generative, hence carries the disclosed
non-conservation obligation: its supply delta must be revealed in the receipt. Discharged off
`CatalogEffects.generative_discloses` + `g_bridgeMint`. -/

  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.generative_discloses mintEffect Dregg2.CatalogEffects.g_bridgeMint

/-- **Burn discloses — PROVED.** The burn effect is Annihilative, hence disclosed: its destroyed
amount must be revealed. Discharged off `CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses` + `a_burn`. -/

  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses burnEffect Dregg2.CatalogEffects.a_burn

theorem burn_regime_disclosed : effectObligation burnEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl

/-! ## §3 — Authority turns lifted to `RecChainedState` (the chained delegate / revoke).

`AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate`/`recKRevokeTarget` edit `RecordKernelState.caps`. To run them inside the
unified chained executor we lift each onto `RecChainedState`, threading the receipt chain exactly as
`recCexec` does (newest move first), but carrying an authority "move" marker rather than a balance
`Turn`. The conserved measure is FIXED across an authority turn (the dual frame). -/

/-- A synthetic receipt marker for an authority turn (a self-`Turn` on the actor, amount `0`), so the
authority edit lands a row on the SAME receipt chain (`List Turn`) as balance/supply ops. It carries
no balance delta (`amt := 0`) — the chain entry records THAT an authority edit happened, while the
graph change itself is proven separately (`AuthTurn`'s `execGraph` match). -/
def authReceipt (actor : CellId) : Turn := { actor := actor, src := actor, dst := actor, amt := 0 }

/-- **Chained delegate.** Run `recKDelegate`; on commit, append an authority receipt. -/

  | none    => none

/-- **Chained RIGHTS-CARRYING delegate.** Run `recKDelegateAtten` (the faithful `apply_introduce`:
gate on the delegator holding a cap to `t`, then grant `recipient` the delegator's held cap to `t`
ATTENUATED to `keep` — REAL rights `⊆` held, `recKDelegateAtten_non_amplifying`, stricter than the
unattenuated held-cap copy of `recKDelegate`); on commit, append an authority receipt. Balance-NEUTRAL: edits
ONLY `caps` (`recKDelegateAtten_frame`), so `ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for every asset. -/

/-- **Chained revoke.** `recKRevokeTarget` always commits (revocation only subtracts authority);
append an authority receipt. -/
def recCRevoke (s : RecChainedState) (holder t : CellId) : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel := recKRevokeTarget s.kernel holder t, log := authReceipt holder :: s.log }

/-- **Chained mint.** Run `recKMint`; on commit, append a supply receipt (a self-`Turn` carrying the
minted `amt` as its `balance_change` — the disclosed delta on the chain). -/
def recCMint (s : RecChainedState) (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ) : Option RecChainedState :=
  match recKMint s.kernel actor cell amt with
  | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := { actor := actor, src := cell, dst := cell, amt := amt } :: s.log }
  | none    => none

/-- **Chained burn.** Run `recKBurn`; on commit, append a supply receipt carrying `-amt`. -/
def recCBurn (s : RecChainedState) (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ) : Option RecChainedState :=

  | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := { actor := actor, src := cell, dst := cell, amt := -amt } :: s.log }
  | none    => none

/-! ## §4 — `FullAction` and `execFull`: ONE executor over the FULL op-set. -/

/-- **The FULL dregg1 op-set, as one sum.** A single `FullAction` is one of:
  * `balance a` — a catalog-typed balance/effect `Action` (dregg1's `Action`; runs via `recCexec`);
  * `delegate delegator recipient t` — a Granovetter authority grant (runs via `recKDelegate`);
  * `revoke holder t` — a target revocation (runs via `recKRevokeTarget`);
  * `mint actor cell amt` / `burn actor cell amt` — the privileged supply generators.
This widens `TurnExecutor.Action` (balance/effect only) to subsume EVERY dregg1 turn kind. -/
inductive FullAction where
  /-- A catalog-typed balance/effect action (dregg1's `Action`). -/
  | balance  (a : Action)
  /-- A Granovetter delegation: `delegator` hands `recipient` connectivity to `t`. -/

  /-- A privileged supply mint: credit `cell`'s `balance` by `amt`. -/

  /-- A privileged supply burn: debit `cell`'s `balance` by `amt`. -/
  | burn     (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ)

/-- **The ledger delta of a `FullAction`** — its exact effect on the conserved `recTotal`. Balance,
authority (delegate/revoke), are conservation-trivial (`0`); mint adds `amt`, burn subtracts. The

/-- **The full executor.** Dispatch each `FullAction` kind to its (reused, already-proven) chained

/-! ## §MA — The PER-ASSET full turn executor (the `CONSERVATION_VECTOR` wired into a transaction).

§4–§10 conserve ONE scalar (`recTotal`, the `balance` field). The genuine per-asset law
(`RecordKernel.recKExecAsset_conserves_per_asset`, §MULTI-ASSET) lives over `RecordKernelState.bal`.
Here we build the full-turn executor over THAT ledger — `balanceA`/`delegate`/`revoke`/`mintA`/`burnA`
— and prove the all-or-nothing transaction moves `recTotalAsset b` by EXACTLY the net per-asset
ledger delta, for EVERY asset `b` independently. This is the executable turn whose FFI export
(`dregg_exec_full_turn`) conserves PER-ASSET (`DREGG2-GAP-MAP.md FILL 1`), not the scalar. The
`delegate`/`revoke` kinds are REUSED verbatim (`recCDelegate`/`recCRevoke`); authority is

/-! ### §MA-supply — ACCOUNT-GROWTH on the per-asset dispatch: `createCell` (born EMPTY) + `spawn`.

dregg1's `Effect::CreateCell` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:748`) is the PRIVILEGED creation of a FRESH
cell, born with `balance == 0` (`apply.rs:757` rejects `CreateCellNonZeroBalance`) — so on the per-asset
ledger it is conservation-NEUTRAL (`ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset). `Effect::SpawnWithDelegation`
(`apply.rs` / `EffectsSupply.spawnStep`) is `createCell` PLUS a delegated parent cap to the spawned child:
the spawner must already hold a live edge to `target`, and the child receives THAT concrete held cap.
The create leg is neutral and the cap copy is bal-orthogonal, so spawn is neutral too. We reuse the
`EffectsSupply` creation gate (`mintAuthorizedB` — creation is privileged supply — AND the freshness gate
`newCell ∉ accounts`), but add the parent-edge premise so child creation cannot manufacture authority to
an unrelated target. The account growth lives in `RecordKernel.createCellIntoAsset` (grow `accounts` +
RESET the fresh `bal` column to `0`), so neutrality is PROVED via `recTotalAsset_insert_fresh`, NOT
assumed. -/

/-- **`createCellChainA` — `CreateCell`'s per-asset chained semantics.** Fail-closed: an authorized
creator (`mintAuthorizedB actor newCell` — creation coins a fresh cell, privileged like mint) AND a FRESH
id (`newCell ∉ accounts`, the exact `hfresh` the conservation lemma consumes). On commit, insert the fresh

/-! ### §MA-factory — `CreateCellFromFactory` (dregg1 `apply_create_cell_from_factory`, `apply.rs:3112`).

`CreateCellFromFactory` is `CreateCell` PLUS the factory's published contract: validate the factory
exists in the registry and the creation is within its declared constraints (`validate_and_record`,
`apply.rs:3140`), then mint a cell carrying the factory's initial fields, program VK, AND — the
load-bearing part — the factory's `slotCaveats` (its `program`, `apply.rs:3197`+), which the executor
then enforces on EVERY later `SetField`. Like `CreateCell`, the cell is born `balance == 0`
(`apply.rs:757` rejects nonzero balance) — conservation-NEUTRAL — but the CONSTRAINTS are the point:
the minted cell carries its lifetime invariants from birth, so a `nameservice`/`subscription` cell is
*registered-forever / monotone-head* the instant it exists. -/

/-- The factory's `programVk` field name (the installed VK hash slot, `apply.rs:3197`). -/
def factoryVkField : FieldName := "factory_program_vk"

/-- Write the factory's declared INITIAL fields `(field, value)` onto a cell record (a left fold of
named-field writes; the LAST write to a repeated field wins). Touches only the named fields — the
`balance` field is left at its born-`0` value (dregg1 forbids nonzero balance at creation). -/

Fail-closed in lock-step with dregg1's `apply_create_cell_from_factory`:

  2. its declared initial state must CONFORM to its own caveats (`FactoryEntry.conforms` — a factory
     cannot publish initial fields that already violate the invariants it claims, `validate_and_record`);
  3. the creator must hold privileged creation authority + the id must be fresh (reuses
     `createCellChainA`'s exact `mintAuthorizedB ∧ ∉ accounts` gate, `apply.rs:3179`/:757).
On commit: mint the fresh EMPTY cell (`createCellChainA`), write the factory's initial fields + the
program-VK slot, and INSTALL the factory's `slotCaveats` onto the minted cell — so its published
invariants are enforced for life. Balance-NEUTRAL (born `0`; initial fields are non-`balance` slots). -/

/-! ### §MA-state — the 5 PURE-STATE (field/log) effects on the per-asset dispatch.

dregg1's `turn/src/executor/apply.rs` runs FIVE effects that write the cell-RECORD (a named field)
or the LOG, and NEVER touch the per-asset `bal` ledger:

  * `SetField { cell, index, value }` (`apply_set_field` ~:497) — a state-slot write, gated by the
    `idx < STATE_SLOTS` bound + (for a cross-cell target) the `SetState` permission;
  * `EmitEvent { cell, event }` (`apply_emit_event` ~:703) — a journal append, gated ONLY by
    cell-existence (NO authority/cross-cell check — the integrity-free observation move);
  * `IncrementNonce { cell }` (`apply_increment_nonce` ~:719) — a monotone counter bump, gated by
    the `IncrementNonce` permission (cross-cell);
  * `SetPermissions { cell, new_permissions }` (`apply_set_permissions` ~:775) — the permission
    snapshot write, gated by the `SetPermissions` permission (dregg1 applies it LAST off the ORIGINAL
    permission snapshot — see the per-effect `stateAuthB` gate below);
  * `SetVerificationKey { cell, new_vk }` (`apply_set_verification_key` ~:803) — the VK-field write,
    gated by `SetVerificationKey` permission (the VK hash-integrity check is a §8 Prop-carrier
    portal, off this executable layer).

ALL FIVE carry `Effect::linearity ∈ {Neutral, Monotonic}` (`EffectsState §7`: `setField`/`emitEvent`/
`setPermissions`/`setVerificationKey` Neutral; `incrementNonce` Monotonic) — the NON-balance regime.
Their per-asset semantics are ALREADY proven in `Exec/EffectsState.lean` (`stateStep` + the
neutrality lemmas): the chained `stateStep` writes ONLY `kernel.cell` (a named field) + appends a
receipt, leaving `kernel.bal` and `kernel.accounts` literally untouched. So their `ledgerDeltaAsset`
is `0` for EVERY asset and `recTotalAsset` is UNCHANGED — balance-NEUTRALITY, proved (not assumed)
below. Here we WIRE those proven steps into the executed `execFullA` dispatch (we do NOT re-prove the
per-effect semantics). -/

/-- **Balance-NEUTRALITY of a field write over the per-asset ledger — PROVED (the load-bearing
keystone for the 5 pure-state effects).** `EffectsState.writeField` updates ONLY the record map
`cell` of the kernel; it touches NEITHER `bal` NOR `accounts`. So `recTotalAsset` (= `∑ c ∈
accounts, bal c b`) is LITERALLY UNCHANGED for EVERY asset `b`. THIS is what makes the 5 pure-state
effects per-asset conservation-trivial: a `nonce`/`status`/`permissions`/`vk` write cannot move ANY
asset's supply. (Contrast `recBalCredit_recTotalAsset`, which DOES move `bal` — these effects never
write `bal`.) -/
theorem writeField_recTotalAsset (k : RecordKernelState) (f : FieldName) (target : CellId)
    (v : Value) (b : AssetId) : recTotalAsset (writeField k f target v) b = recTotalAsset k b := by

/-- **Balance-NEUTRALITY of a committed `stateStep` over the per-asset ledger — PROVED.** A committed
`EffectsState.stateStep` (the chained field-write the 5 pure-state effects run) leaves `recTotalAsset
b` UNCHANGED for EVERY asset `b`: it writes a named record field, never the `bal` ledger. The
per-asset analog of `EffectsState.state_conserves` (which preserved the scalar `recTotal`); here it
holds for the asset VECTOR with NO side-condition on the field name (a write to ANY field, even
`balance`, leaves the `bal` ledger fixed — the `bal` ledger is independent of the `cell` record). -/

/-- **Balance-NEUTRALITY of a committed CAVEAT-GATED write over the COMBINED per-asset measure —
PROVED.** The slot-caveat gate (`EffectsState.stateStepGuarded`) commits EXACTLY the underlying
`stateStep` post-state (`stateStepGuarded_eq`), which writes a named record field and never the
`bal` ledger / `escrows` holding-store — so `recTotalAssetWithEscrow b` is UNCHANGED for EVERY asset.
The per-asset analog the `setFieldA` conservation arm reuses now that `setFieldA` routes through the
caveat gate (dregg1 `apply_set_field` → `RecordProgram::evaluate`). -/

/-- **The `EmitEvent` raw chained step — log-only, authority-FREE (dregg1 `apply_emit_event` ~:703).**
Unlike the field-writing effects, `EmitEvent` runs NO authority/cross-cell check (in dregg1 the only
gate is cell-existence) and writes NO state — it appends an event receipt to the chain and nothing
else. We model the observation faithfully: a self-`Turn` receipt (amount `0`) carrying the event,
with the kernel UNCHANGED (so `bal`/`cell`/`caps`/`accounts` are all fixed). The `topic`/`data`
ride the receipt's `src`/`dst` as the event payload markers. The concrete `execFullA` branch gates
this raw append on `cell ∈ accounts`. -/

/-! ### §MA-seal — the 6 SIMPLE bal-neutral effects (Wave 6) on the per-asset dispatch.

dregg1's `turn/src/executor/apply.rs` runs a cluster of SIMPLE effects that flip a cell flag, write a
metadata field, or record a receipt/refusal — and NEVER touch the per-asset `bal` ledger. Each is
balance-NEUTRAL (`ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset, `recTotalAsset` UNCHANGED), modeled FAITHFULLY
as a `stateStep` field-write (the SAME already-proven authority-gated record write the 5 pure-state
effects use) — the STATE move is real (a flag/marker/lifecycle field genuinely changes), while the §8
CRYPTO is an HONEST portal carried at the chain layer, NEVER proved sound here:

  * `Seal { pair_id, capability }` (`apply_seal` ~:2743) — store a sealed box (an AEAD ciphertext of a
    held cap). The STATE move is the record write; the AEAD itself is the §8 CryptoPortal. Authority:
    the actor holds the sealer cap over its cell (modeled as `stateAuthB actor cell` — the c-list read).
    Catalog: `Generative` (it generates a fresh sealed box).
  * `Unseal { sealed_box, recipient }` (`apply_unseal` ~:2874) — reveal the capability UNDER the §8 AEAD
    portal (the decrypt verify is the §8 carrier, NOT proved sound). The STATE move is the reveal record.
    Authority: holds the unsealer cap (`stateAuthB`). Catalog: `Generative`.
  * `CreateSealPair { sealer_holder, unsealer_holder }` (`apply_create_seal_pair` ~:2675) — establish a
    seal keypair (dregg1 grants sealer/unsealer caps; the AEAD KEYPAIR is the §8 portal). The STATE move
    is the metadata write recording the pair into the sealer-holder's record. Authority: `stateAuthB
    actor sealerHolder` (write to the holder's record). Catalog: `Generative`.
  * `MakeSovereign { cell }` (`apply_make_sovereign` ~:3084) — convert a cell to commitment-only
    (sovereign) REPRESENTATION. ASSESSED bal-neutral: dregg1's `ledger.make_sovereign` flips the HOSTING
    representation flag and PRESERVES balance/state/history (NO value moves into commitment-form on the
    per-asset ledger — it is a representation move, not an escrow). Modeled as the `stateStep` flag write.
    Authority: dregg1 requires `cell == action_target` (self-sovereign) ⇒ the cell's own authority
    (`stateAuthB actor cell`). Catalog: `Terminal` (one-way; no inverse). The commitment binding is the
    §8 portal at the chain layer (exactly as bridgeMint's foreign finality).
  * `Refusal { cell, … }` (`apply_refusal` ~:4114) — record a refusal witness: bump the nonce and write
    the refusal commitment into the audit field; dregg1 NEVER mutates balance/caps/value. bal-NEUTRAL.
    Authority: dregg1 gates a CROSS-cell refusal on `SetState` (modeled `stateAuthB actor cell`).
    Catalog: `Monotonic` (the nonce bump).
  * `ReceiptArchive { prefix_end_height, checkpoint }` (`apply_receipt_archive` ~:4441) — archive/prune
    the receipt-chain prefix: transition lifecycle to `Archived` (the cell stays live) + bind the
    checkpoint. A LOG/field operation; bal-NEUTRAL. Authority: dregg1 requires the checkpoint cell_id =
    action_target (`stateAuthB actor cell`). Catalog: `Terminal`.

ALL SIX route through `EffectsState.stateStep` (the ALREADY-PROVEN authority-gated field write), so
their per-asset balance-NEUTRALITY is PROVED off `writeField_recTotalAsset`/`stateStep_recTotalAsset`
(exactly as `setFieldA`/`incrementNonceA`/`setPermissionsA`/`setVKA`) — we do NOT re-prove the per-effect
step. The catalog COLORING (the faithful-mirror tripwire) is carried in the `fullActionInvA`
`KindObligation` per effect. -/

/-- The record fields the 5 simple field-writing bal-neutral effects target (the metatheory's
named-field model of dregg1's `sealed_box` store / `field[4]` refusal-audit slot / `lifecycle`).
The STATE move writes these; the §8 crypto (AEAD ciphertext) lives in the portal. (`MakeSovereign`
is NOT a field write but a whole-record VALUE-REBIND — FILL #133 below, `makeSovereignStep` — so it
has no field name; its commitment lands in `commitmentField`, not a `sovereign` flag.) -/
def sealField      : FieldName := "sealed_box"
def unsealField    : FieldName := "unsealed"
def sealPairField  : FieldName := "seal_pair"
def refusalField   : FieldName := "refusal"
def lifecycleField : FieldName := "lifecycle"

/-! ### §MA-sovereign (FILL #133) — `MakeSovereign` is a VALUE-REBIND, not a flag.

The wave-6 model wrote `sovereign := 1` (a status flag) and LEFT the cell's full record readable.
That is NOT what dregg1's `apply_make_sovereign` → `Ledger::make_sovereign` (`cell/src/ledger.rs:1014`)
does:

```rust
pub fn make_sovereign(&mut self, id: &CellId) -> Result<Cell, LedgerError> {
    let cell = self.cells.remove(id)?;              // the host DROPS the readable cell
    let commitment = cell.state_commitment();        // … and keeps ONLY a 32-byte commitment
    self.sovereign_commitments.insert(*id, commitment);
    self.dirty = true;
    Ok(cell)
}
```

The cell's full state is **REMOVED** from the host-readable `cells` map and **REPLACED** by a
commitment-only representation in `sovereign_commitments`. The host can no longer read the cell's
value/balance/nonce/permissions directly — to learn anything it must OPEN the commitment behind the
§8 CryptoPortal (the federation stores only the 32-byte hash; the sovereign agent holds the preimage).
That is the whole point of "making a cell sovereign": its state moves off the host and behind a
commitment. A flag write models NONE of this — the value stays right there, readable.

We re-model the value-rebind faithfully: `makeSovereignStep` REPLACES `target`'s entire `cell` record
with the commitment-only record `[(commitmentField, .dig (stateCommitment v))]`, where `v` is the
pre-state value and `stateCommitment` is the deterministic §8 hash (`cell.state_commitment()`). The
host-readable scalar fields (`balance`, `nonce`, …) become `none` (no longer directly readable — the
teeth, `makeSovereignStep_balance_unreadable`), while the commitment IS present and binds the preimage
(`makeSovereignStep_commitment_present`/`_binds_preimage`). It stays bal-NEUTRAL **on the per-asset
ledger**: `recTotalAsset`/`recTotalAssetWithEscrow` read `k.bal`/`k.escrows`, which are independent of
`k.cell` — so a value-rebind that touches ONLY `k.cell` cannot move any asset's supply (the SAME
`rfl`-grade conservation `writeField_recTotalAsset` enjoys, since it too touches only `k.cell`). The
commitment binding (collision-resistance of `state_commitment`) is the §8 chain-layer portal — NOT
proved sound here; what IS proved is the value-rebind itself: the readable state is genuinely gone. -/

/-- The field carrying the post-rebind state commitment (dregg1's `sovereign_commitments[id]` slot,
a 32-byte `cell.state_commitment()`). The commitment-only record carries EXACTLY this field. -/
def commitmentField : FieldName := "commitment"

/-- **`stateCommitment v`** — the metatheory's model of dregg1's `cell.state_commitment()`
(`cell/src/commitment.rs`): a DETERMINISTIC hash of the cell's FULL state into a digest tag. The
exact hash is the §8 CryptoPortal (collision-resistance ASSUMED, not proved); all the value-rebind
needs is that it is a *function of the whole pre-state value* (so distinct pre-states give distinct
commitment records — witnessed by the `#eval`s). A simple structural Gödel-style fold suffices for
the model: leaves hash to small tags, records fold their (field-position, sub-hash) pairs. -/

/-- **`sovereignRebind cell target`** — REPLACE `target`'s entire cell with the commitment-only
record `[(commitmentField, .dig (stateCommitment (cell target)))]`. The faithful kernel-level model of
`cells.remove(id)` + `sovereign_commitments.insert(id, cell.state_commitment())`: the readable record
is GONE; only the commitment remains. Every other cell untouched. (Contrast `writeField`, which keeps
the record and edits ONE field — the wave-6 flag model. THIS drops the whole record.) -/

/-- **`makeSovereignKernel k target`** — apply the value-rebind to the record kernel: the `cell`
function is replaced by `sovereignRebind`; `bal`/`accounts`/`caps`/`escrows`/side-tables ALL fixed

Fail-closed: commits only when the actor holds authority over `target` (dregg1's self-sovereign gate
`cell == action_target` ⇒ the cell's own authority, `stateAuthB`). On commit, REBIND `target` into
commitment-form (the readable state is dropped behind the §8 commitment) and extend the receipt chain
by one row (the metadata clock). NO `bal` move, NO cap edit — the regime invariant. -/

/-! ### §MA-auth — the 6 DISTINCT AUTHORITY effects on the per-asset dispatch.

dregg1's `turn/src/executor/apply.rs` runs a cluster of capability-graph effects BEYOND the bare
`delegate`/`revoke` already wired above. Each EDITS (or merely CHECKS) the `caps` cap-graph and
NEVER the `bal` ledger — so `ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset and `recTotalAsset` is UNCHANGED
(balance-NEUTRAL). The HEADLINE obligation for this cluster is NON-AMPLIFICATION — the genuine
`capAuthConferred ⊆` over the REAL `List Auth` lattice (`attenuate_subset`), not a `()≤()` collapse.

  * `Introduce { introducer, recipient, target }` — the graph skeleton of the 3-party Granovetter
    introduce. Reuses the proven `recCDelegate` connectivity spine and copies the concrete held cap.
    The rights-carrying/narrowing form is `delegateAttenA` below.
  * `AttenuateCapability { cell, slot, narrower_permissions }` (`apply.rs:4377`) — monotonically
    NARROW a held cap in the actor's c-list (widening rejected). The purest non-amplification.
  * `DropRef { ref_id }` (`apply.rs:4034`) — a CapTP GC decrement: the holder drops its edge to the
    target. Reuses `recKRevokeTarget` (`removeEdge`); authority strictly shrinks.
  * `RevokeDelegation { child }` (`apply.rs:3044`) — a parent revokes a child's delegation. Reuses
    `recKRevokeTarget` (`removeEdge`). (Distinct dregg1 op from `DropRef`; same graph move.)
  * `ValidateHandoff { … }` (`apply.rs:4069`) — the graph-level consequence of accepting a
    two-signature CapTP handoff certificate. The executable action below carries only
    `(introducer, recipient, target)`, so it can prove the introduce skeleton by copying the held cap.
    The certificate's granted permissions / allowed-effect mask and the genuine
    `granted ⊆ held` check live in `Exec.CapTP.HandoffCert` and the swiss-table path, not in this
    three-field skeleton.
  * `ExerciseViaCapability { cap_slot, inner_effects }` (`apply.rs:2441`) — exercise a HELD cap. The
    cap graph is UNCHANGED (only connectivity begets connectivity); gated on holding the edge.

These REUSE the proofs of `Exec.EffectsAuthority` (which we cannot import — it sits DOWNSTREAM of
this module — so we re-found the two missing chained wrappers `attenuateStepA`/`exerciseStepA` here,
mirroring `recCDelegate`, and discharge the non-amplification directly from `Caps.attenuate_subset`,
the SAME proof `EffectsAuthority.attenuate_non_amplifying`/`introduce_non_amplifying` reuse). -/

/-- **`IsNonAmplifyingF held granted`** — the genuine non-amplification predicate over the REAL

(`granted ⊄ held`) makes it FALSE — the predicate has teeth (`amplifyingF_rejected`). The local twin

dregg1's `apply_cell_seal`/`apply_cell_unseal`/`apply_cell_destroy` (`apply.rs:4218`/`:4251`/`:4283`)
drive the cell's `lifecycle : CellLifecycle` (`cell/src/lifecycle.rs`) through the cell-side primitives
`Cell::seal`/`unseal`/`destroy` (`cell.rs:528`/`:559`/`:583`):

  * `seal`  : Live/Archived → Sealed; REJECT if already Sealed (`AlreadySealed`) or terminal
              (Destroyed/Migrated, `Terminal`). A Sealed cell rejects new effects (`accepts_effects`,
              `lifecycle.rs:109`) but state/history survive — REVERSIBLE quiescence (`cell.rs:533-545`).
  * `unseal`: Sealed → Live; REJECT if NotSealed (`cell.rs:559-565`).
  * `destroy`: any NON-terminal → Destroyed, binding the `DeathCertificate` hash into the FINAL state
              (`cell.rs:587-597`); REJECT if already terminal (`Terminal`). TERMINAL — no further
              transition, and a Destroyed cell rejects every effect.

We model `lifecycle` by its stable discriminant (`0`=Live, `1`=Sealed, `3`=Destroyed; `cell/src/
lifecycle.rs:95`) in `k.lifecycle`, and bind the death-certificate hash in `k.deathCert`. Each is
authority-gated (dregg1 requires `target == action_target` — the self-lifecycle gate — so the cell's own
authority `stateAuthB actor cell`). All balance-NEUTRAL (edit `lifecycle`/`deathCert`, never `bal`). -/

/-! ### §MA-seal (Wave-3 DE-SHADOW) — seal/unseal/createSealPair as REAL capability movement.

The wave-6 model collapsed all three to a field flag (`stateStep s sealField cell (.int 1)`): NO cap ever
moved. dregg1 GENUINELY moves a capability through an AEAD box. We de-shadow:

  * `apply_create_seal_pair` (`apply.rs:2675`): GRANT a sealer cap to `sealerHolder` AND an unsealer cap
    to `unsealerHolder` (the AEAD keypair is the §8 portal; the two c-list grants are REAL). We model the
    sealer/unsealer caps as `endpoint`-to-the-pair caps carrying the `grant` right (so a holder can seal
    /unseal), keyed by the `pairId` — `sealerCap pairId` / `unsealerCap pairId`.
  * `apply_seal` (`apply.rs:2743`): look up the actor's HELD sealer cap (`lookup_by_target`,
    `apply.rs:2756`; fail-closed `CapabilityNotHeld` otherwise), then SEAL a HELD `payload` cap into a box
    keyed by `pairId` (the box BINDS the specific cap). The AEAD ciphertext is the §8 portal; WHICH cap is
    sealed is REAL (the box's `payload`).
  * `apply_unseal` (`apply.rs:2874`): look up the actor's HELD unsealer cap (`apply.rs:2891`), find the box
    by `pairId` (fail-closed if absent), then — under the §8 AEAD-open carrier — GRANT the recovered
    `payload` cap to the `recipient`'s c-list (`apply.rs:2926` `grant_with_breadstuff`). The cap GENUINELY
    MOVES out of the box into the recipient's slot. Only the crypto is portaled.

/-! ### §MA-escrow — the COMBINED PER-ASSET holding-store on the executed dispatch (`META-FILL C`).

dregg1's escrow/obligation/committed-escrow are NOT balance-conserving two-cell transfers: they DEBIT
ONE cell and park the value in an off-ledger side-table, conserving only the COMBINED total across the
create+settle PAIR (`RecordKernel §ESCROW`). On the per-asset `bal` ledger this is
`RecordKernel.createEscrowKAsset`/`releaseEscrowKAsset`/`refundEscrowKAsset`, which conserve the
COMBINED per-asset measure `recTotalAssetWithEscrow`. We re-found their CHAINED wrappers HERE (mirroring
`attenuateStepA`/`exerciseStepA`, since `EffectsPaired` sits parallel and is not imported), and wire
them into the executed `execFullA` dispatch. The escrow legs move the BARE `recTotalAsset` by ∓amount at
the locked asset (`ledgerDeltaAsset`), but conserve the COMBINED measure (`combinedDeltaAsset = 0`).
Note effects move SETS (nullifier/commitment), not `bal`, so both deltas are `0`. -/

discipline, `apply.rs:3592` "On any failure, the journal handles rollback for the entire action"); the
pipeline step DEQUEUES the FIFO head from a source queue (owner-only) and RE-ENQUEUES it into each sink
(ACL-checked — `apply.rs:3812` BUG#114 sink-auth gate). Both ride the SAME proven chained queue kernel
ops (`queueEnqueueDepositK`/`queueDequeueRefundK`/`queueDequeueK`/`queueEnqueueK`), so the FIFO order,
capacity bound, owner gate, and per-asset combined-conservation are INHERITED — NOT re-modelled. -/

shadow of "the Pedersen range/opening proof verified", `apply_create_committed_escrow`'s
`verifier.verify(range_proof, "committed-escrow-range", …)`, dregg1 `apply.rs:2125`). The state move
commits ONLY when `hidingProof = true` — so the committed variant FAIL-CLOSED REQUIRES a hiding
obligation the plain escrow does NOT (a reader sees a DIFFERENT gate; a `#eval` shows

/-! ### §R4 — the EXECUTABLE facet classifier + cap-mask gate for `exerciseA`.

dregg1's `apply_exercise_via_capability` (`apply.rs:2455`) does NOT merely hold-gate: each inner effect
must lie in the held cap's `allowed_effects` FACET MASK (the `read`/`write`/`grant`/`call`/… authority
the cap actually confers). The hold-gate (`confersEdgeTo`) checks *connectivity*; R4 checks the *facet*.
The two are distinct — a `endpoint t [read]` cap (read-only) connects to `t` (so the hold-gate could
pass via a sibling `write` cap) yet must REJECT a `write`/`grant`-facet inner effect. Here we make
`execFullA`'s `exerciseA` ENFORCE the mask (it was hold-gate-only), so `execFullA` is the canonical
semantics the handler agrees with — no weaker. -/

/-- **The facet an inner effect EXERCISES** (the R4 mask key, dregg1 `Effect::required_facet`). Mutating
effects (transfer/mint/burn/state-write/escrow/bridge/queue/note/seal/lifecycle/supply) demand `write`;
authority-granting effects (delegate/introduce/attenuate/dropRef/revoke/validateHandoff/swiss-export)
demand `grant`; a NESTED exercise demands the privileged `control`. A `read`-only cap admits NONE of
these (every dregg2 effect mutates or grants) — the faithful contrast the §TEETH exercise. -/

/-! ## §MB — `execFullTurnA_append` + the per-asset PER-NODE attestation carrier.

The forest lift in `Exec/FullForest.lean` rests on the same `execTurn_append` shape `TurnForest.lean`
uses for the narrow executor — here re-founded for the per-asset `execFullTurnA`. We then build the
per-asset analog of `fullActionInv` (`fullActionInvA`) whose **Ledger** conjunct is the full per-asset
VECTOR (`∀ b, recTotalAsset … = … + ledgerDeltaAsset fa b`, never one aggregate scalar — the FILL-1
no-laundering carrier), with ChainLink/ObsAdvance/KindObligation reused per-kind (these are
asset-orthogonal: they edit the log / `caps`, not the `bal` ledger). `execFullTurnA_each_attests`
then threads the per-node witness along the all-or-nothing fold, so the forest's per-node
attestation (`FullForest.execFullForestA_each_attests`) lifts straight off the bridge. -/

/-- **`execFullTurnA_append` — PROVED.** Running a concatenated per-asset turn equals running the
prefix and, on success, the suffix (the `execTurn_append` shape for `execFullTurnA`). The

**State-dependent for `queueDequeueA`:** the dequeue refund amount is NOT a caller field — it is the
named deposit record's own `amount` (`dequeueRefundAmount s.kernel depId`), read off the PRE-state `s`.
Threading `s` here is what makes the receipt amount UNFORGEABLE (a caller cannot misreport the value it
reclaims). Every other arm ignores `s` (the receipt is a pure function of the action's own fields). -/

/-! ### §MA-queue-batch #eval (WAVE 4) — the ATOMIC cross-queue transaction + the PIPELINE fan-out step
on the executed dispatch. The atomic batch is ALL-OR-NOTHING (a single failing sub-op rolls back the
WHOLE batch); the pipeline step DEQUEUES a source head and RE-ENQUEUES it into each sink (fan-out
routing). Fixture `fmaQ`: actor 0 owns/holds caps over cells {0,1,2}, with THREE queues — source `q=10`
(owner 0, capacity 3, holding the FIFO message `[111]`), sinks `q=11`/`q=12` (owner 0, capacity 3,
EMPTY). All balance-neutral (queues hold messages, not balance). -/

def fmaQ : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel :=
      { accounts := {0, 1, 2}
        cell := fun _ => .record [("balance", .int 0)]
        caps := fun l => if l = 0 then [Cap.node 0, Cap.node 1, Cap.node 2] else []
        bal := fun c a => if c = 0 ∧ a = 0 then 50 else 0

-- ★ ATOMIC BATCH — ALL SUCCEED: enqueue 222 into q=10 (deposit 0) THEN dequeue from q=10 (refund 0).
--   Both sub-ops commit ⇒ the batch COMMITS. (The 222 enqueues to the tail, then the head 111 dequeues.)
#guard ((queueAtomicTxA fmaQ 0
        [ .enqueue 10 222 0 0 0 0 0, .dequeue 10 0 0 9 ]).isSome)  --  true — all-or-nothing COMMITS

-- ★★ ATOMICITY TEETH — ONE FAILING SUB-OP ROLLS BACK ALL: the SAME first enqueue, but the second sub-op
--   dequeues from a NON-EXISTENT queue id 99 (fail-closed). The WHOLE batch is `none` — the first
--   enqueue is ROLLED BACK (no partial commit), exactly dregg1's journal-rollback for the entire action:
#guard ((queueAtomicTxA fmaQ 0
        [ .enqueue 10 222 0 0 0 0 0, .dequeue 99 0 0 0 ]).isSome) == false  --  false — ATOMIC ROLLBACK
-- ...and a failing sub-op FIRST also collapses the batch (the second never runs — the fold short-circuits):
#guard ((queueAtomicTxA fmaQ 0
        [ .dequeue 99 0 0 0, .enqueue 10 222 0 0 0 0 0 ]).isSome) == false  --  false — head failure aborts
-- ...the all-or-nothing is balance-neutral when it commits (the COMBINED measure is FIXED ∀ asset):
#guard ((queueAtomicTxA fmaQ 0 [ .enqueue 10 222 0 0 0 0 0, .dequeue 10 0 0 9 ]).map
        (fun s => (recTotalAssetWithEscrow s.kernel 0, recTotalAssetWithEscrow s.kernel 1))) == some (50, 0)  --  some (50, 0) — CONSERVED

-- ★ PIPELINE STEP — MOVE SOURCE→SINKS: dequeue the head 111 from source q=10 and fan it out into sinks
--   q=11 and q=12. The source LOSES the message (buffer [111] → []); EACH sink GAINS it (buffer [] → [111]):
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 10 0 [1, 2] [11, 12]).isSome)  --  true — routing COMMITS
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 10 0 [1, 2] [11, 12]).map
        (fun s => ((findQueue s.kernel.queues 10).map (·.buffer),
                   (findQueue s.kernel.queues 11).map (·.buffer),
                   (findQueue s.kernel.queues 12).map (·.buffer)))) == some (some [], some [111], some [111])  --  some (some [], some [111], some [111]) — MOVED source→sinks
-- ...the pipeline step is balance-NEUTRAL (the COMBINED measure is FIXED ∀ asset — moves a MESSAGE, not balance):
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 10 0 [1, 2] [11, 12]).map
        (fun s => (recTotalAssetWithEscrow s.kernel 0, recTotalAssetWithEscrow s.kernel 1))) == some (50, 0)  --  some (50, 0) — CONSERVED

-- ★★ PIPELINE TEETH — source EMPTY rejects (the FIFO emptiness gate): route from q=11 (empty) ⇒ `none`:
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 11 0 [2] [12]).isSome) == false  --  false — empty source rejected
-- ...and a SINK the owner does NOT control is rejected (the BUG#114 sink-ACL gate): actor 0 holds no cap
--   to cell 5, so fanning into a sink represented by cell 5 fail-closes:
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 10 0 [5] [11]).isSome) == false  --  false — unauthorized sink rejected
-- ...and a NON-OWNER source dequeue is rejected: cell 1 is not the owner of q=10 ⇒ `none`:
#guard ((queuePipelineStepA fmaQ 10 1 [1] [11]).isSome) == false  --  false — non-owner source rejected

-- ★ PIPELINED-SEND — the apply-time NEUTRAL marker (the EventualRef resolution is `ConditionalTurn`'s
--   batch; AT apply the resolved action already ran, so this is a balance-neutral clock row that COMMITS):
#guard ((execFullA fmaQ (.pipelinedSendA 0)).isSome)  --  true — apply-time neutral commits
#guard ((execFullA fmaQ (.pipelinedSendA 0)).map
        (fun s => (recTotalAssetWithEscrow s.kernel 0, s.log.length))) == some (50, 1)  --  some (50, 1) — NEUTRAL + one clock row
