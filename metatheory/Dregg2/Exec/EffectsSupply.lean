# Dregg2.Exec.EffectsSupply — the disclosed-supply and generative-resource effects, fully characterized.

Sibling of `Exec/EffectTransfer.lean` (`Conservative`/`Paired` reference) and of
`Exec/TurnExecutorFull.lean`'s mint/burn (the `Disclosed` supply prototype). Each effect here is
proved against the same five-keystone pattern:

  1. **executable step** — concrete, `#eval`-able semantics over `RecChainedState`;
  2. **conserves** — the domain-level conservation/disclosure obligation. For disclosed-supply
     effects this is NOT `Σδ = 0` but the disclosed form: `recTotal` moves by a disclosed `±amount`,
     flagged `is_disclosed_non_conservation`; for the paired-bridge effects (lock/finalize/cancel)
     it IS `Σδ = 0` (an internal escrow move);
  3. **authorized** — a committed step was gated by the relevant authority;
  4. **metadata** — the receipt chain advances by exactly one row (replay-detectable), and the cap
     table is framed (resource creation/supply never edits connectivity);
  5. **forward-sim** — a committed step is matched by an abstract `Spec` step `AbsStep (absT s)
     (absT s')` over the (`balance`-domain total, authority graph) abstraction, with the disclosed
     supply delta on the bottom edge.

## Effects covered

  * `CreateCell` (`g_createCell`, Generative) — mint a fresh live account with a disclosed
    initial balance: `recTotal` grows by exactly the disclosed `balance`.
  * `CreateCellFromFactory` (`g_createCellFromFactory`, Generative) — `CreateCell` whose child runs
    a published `FactoryDescriptor` program: constructor transparency + the same disclosed-balance creation.
  * `SpawnWithDelegation` (`g_spawnWithDelegation`, Generative) — spawn a child with a disclosed
    copy of an already-held parent cap; `recTotal` grows by the disclosed child balance.
  * `BridgeMint` (`g_bridgeMint`, Generative — §8 portal inflow) — credit a cell by a disclosed
    `value` observed off a foreign chain. dregg2 cannot verify foreign consensus, so the foreign
    finality is a `Prop`-carrier portal `ForeignFinal` carried as a hypothesis (OPEN: discharged
    outside Lean); the local state transition is executable and proved.
  * `BridgeLock` (`c_bridgeLock`, Conservative) — Phase-1 lock: escrow `value` from a cell into a
    bridge lock-cell (an internal `Σδ = 0` move) + record the lock's `nullifier`. The foreign
    destination is a `Prop` portal; the local escrow conserves.
  * `BridgeFinalize` (`a_bridgeFinalize`, Annihilative — disclosed cross-chain OUTFLOW) — Phase-3
    finalize: on a foreign receipt (Prop portal), consume the lock (the nullifier becomes permanently
    spent). The catalog color is `Annihilative` (the value leaves for the other chain — a disclosed
    burn, NOT conserved). This module's LOCAL toy frames the balance (the value already left at lock
    time, so this no-credit step touches the local total by `0`); the value-leaves-now accounting is
    the `Bridge` handler's `bridgeFinalizeKAsset` (`delta = -amount`).
  * `BridgeCancel` (`c_bridgeCancel`, Conservative) — Phase-4 cancel after timeout: refund the
    escrow back to the owner (the inverse of the lock — `Σδ = 0`) + retire the lock nonce.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Reuses only built
modules (`TurnExecutorFull`/`RecordKernel`/`Factory`/`CatalogEffects`/`Spec.ExecRefinement`); edits none.

/-! ## §0 — Shared scaffolding: the disclosed-creation credit, the lock-nullifier nonce, the foreign portal.

The disclosed-supply / generative effects share two named-field moves and one §8 portal:
  * a fresh-account insert (`createCellInto`) that adds a live cell with a disclosed balance — the
    generative analog of `recCreditCell` but it grows `accounts`, so `recTotal` rises by the disclosed
    balance of the new (previously absent ⇒ measure-`0`) cell;
  * a nullifier-nonce write (`setLock` / `lockOf`) recording a bridge lock's spent state (the
    replay-protection metadata for the bridge phases);
  * the foreign-finality portal `ForeignFinal` — an opaque `Prop` the cross-chain proof discharges
    outside Lean (dregg2 cannot verify Cardano consensus). It is carried as a hypothesis on the bridge
    keystones, never proved here (OPEN: §8 portal obligation). -/

/-- **The disclosed bridge-lock field** — a cell record's `bridge_lock` nullifier-nonce field, recording
whether/which note is locked for a cross-chain bridge (the replay-protection metadata of the bridge
phases). Distinct from `balance`, so writing it does not perturb the conserved measure. -/
def lockField : FieldName := "bridge_lock"

/-- Read a cell's `bridge_lock` field as an `Int` (0 = unlocked / no pending bridge), the bridge-phase
metadata measure. -/
def lockOf (v : Value) : Int := (v.scalar lockField).getD 0

/-- **`ForeignFinal`** — the §8 cross-chain finality portal. A `Prop` standing for "the foreign chain
has finalized the corresponding transaction at `nullifier` for `value`". dregg2 cannot verify foreign
consensus inside Lean, so this is an opaque carrier (OPEN: discharged by the BridgeVerifierKernel /
observation bridge): it is a hypothesis on every bridge keystone, never proved here. -/
opaque ForeignFinal (nullifier : ℤ) (value : ℤ) : Prop

/-! ## §1 — `CreateCell`: a Generative effect that mints a fresh live account (disclosed supply).

`Effect::CreateCell` adds a new cell to the ledger with an initial `balance`. It is Generative
(`CatalogEffects.g_createCell`): it brings `balance` units into existence, a disclosed non-conservation
(the created amount is on the receipt). The executable semantics: gate on `mintAuthorizedB` (creation
is privileged — only an authority may coin a new cell's endowment), require the new id is fresh
(`∉ accounts`), then insert it with the disclosed `balance`. -/

/-- Insert a fresh cell `newCell` into the ledger with initial `balance` field `bal` (and a cleared
lock). The generative account-set write: it adds `newCell` to `accounts` AND sets its `balance`. -/
def createCellInto (k : RecordKernelState) (newCell : CellId) (bal : ℤ) : RecordKernelState :=
  { k with accounts := insert newCell k.accounts
           cell := fun c => if c = newCell then setBalance (.record []) bal else k.cell c }

/-- **`createCellStep` — `CreateCell`'s executable semantics.** Fail-closed: an authorized creator
(`mintAuthorizedB actor newCell` — creation is privileged, like minting supply), a fresh id
(`newCell ∉ accounts`), and a non-negative endowment. On commit, the fresh cell is inserted with the
disclosed `bal` and a receipt carrying the disclosed creation amount is appended. -/
def createCellStep (s : RecChainedState) (actor newCell : CellId) (bal : ℤ) :
    Option RecChainedState :=
  if mintAuthorizedB s.kernel.caps actor newCell = true ∧ newCell ∉ s.kernel.accounts ∧ 0 ≤ bal then

def createTurn (actor newCell : CellId) (bal : ℤ) : Turn :=
  { actor := actor, src := newCell, dst := newCell, amt := bal }

/-- **`createCellStep` factors through its gate.** A committed creation implies the three gate
conjuncts held and pins the post-state. The bridge downstream keystones reuse. -/

/-! ### §1.2 — `create_conserves` (disclosed form): `recTotal` grows by exactly the disclosed `bal`. -/

/-- The fresh-account insert raises `recTotal` by exactly the disclosed `bal`. The new cell was
absent (`∉ accounts`, so it contributed `0`); inserting it with `balance = bal` adds `bal`.
Uses `Finset.sum_insert` (the fresh-cell single-point growth). -/

  simp only [if_neg hcne]

/-- **`create_conserves` — disclosed non-conservation.** A committed `createCellStep` raises the
total `balance` by exactly the disclosed `bal`: `recTotal s'.kernel = recTotal s.kernel + bal`. The supply
move is not `Σδ = 0`; it is the disclosed delta `+bal` (the Generative disclosure obligation). -/
theorem create_conserves {s s' : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    (h : createCellStep s actor newCell bal = some s') :
    recTotal s'.kernel = recTotal s.kernel + bal := by
  obtain ⟨_, hfresh, _, hs'⟩ := createCellStep_factors h
  subst hs'
  exact createCellInto_recTotal s.kernel newCell bal hfresh

/-- **`create_discloses`.** `CreateCell` is Generative, so its created supply is disclosed.
Discharged via `CatalogEffects.generative_discloses` + `g_createCell`. -/
theorem create_discloses :
    (effectLinearity .createCell).is_disclosed_non_conservation = true :=
  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.generative_discloses .createCell Dregg2.CatalogEffects.g_createCell

/-- **`create_disclosed_domain`.** The realized balance-domain delta of a committed
`createCellStep` is exactly the disclosed `[bal]` (not `[0]`). -/
theorem create_disclosed_domain {s s' : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    (h : createCellStep s actor newCell bal = some s') :
    [recTotal s'.kernel - recTotal s.kernel] = [bal] := by
  rw [create_conserves h]; simp

/-! ### §1.3 — `create_authorized` + fail-closed. -/

/-- **`create_authorized`.** A committed `createCellStep` implies the creator held
creation authority over the new cell (`mintAuthorizedB` — bare ownership is not enough; creation
coins supply). -/
theorem create_authorized {s s' : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    (h : createCellStep s actor newCell bal = some s') :
    mintAuthorizedB s.kernel.caps actor newCell = true :=
  (createCellStep_factors h).1

/-- **`create_unauthorized_fails` (fail-closed).** Without creation authority, no cell is
minted. The confinement core. -/
theorem create_unauthorized_fails (s : RecChainedState) (actor newCell : CellId) (bal : ℤ)
    (h : mintAuthorizedB s.kernel.caps actor newCell = false) :
    createCellStep s actor newCell bal = none := by
  unfold createCellStep
  rw [if_neg]; rintro ⟨ha, _⟩; rw [h] at ha; exact absurd ha (by simp)

/-! ### §1.4 — `create_metadata`: caps framed + the chain advances by one. -/

/-- **`create_caps_unchanged`.** A committed `createCellStep` leaves the cap table
untouched (creation edits `accounts`/`cell`, never `caps`). -/
theorem create_caps_unchanged {s s' : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    (h : createCellStep s actor newCell bal = some s') :
    s'.kernel.caps = s.kernel.caps := by
  obtain ⟨_, _, _, hs'⟩ := createCellStep_factors h
  subst hs'; rfl

/-- **`create_metadata` (metadata + authority frame).** A committed `createCellStep`: (a) grows
the receipt chain by EXACTLY one row (replay-detectable, ObsAdvance), and (b) leaves the cap table /
reconstructed authority graph UNCHANGED. -/
theorem create_metadata {s s' : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    (h : createCellStep s actor newCell bal = some s') :

/-! ## §2 — `CreateCellFromFactory`: constructor transparency + disclosed creation.

`Effect::CreateCellFromFactory` (`CatalogEffects.g_createCellFromFactory`, Generative) mints a cell
whose lifetime program is a published `FactoryDescriptor`'s program. Composed from
`Factory.createFromFactory` (constructor transparency) with `createCellStep`'s disclosed ledger insert:
the factory pins the child's invariants, the supply move is the disclosed `+bal`. -/

/-- **`createFromFactoryStep` — `CreateCellFromFactory`'s executable semantics.** First mint the child
program/state via `Factory.createFromFactory` (rejects a non-conforming initial value, fail-closed);
THEN insert the fresh ledger account with the disclosed `bal`. Returns BOTH the ledger post-state and the
minted `Factory.Cell` (carrying the published program), so constructor transparency is observable. -/
def createFromFactoryStep (s : RecChainedState) (actor newCell : CellId) (bal : ℤ)
    (d : Factory.FactoryDescriptor) (initial : Value) :
    Option (RecChainedState × Factory.Cell) :=

  | some child =>
      match createCellStep s actor newCell bal with
      | some s' => some (s', child)
      | none    => none
  | none => none

/-- **`factory_create_factors`.** A committed factory-create factors as a committed
`Factory.createFromFactory` (the child) AND a committed `createCellStep` (the ledger insert). -/
theorem factory_create_factors {s : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    {d : Factory.FactoryDescriptor} {initial : Value} {s' : RecChainedState} {child : Factory.Cell}

          obtain ⟨hsl, hch⟩ := h
          exact ⟨by rw [hch], by rw [hsl]⟩

/-- **`factory_constructor_transparency`.** The cell a committed `createFromFactoryStep` mints
carries exactly the factory's declared `program` and conforms to its schema: no hidden behavior, the
published contract is the child's lifetime invariant set. Delegated to `Factory.factory_mints_conforming`. -/
theorem factory_constructor_transparency {s : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    {d : Factory.FactoryDescriptor} {initial : Value} {s' : RecChainedState} {child : Factory.Cell}

  Factory.factory_mints_conforming (factory_create_factors h).1

/-- **`factory_create_conserves` — DISCLOSED non-conservation.** The ledger insert raises
`recTotal` by exactly the disclosed `bal` (inherited from `create_conserves`). -/
theorem factory_create_conserves {s : RecChainedState} {actor newCell : CellId} {bal : ℤ}
    {d : Factory.FactoryDescriptor} {initial : Value} {s' : RecChainedState} {child : Factory.Cell}

    {d : Factory.FactoryDescriptor} {initial : Value} {s' : RecChainedState} {child : Factory.Cell}

/-! ## §3 — `SpawnWithDelegation`: a child spawned with a disclosed parent-cap copy.

`Effect::SpawnWithDelegation` (`CatalogEffects.g_spawnWithDelegation`, Generative) spawns a child cell
that inherits a snapshot of the parent's authority. Modeled as `createCellStep` (the disclosed-supply
child) composed with copying an already-held parent cap to the child. The balance creation is the
disclosed `+bal`; the authority copy adds no ungrounded cap edge. -/

/-- **`spawnStep` — `SpawnWithDelegation`'s executable semantics.** Fail-closed via `createCellStep` (the
authorized, fresh-id, non-negative child) AND unless the actor already holds a live cap edge to the
parent `target`. On commit, copy that concrete held cap to the child, record its parent, and store the
parent's c-list snapshot at birth. The child's provenance is the spawning `actor` (recorded on the
receipt). -/

`Effect::BridgeMint` (`CatalogEffects.g_bridgeMint`, Generative) credits a cell with a value observed
off a foreign chain. dregg2 cannot verify foreign consensus inside Lean, so the foreign finality is the
opaque `Prop` `ForeignFinal nullifier value` carried as a hypothesis (OPEN: §8 portal); the local state
transition — the disclosed `+value` credit + the nullifier-nonce pairing — is executable and proved. -/

/-- **`bridgeMintStep` — `BridgeMint`'s executable local semantics.** Fail-closed: an authorized minter
(`mintAuthorizedB` — the bridge mint is privileged supply), the target is live, and a non-negative value.
On commit, credit the cell's `balance` by the disclosed `value` and append a receipt carrying it. The
foreign finality is not checked here (it is the §8 portal hypothesis on the keystone). -/

/-! ## §5 — `BridgeLock` / `BridgeCancel` / `BridgeFinalize`: the paired bridge escrow phases.

`BridgeLock`/`BridgeCancel`/`BridgeFinalize` are the Conservative escrow phases (`Σδ = 0`). We model a
bridge lock-cell: locking escrows `value` from the owner into the lock-cell (an internal transfer,
balance-conserving) recording the lock nullifier; cancel refunds it (the inverse); finalize consumes the
lock (the value already left — balance framed, the nullifier retired). The foreign destination/receipt is
the §8 Prop portal; the local escrow conserves. Reuses `recTransfer` for lock/cancel. -/

/-- **`bridgeLockStep` — `BridgeLock`'s executable local semantics.** Fail-closed: the owner is
authorized (`authorizedB` over the move), `value` is available in `owner`, and `owner ≠ lockCell`

carrying the `nullifier`. -/

-- CreateCell: actor 9 (holds `node 2`) creates fresh cell 2 with disclosed balance 50 — commits,
-- discloses +50 (105 → 155), grows the chain by one:
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 9 2 50).isSome)  --  true
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 9 2 50).map (fun s => recTotal s.kernel)) == some 155  --  some 155
#guard (recTotal ss0.kernel) == 105  --  105
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 9 2 50).map (fun s => s.log.length)) == some 1  --  some 1
-- ...the fresh cell 2 carries the disclosed balance:
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 9 2 50).map (fun s => balOf (s.kernel.cell 2))) == some 50  --  some 50
-- An unauthorized creator (actor 0 holds no create cap) is rejected (fail-closed):
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 0 2 50).isSome) == false  --  false
-- A non-fresh id (cell 1 already live) is rejected:
#guard ((createCellStep ss0 9 1 50).isSome) == false  --  false

-- SpawnWithDelegation: child creation alone cannot mint authority to an unheld parent target:
#guard ((spawnStep ss0 9 2 1 20).isSome) == false  --  false
-- ...but actor 9 can spawn child 2 (balance 20) with a copy of its held parent `node 0` cap:
#guard ((spawnStep ss0 9 2 0 20).isSome)  --  true
#guard ((spawnStep ss0 9 2 0 20).map (fun s => recTotal s.kernel)) == some 125  --  some 125 (disclosed +20)
-- ...and the child carries the concrete copied parent cap (`node 0`), not a manufactured target cap:
#guard (((spawnStep ss0 9 2 0 20).map (fun s => s.kernel.caps 2)).getD []) == [Cap.node 0]  --  [Cap.node 0]
#guard ((spawnStep ss0 9 2 0 20).map
        (fun s => (s.kernel.delegate 2, s.kernel.delegations 2))) == some (some 9, [Cap.node 0, Cap.node 2])  --  some (some 9, [Cap.node 0, Cap.node 2])

-- BridgeMint: actor 9 (holds `node 0`) mints +40 into cell 0 — local credit commits, discloses +40:
#guard ((bridgeMintStep ss0 9 0 40).isSome)  --  true
#guard ((bridgeMintStep ss0 9 0 40).map (fun s => recTotal s.kernel)) == some 145  --  some 145 (= 105 + 40)
-- An unauthorized bridge-mint (actor 0) is rejected (the LOCAL gate, independent of foreign finality):
#guard ((bridgeMintStep ss0 0 0 40).isSome) == false  --  false

-- BridgeLock: owner 0 escrows 30 into lock-cell 1 (owns cell 0) — commits, CONSERVES (105 → 105):
#guard ((bridgeLockStep ss0 0 1 30 777).isSome)  --  true
#guard ((bridgeLockStep ss0 0 1 30 777).map (fun s => recTotal s.kernel)) == some 105  --  some 105 (PAIRED Σ=0)
-- ...the value moved owner 0 (100→70) into lock-cell 1 (5→35):
#guard ((bridgeLockStep ss0 0 1 30 777).map (fun s => balOf (s.kernel.cell 0))) == some 70  --  some 70
#guard ((bridgeLockStep ss0 0 1 30 777).map (fun s => balOf (s.kernel.cell 1))) == some 35  --  some 35
-- ...and lock-cell 1's `bridge_lock` nullifier-nonce is set to 777:
#guard ((bridgeLockStep ss0 0 1 30 777).map (fun s => lockOf (s.kernel.cell 1))) == some 777  --  some 777

-- BridgeCancel: owner 0 refunds 30 back from lock-cell 1 — commits, CONSERVES:
#guard ((bridgeCancelStep ss0 0 1 30).isSome) == false  --  false (no value at lock yet)
-- (cancel after a lock: lock then cancel round-trips conservatively — checked via composition below)

-- BridgeFinalize: consume lock-cell 1's nullifier (live) — commits, CONSERVES, retires the lock to 999:
#guard ((bridgeFinalizeStep ss0 9 1 999).isSome)  --  true
#guard ((bridgeFinalizeStep ss0 9 1 999).map (fun s => recTotal s.kernel)) == some 105  --  some 105 (balance FRAMED)
#guard ((bridgeFinalizeStep ss0 9 1 999).map (fun s => lockOf (s.kernel.cell 1))) == some 999  --  some 999 (spent)
-- A finalize on a dead lock-cell is rejected:
#guard ((bridgeFinalizeStep ss0 9 7 999).isSome) == false  --  false
