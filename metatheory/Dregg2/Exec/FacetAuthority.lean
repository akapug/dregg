# Dregg2.Exec.FacetAuthority — the FAITHFUL deployed authority model (`AuthRequired` tier × `EffectMask` facet).

## Why this module exists (the kernel-fidelity correction, decision #2(A))

The kernel's `Dregg2.Exec.authorizedB` (`Kernel.lean`) authorizes a turn over `src` by a TOY
test: the actor owns `src`, OR holds a `Cap.node src`, OR an `endpoint src` cap whose abstract
`List Auth` rights `contains Auth.write`. The DEPLOYED system the kernel is supposed to refine
authorizes by TWO axes, BOTH committed in the 7-field cap leaf (`circuit/src/cap_root.rs`,
`DeployedCapTree.CapLeaf`):

  * an **`AuthRequired` tier** — `auth_tag` (`cell/src/permissions.rs::AuthRequired`:
    `None`/`Signature`/`Proof`/`Either`/`Impossible`/`Custom{vk_hash}`) — the auth METHOD a
    holder must satisfy to exercise the cap (a signature, a proof, either, never, or a
    custom-verifier witness);
  * an **`EffectMask` facet** — `mask_lo`/`mask_hi` (`cell/src/facet.rs`: a `u32` bitmask, one
    bit per effect KIND) — which effect kinds the cap permits, checked by
    `is_effect_permitted(mask, EFFECT_<kind>) = EFFECT_<kind> & mask != 0` (with
    `Some(0) = deny-all`, the P2-1 fix), and attenuated bitwise-subset by
    `is_facet_attenuation(parent, child) = child & parent == child` (the E-language non-amp).

This module models that deployed cap FAITHFULLY and defines `authorizedFacetB`: the actor holds
a cap over `turn.src` whose FACET permits the turn's effect-kind AND whose TIER is satisfied by
the authorization the turn provides. It is PURELY ADDITIVE — the toy `authorizedB`/`List Auth`
machinery is untouched (the cutover that retires it is `§10`, run by the main loop).

## What is faithful to what (the field-by-field contract)

  * `AuthTier` ≡ `AuthRequired` (`permissions.rs:5`): the SIX constructors, byte order
    None=0…Custom=5 (`cap_root.rs:46` `auth_tag`). `AuthProvided` ≡ `AuthKind`
    (`permissions.rs:76`). `AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy` ≡ `AuthRequired::is_satisfied_by`
    (`permissions.rs:33`, incl. `Custom`/`Impossible` fail-closed). `AuthTier.narrowerOrEqual`
    ≡ `AuthRequired::is_narrower_or_equal` (`permissions.rs:52`).
  * `EffectMask := Nat` (the deployed `u32`). `EFFECT_<kind>` ≡ `facet.rs:36-77` bit positions.
    `isEffectPermitted` ≡ `is_effect_permitted` (`facet.rs:123`, incl. `some 0 = deny-all`).
    `isFacetAttenuation` ≡ `is_facet_attenuation` (`facet.rs:107`, bitwise subset).
  * `FacetCap` carries `target`, `tier`, `facet` (= the deployed `CapabilityRef`'s
    `{target, permissions, allowed_effects}`, the authority-bearing core), and an `effectKind`
    accessor maps a turn's intent to its `EFFECT_<kind>` bit. `authorizedFacetB` welds to the
    `AuthModes.facetOk` Bool the abstract six-mode dispatcher already reads.

/-! ## §1 — the `AuthRequired` TIER axis (faithful to `cell/src/permissions.rs`).

The auth METHOD a cap holder must satisfy. The deployed `auth_tag` felt is the tier byte
(`None=0…Custom=5`). We keep the six constructors and the two order-theoretic operations the
deployed system uses: `is_satisfied_by` (does a provided `AuthKind` discharge the tier?) and
`is_narrower_or_equal` (the attenuation order on tiers). -/

/-- **`AuthTier`** ≡ `cell/src/permissions.rs::AuthRequired`. The auth method required to exercise
a cap. `custom vkHash` carries the verification-key hash (folded to a felt in `auth_tag`). -/
inductive AuthTier where
  /-- (0) `None` — always allowed, no authorization needed. -/
  | none
  /-- (1) `Signature` — an Ed25519 signature from the cell's key. -/
  | signature
  /-- (2) `Proof` — a ZK proof matching the cell's verification key. -/
  | proof
  /-- (3) `Either` — a signature OR a proof suffices. -/
  | either
  /-- (4) `Impossible` — permanently locked; this action can never be performed. -/
  | impossible
  /-- (5) `Custom vkHash` — app-defined: requires a `Custom` witness whose `vk_hash` matches. -/
  | custom (vkHash : Nat)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The deployed `auth_tag` tier BYTE (`cap_root.rs:46`: `None=0…Custom=5`). The `custom` case
absorbs `vkHash` in the deployed leaf; here the byte is the discriminant `5` (the leaf's
`auth_tag` felt additionally mixes `vkHash`, modelled by `CapLeaf.auth_tag` carrying it). -/
def AuthTier.tierByte : AuthTier → Nat
  | .none       => 0
  | .signature  => 1
  | .proof      => 2
  | .either     => 3
  | .impossible => 4
  | .custom _   => 5

/-- **`AuthProvided`** ≡ `cell/src/permissions.rs::AuthKind` — the auth a turn actually supplies. -/
inductive AuthProvided where
  /-- An Ed25519 signature was provided. -/
  | signature
  /-- A ZK proof was provided. -/
  | proof
  /-- An app-defined `Custom` witness with the named `vk_hash` was provided + verified. -/
  | custom (vkHash : Nat)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **`AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy`** ≡ `AuthRequired::is_satisfied_by` (`permissions.rs:33`), EXTENDED
faithfully to the `Custom` provided witness: `None` is always satisfied; `Signature`/`Proof`
match the provided kind; `Either` accepts a sig OR a proof; `Impossible` is never satisfied; a
`Custom vk` tier is satisfied ONLY by a `Custom vk'` provided witness with `vk = vk'` (the
executor's per-variant `vk_hash` check — the `AuthKind` lattice alone can NOT discharge it, so a
plain `Signature`/`Proof` does not satisfy `Custom`, exactly as the Rust documents). -/
def AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy : AuthTier → AuthProvided → Bool
  | .none,         _              => true
  | .signature,    .signature     => true
  | .signature,    _              => false
  | .proof,        .proof         => true
  | .proof,        _              => false

  | .custom vk,    .custom vk'    => decide (vk = vk')
  | .custom _,     _              => false

/-- **`AuthTier.narrowerOrEqual self other`** ≡ `AuthRequired::is_narrower_or_equal`
(`permissions.rs:52`): `self` is at least as restrictive as `other`. `Impossible` is the bottom
(narrowest); `None` is the top (broadest); `Proof`/`Signature` are narrower than `Either`; two
`Custom`s are comparable only on `vk_hash` equality; `Custom` is incomparable with the IPC
tiers. Faithful to the Rust match arm-for-arm. -/
def AuthTier.narrowerOrEqual : AuthTier → AuthTier → Bool
  | .impossible,  _            => true                 -- Impossible most restrictive
  | _,            .impossible  => false                -- (_, Impossible): only Impossible ≤ Impossible
  | _,            .none        => true                 -- None least restrictive
  | .none,        _            => false                -- None ≤ x only when x = None (handled above)
  | .proof,       .either      => true                 -- Proof narrower than Either
  | .signature,   .either      => true                 -- Signature narrower than Either
  | .custom a,    .custom b     => decide (a = b)       -- equal vk_hash only
  | .custom _,    _            => false                -- Custom vs Sig/Proof/Either: incomparable

  | a,            b            => decide (a = b)        -- same level

/-! ## §2 — the `EffectMask` FACET axis (faithful to `cell/src/facet.rs`).

`EffectMask = u32`, one bit per effect KIND. We model the felt mask as a `Nat` (the deployed
`u32`); the deployed leaf splits it `mask_lo`/`mask_hi`. The two load-bearing operations are
`is_effect_permitted` (does the mask carry this effect's bit?) and `is_facet_attenuation`
(bitwise subset = the non-amp narrowing). -/

/-- The deployed `EffectMask` (`facet.rs:31`, a `u32`); here `Nat` (deployment is `u32`). -/
abbrev EffectMask := Nat

/-- Effect-kind bit positions, EXACTLY `cell/src/facet.rs:36-77` (`EFFECT_<kind> = 1 << n`). -/
def EFFECT_SET_FIELD          : EffectMask := 1 <<< 0
def EFFECT_TRANSFER           : EffectMask := 1 <<< 1
def EFFECT_GRANT_CAPABILITY   : EffectMask := 1 <<< 2
def EFFECT_REVOKE_CAPABILITY  : EffectMask := 1 <<< 3
def EFFECT_EMIT_EVENT         : EffectMask := 1 <<< 4
def EFFECT_INCREMENT_NONCE    : EffectMask := 1 <<< 5
def EFFECT_CREATE_CELL        : EffectMask := 1 <<< 6
def EFFECT_SET_PERMISSIONS    : EffectMask := 1 <<< 7
def EFFECT_SET_VERIFICATION_KEY : EffectMask := 1 <<< 8

/-- `EFFECT_ALL` = `0xFFFF_FFFF` (`facet.rs:80`, all kinds permitted = unrestricted-when-`Some`). -/
def EFFECT_ALL : EffectMask := 0xFFFF_FFFF

/-- **`isEffectPermitted mask effectBit`** ≡ `cell/src/facet.rs:123` `is_effect_permitted`:
`none ⇒ unrestricted` (all permitted); `some 0 ⇒ deny-all` (the P2-1 fix: a zero mask denies,
NOT widens); `some m ⇒ effectBit &&& m ≠ 0`. -/
def isEffectPermitted : Option EffectMask → EffectMask → Bool
  | .none,       _        => true
  | .some 0,     _        => false
  | .some m,     bit      => decide (bit &&& m ≠ 0)

/-- **`isFacetAttenuation parent child`** ≡ `cell/src/facet.rs:107` `is_facet_attenuation`:
`child` is a bitwise SUBSET of `parent` (`child &&& parent = child`) — the E-language
non-amplification: facets only restrict, never widen. -/
def isFacetAttenuation (parent child : EffectMask) : Bool :=
  decide (child &&& parent = child)

/-! ## §3 — `FacetCap`: the deployed cap's authority-bearing core (faithful to `CapabilityRef`).

`cell/src/capability.rs::CapabilityRef` carries `{target, slot, permissions: AuthRequired,
allowed_effects: Option<EffectMask>, breadstuff, expires_at, stored_epoch}`. The AUTHORITY core
— what gates exercise — is `(target, permissions, allowed_effects)`. `FacetCap` models exactly
that triple. (`slot`/`breadstuff`/`expires_at`/`stored_epoch` are c-list / freshness metadata,
orthogonal to the tier×facet authority decision modelled here; freshness is the
`AuthContext.freshOk` bit in `AuthModes`.) -/

/-- **`FacetCap`** — the deployed cap's authority core (`capability.rs::CapabilityRef`):
the connectivity `target`, the `AuthRequired` `tier`, and the `Option EffectMask` `facet`
(`allowed_effects` — `none` = unrestricted). -/
structure FacetCap where
  /-- The capability's target cell (`CapabilityRef::target`). -/
  target : Label
  /-- The required-auth tier (`CapabilityRef::permissions : AuthRequired`). -/
  tier   : AuthTier
  /-- The facet mask (`CapabilityRef::allowed_effects : Option EffectMask`; `none` = all). -/
  facet  : Option EffectMask
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The c-list face: a cell's held `FacetCap`s, keyed by holder label (the deployed
`CapabilitySet` per cell). -/
abbrev FacetCaps := Label → List FacetCap

/-! ## §4 — the EFFECT KIND of a turn (which `EFFECT_<bit>` it requires).

A `Kernel.Turn` is a value MOVEMENT `src ⇒ dst` — the deployed `Effect::Transfer`, so it
requires the `EFFECT_TRANSFER` bit. We expose the mapping as a function so the cutover and other
effect families (set-field, grant, …) extend it; the transfer turn pins `EFFECT_TRANSFER`. -/

/-- The effect-kind bit a balance-movement `Turn` requires: `EFFECT_TRANSFER` (`facet.rs:37`).
A transfer's facet gate is `isEffectPermitted cap.facet (turnEffectBit _) = EFFECT_TRANSFER`. -/
def turnEffectBit (_ : Turn) : EffectMask := EFFECT_TRANSFER

/-! ## §5 — `authorizedFacetB`: the FAITHFUL two-axis authority gate.

The deployed authority decision over a turn: the actor holds a `FacetCap` over `turn.src` whose
FACET permits the turn's effect-kind (`isEffectPermitted`) AND whose TIER is satisfied by the
authorization the turn provides (`isSatisfiedBy`). Owning `src` (`actor = src`) is the intra-vat
l4v `troa_lrefl` short-circuit (own-it ⇒ arbitrary change), exactly as the toy `authorizedB`. -/

/-- A held `FacetCap` AUTHORIZES the turn iff it targets `src`, its facet permits the turn's
effect bit, and its tier is satisfied by `provided`. The per-cap leg of the two-axis gate. -/
def capAuthorizesFacet (provided : AuthProvided) (turn : Turn) (c : FacetCap) : Bool :=
  decide (c.target = turn.src)
    && isEffectPermitted c.facet (turnEffectBit turn)
    && c.tier.isSatisfiedBy provided

/-- **`authorizedFacetB caps provided turn`** — THE faithful deployed authority gate. The actor
owns `src` (intra-vat), OR holds some `FacetCap` over `src` that authorizes the turn on BOTH
axes (facet permits the effect-kind AND the tier is satisfied by `provided`). This is the
tier×facet replacement for the kernel's toy `authorizedB`. -/
def authorizedFacetB (caps : FacetCaps) (provided : AuthProvided) (turn : Turn) : Bool :=
  decide (turn.actor = turn.src)
    || (caps turn.actor).any (capAuthorizesFacet provided turn)

/-! ## §6 — the FAITHFUL teeth (both polarities, non-vacuous).

(1) NON-AMP = the facet bitwise-narrowing is a real subset gate;
(2) a wrong-facet, unauthorized, or wrong-tier action is REJECTED. -/

/-! ### §6.1 — non-amplification: `isFacetAttenuation` is the bitwise-subset non-amp. -/

  simp [Nat.and_self]

/-- **`facet_attenuation_subset_admitted`** — narrowing `{TRANSFER, SET_FIELD}` to `{TRANSFER}`

/-- **`facet_attenuation_amplify_rejected` — the NON-AMP tooth (witness FALSE).** Widening
`{SET_FIELD}` to `{SET_FIELD, TRANSFER}` is NOT an attenuation: TRANSFER is not in the parent,
so the bitwise-subset gate REJECTS it. A facet can only narrow, never amplify. -/

  unfold isEffectPermitted EFFECT_SET_FIELD EFFECT_TRANSFER

theorem signatureTier_satisfied_by_signature :

/-- **The IMPOSSIBLE tooth (witness FALSE).** An `Impossible` tier is satisfied by NOTHING —
a permanently-locked action never authorizes, no matter what auth is provided. -/
theorem impossibleTier_never_satisfied (p : AuthProvided) :
    AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy .impossible p = false := by cases p <;> rfl

/-- **The CUSTOM tooth.** A `Custom vk` tier is satisfied ONLY by a `Custom vk'` witness with
matching `vk_hash` — a plain signature/proof does NOT discharge it, and a mismatched vk fails. -/
theorem customTier_matches_vk_only :

    ∧ AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy (.custom 7) .signature = false := by
  refine ⟨?_, ?_, rfl⟩ <;> decide

/-! ### §6.4 — tier-narrowing non-amp (the attenuation order on the auth method). -/

/-- `Signature`/`Proof` are narrower than `Either`; `Impossible` is narrowest; `None` is broadest
— the honest tier attenuations are admitted. -/

/-- **The TIER-AMPLIFY tooth (witness FALSE).** `Either` is NOT narrower-or-equal to `Signature`

Concrete edge: actor 5 holds a TRANSFER-facet, `Signature`-tier cap over src 9; a transfer turn

/-! ## §8 — the bridge to `Kernel.authorizedB` (the cutover's refinement target).

The faithful gate REFINES the toy gate on the shape they share: a cap conferring write over `src`
under a satisfied tier and a transfer-permitting facet. The cutover (§10) swaps the kernel's
authority guard to `authorizedFacetB`; this lemma is the refinement direction the cutover

/-! ## §10.5 — THE FAITHFUL KERNEL GATE (§10(A) landed additively, here below `Kernel`).

`Kernel.lean` cannot reference `authorizedFacetB` (it is imported BY this module — a cycle), so the
additive faithful kernel state + executor live here. `FacetKernelState` carries the deployed FACET
caps (`fcaps : FacetCaps`) alongside the same finite ledger; `execFaithful` is `Kernel.exec` with the
authority conjunct repointed from the toy `authorizedB` onto the faithful two-axis `authorizedFacetB`,
reading the auth the turn `provided`. The conservation/availability/distinctness/liveness legs are
UNCHANGED (orthogonal to authority) — only the authority gate is faithful. The re-stated teeth
(`execFaithful_authorized`/`execFaithful_unauthorized_fails`) are the §10(A) `exec_authorized`/
`exec_unauthorized_fails` over the faithful gate. -/

/-! ## §10 — THE CUTOVER PLAN (file-by-file swaps; what `List Auth` retires).

This module is ADDITIVE. The kernel still authorizes by the toy `authorizedB`. The cutover
(run by the main loop, NOT here) swaps the authority decision to `authorizedFacetB` reading the
cap leaf's COMMITTED `auth_tag` (tier) + `mask_lo`/`mask_hi` (facet). Precisely:

### (A) The kernel gate — `Dregg2/Exec/Kernel.lean`
  * `KernelState.caps : Caps` (= `Label → List Cap`) becomes `FacetCaps` (= `Label → List
    FacetCap`), OR the kernel grows a parallel `fcaps : FacetCaps` field (additive-then-cutover,
    to keep `exec_conserves` untouched while the authority leg migrates).
  * `Turn` grows a `provided : AuthProvided` field (the auth the turn supplies — the deployed
    `Authorization` the executor verified). Default-construct it `.signature` at the legacy
    call sites until they thread the real provided kind.
  * `def authorizedB (caps) (turn) := …` is REPLACED at its single call site (the `exec` `if`,
    `Kernel.lean:70`) by `authorizedFacetB k.fcaps turn.provided turn`. The OLD `authorizedB`
    and its `Cap.node`/`Cap.endpoint`/`Auth.write`/`List Auth` machinery STAY (other modules
    still reference them) but become DEAD for the kernel gate — retire them in a later sweep
    once no `import` reads them (grep: `authorizedB`, `Auth.write`, `rights.contains`).
  * `exec_authorized`/`exec_unauthorized_fails` re-state over `authorizedFacetB` (the proofs are
    structurally identical: read the guard conjunct off the `if`).

### (B) The full-state spec guard — `Dregg2/Circuit/Spec/balancemovement.lean`
  * `admitGuardA` conjunct (1) `authorizedB k.caps t = true` becomes
    `authorizedFacetB k.fcaps t.provided t = true`. Every downstream theorem
    (`recCexecAsset_iff_spec`, `execFullA_balanceA_iff_spec`, the `…_rejects_*` non-vacuity
    teeth) re-derives unchanged in shape — `balanceMovement_rejects_unauthorized`'s hypothesis
    becomes `authorizedFacetB … = false`. The executor `recKExecAsset`/`recCexecAsset`
    (`RecordKernel.lean:719`) must read the new guard at its `if`; the spec follows.

### (C) The cap-leaf bridge — `Dregg2/Circuit/DeployedCapTree.lean`
  * `confersWriteLeaf l := l.mask_lo = rightsMaskOf (endpoint 0 [read, write])` becomes the
    TWO-AXIS predicate `confersTransferLeaf l := isEffectPermitted (some (maskOfLimbs l.mask_lo
    l.mask_hi)) EFFECT_TRANSFER ∧ tierSatisfied (tierOfTag l.auth_tag) provided` — i.e. the leaf
    confers authority iff its FACET (decoded from `mask_lo`/`mask_hi` per `cap_root.rs::
    split_effect_mask`) permits the turn's effect AND its TIER (decoded from `auth_tag`,
    None=0…Custom=5) is satisfied. The current `mask_lo == write-mask` check is the abstract
    `Auth` rights shadow (the NAMED HORIZONLOG fork the cap-open emit already flagged); the
    cutover REPLACES it with the genuine `EffectMask` facet bit + the `auth_tag` tier.
  * `DeployedFaithful.backed` rewrites: a member opening whose facet permits the effect AND whose
    tier is satisfied is backed by a `FacetCap` over `src` admitting the turn — and
    `deployedCapOpen_implies_authorizedB` concludes `authorizedFacetB`, NOT the toy
    `authorizedB`. The body REUSES `authorizedFacetB_holds_transfer_cap` (this module) verbatim:
    exhibit the held `FacetCap`, discharge the two legs.
  * `Dregg2/Circuit/DeployedCapOpen.lean::capOpen_authorizes` and
    `Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/CapOpenEmit.lean::capOpenAttenuateV3_authorizes` then conclude
    `authorizedFacetB` through the rewritten bridge — the `writeMaskGate` becomes a
    `transferFacetGate` (decode `mask_lo`/`mask_hi`, check `EFFECT_TRANSFER` bit) PLUS an
    `authTagGate` (decode `auth_tag`, check the tier), both already-faithful-to-`facet.rs`
    column gates.

### (D) What `List Auth` machinery RETIRES (the toy model deletion)
  * `Kernel.authorizedB`'s `Cap.node`/`Cap.endpoint t rights`/`rights.contains Auth.write` test
    (the toy authority) — once (A) lands and no kernel gate reads it.
  * The `confersWriteLeaf` write-mask shadow in `DeployedCapTree` — replaced by the two-axis
    facet+tier leaf predicate in (C).
  * The `Auth.write`-bit `rightsMaskOf` write encoding (`EffectVmEmitCapReshape.rightsMaskOf`
    over `Auth`) STAYS for the cap-RESHAPE non-amp lattice (that is the genuine `Finset Auth`
    delegation order, orthogonal to the per-effect facet); only the kernel-GATE's use of the
    `Auth.write` shadow retires.

### Residuals (genuine, NAMED — not deferred silently)
  * **The `auth_tag` ↔ tier-byte encoding.** The deployed `auth_tag` is the tier byte
    (None=0…Custom=5) with the 8 `vk_hash` limbs absorbed for `Custom` (`cap_root.rs:46`). The
    cutover's `tierOfTag : ℤ → AuthTier` decode must reproduce that absorb for `Custom` (two
    distinct `vk_hash`es ⇒ distinct `auth_tag` felts). For the IPC tiers (None…Impossible) the
    byte is the discriminant; `AuthTier.tierByte` (§1) already pins it. The `Custom` felt-decode
    is the one genuinely-crypto residual (a Poseidon2 absorb, named — not a gap).
  * **A plain transfer's required tier.** Open question the cutover must settle:
    `cell/src/permissions.rs::default_user()` sets `send: Signature` — so a plain
    holder-initiated transfer's tier is `Signature` (a sig discharges it), NOT `None`. But the
    deployed `Effect::Transfer` is exercised via a CAP whose `permissions` field is the tier the
    GRANTOR set on the cap (could be `None` for an open-bearer transfer cap, `Signature` for a
    sig-gated one, `Proof` for a zkApp). So the tier is NOT fixed per-effect; it is the
    `auth_tag` the cap leaf commits. The cutover reads it off the leaf (no per-effect default);
    `turnEffectBit` fixes only the FACET bit, the tier comes from the cap. (For the OWNER
    short-circuit there is no tier — owning `src` is intra-vat, l4v `troa_lrefl`, gated by
    neither axis, as both gates agree per `facet_refines_owner`.)
