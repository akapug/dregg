# Dregg2.Exec.GatedForestCfg — first-class gated-forest carrier bundle.

Packages the `execFullForestG` carrier parameters as a `GatedForestCarriers` record, with
`starbridgeCarriers` the canonical production instance. Downstream modules `open StarbridgeGated`
instead of a pinned `Demo`/`Production` namespace.

**Production routing for `.coordinated` caveats:** intra-cell `execFullForestG` fail-closes
(see `FullForestAuth.GatedCaveat.holds`); the positive bilateral path is
`CoordinatedForestGLift.execCoordinatedForestG` over a `BilateralForestPairG` of two
`RecChainedState` snapshots (honest — no cross-cell reads on one cell).

/-! ### A1 — the REAL-RIGHTS cap-authority leg (the WHAT, now load-bearing).

`mkAuth` pins `capMode := .unchecked (Guard.all [])`, which `authModeAdmits` admits for ALL inputs —
so the proved `granted ≤ held` attenuation theory was proved-but-never-exercised over the wire. Here
we route the delegation edge's `keep`/`parentCap` into a `.capTpDelivered` cap mode whose
`granted := keep.toFinset` and `held := confRights parentCap` over the REAL `ExecAuth = Finset Auth`
lattice. `authModeAdmits (.capTpDelivered ⟨_,_,held,granted⟩ _) = decide (granted.rights ≤ held.rights)
&& facetOk && freshOk`, so a delegation edge that AMPLIFIES (`keep ⊄ parentCap.rights`) makes the WHAT
leg FALSE ⇒ the gate fail-closes ⇒ whole-turn rollback. This makes the attenuation theory load-bearing
at the wire. -/

The two forests below share EVERYTHING — the same genuine credential, the same caveat, the same
`emitEvent` action — differing ONLY in the delegated edge's `keep`/`parentCap`. The non-amplifying
one (`keep = [read]` against a parent cap `.endpoint 0 [read,write]`) COMMITS; the amplifying one
(`keep = [read,write]` against a parent cap `.endpoint 0 [read]`) is REJECTED by `capAuthorityG`
(`granted ⊄ held` over `ExecAuth`) ⇒ the whole forest rolls back. The previous `.unchecked` cap mode
admitted BOTH. This is the same-wire contrast proving the proved `granted ≤ held` attenuation is now
load-bearing — not admit-by-construction. -/

/-! ### A2 — the AGENT-FACING `Authorization::Token` path (the biscuit credential the Rust
SubAgent / node-MCP surface constructs), now gating the EXECUTOR on the SAME live `execFullForestG`
path — both the WHO (biscuit signature) and the WHAT (the token's attenuation caveats) leg.

The Rust `sdk::SubAgent::execute` / `node::mcp::dispatch_tool` surfaces mint a public-key biscuit
and present it as `Authorization::Token`; the EXECUTOR (`verify_token_for_scope` /
`verify_token_authorization`), not an out-of-band `cap.verify()`, admits or rejects the turn. This
section is the Lean mirror: the gated forest's ROOT credential is the `Authorization.token` arm AND
its cap-authority leg is the REAL `AuthMode.token` (the windowed biscuit's attenuation caveats), NOT
the `.unchecked` admit-by-construction `mkAuth` pins. So the token gates the executor admission on
BOTH legs, witnessed non-vacuously each direction:

  * a VALID, in-scope token (genuine biscuit signature ∧ caveat context inside the granted window)
    is ADMITTED → the forest COMMITS;
  * a FORGED-signature token (the biscuit signature does not verify) is REJECTED by the WHO leg
    (`credentialValidG = false`) → `none`, whole-forest rollback;
  * an OVER-ATTENUATED token (the credential is presented in a context OUTSIDE its granted window —
    the biscuit's own attenuation caveats narrow it out) is REJECTED by the WHAT leg
    (`capAuthorityG = false`) → `none`, whole-forest rollback.

The two negatives are ORTHOGONAL (different gate legs), so neither is laundered by the other. This is
the executable face of "the token gates the executor, not the narration." -/

/-! ### A3 — the TIER-3 COORDINATED caveat, WELDED into the production gate (executed end-to-end).

`GatedCaveat.holds` on `.coordinated` was a dead fail-closed branch (`FullForestAuth.lean`): a
cross-cell read could never discharge on a single-cell node, so a tier-3 caveat HARD-REJECTED on the
production `caveatsDischarged`/`gateOK`/`execFullForestG` path — the positive coordinated discharge
lived only in the parallel `execCoordinatedForestG` executor. The `cross` field welds the proved
atomic-snapshot equalizer (`CoordinatedCaveat.dischargeCoordinated` / `CrossCaveat.jointApplyCaveated`)
INLINE: on a single machine the companion cell lives in the SAME `RecChainedState`, so the cross-cell
condition is read on the SAME snapshot `s` the node commits against (`gateOK na s` reads exactly the
`s` `execFullA` runs on — `gatedNode_check_eq_use` — so time-of-check = time-of-use, no TOCTOU). The
two forests below share EVERYTHING (same genuine credential, same balance-neutral `emitEvent`, same
companion cell `1`) and differ ONLY in the cross-cell THRESHOLD:

  * the SATISFIED covenant (companion cell `1` holds ≥ `5` of asset `0`, and at `fma0` it holds
    exactly `5`) ⇒ the coordinated caveat DISCHARGES ⇒ `caveatsDischarged = true` ⇒ the gate ADMITS ⇒
    the forest COMMITS;
  * the VIOLATED covenant (companion cell `1` would need ≥ `10`, but holds only `5`) ⇒ the coordinated
    caveat FAILS ⇒ `caveatsDischarged = false` ⇒ the gate REJECTS ⇒ `execFullForestG = none`, rollback.

So the tier-3 cross-cell caveat is EXECUTED end-to-end on the SAME live entry as tier-1/tier-2.
Non-vacuous each direction (witnessed true AND false). -/

/-! ### A4 — the MACAROON CAVEAT-CHAIN operator, EXECUTED on the live gate (HMAC tail-binding teeth).

Tiers 1-3 (within-cell / cap-authority / coordinated) are witnessed above; the FOURTH authority
operator — the macaroon HMAC caveat-CHAIN (`NodeAuth.chain`) — was, until here, only ever pinned
`chain := none` on the live `execFullForestG` path, so its `chainGateG` leg ran only in its no-op
ABSENT arm. The chain LAWS are proved in `Authority/CaveatChain.lean` (`removal_breaks_tail` /
`chain_unforgeable` consuming `MacKernel.unforgeable`), but a guarantee that never fires on the live
gate is narrated, not executed. This section welds a REAL macaroon chain onto a live gated forest's
root `NodeAuth.chain` and witnesses it BOTH ways on the SAME `execFullForestG` entry:

  * a GENUINE, in-window chain (`CaveatChain.Demo.windowed` — a `seed` then two honest `append`s,
    verifying by `honest_chain_verifies`, admitting at height `150 ∈ [100,200]`) ⇒ `chainGateG = true`
    ⇒ `caveatsDischarged = true` ⇒ the gate ADMITS ⇒ the forest COMMITS;
  * a FORGED chain (`CaveatChain.Demo.forgedDropped` — `windowed`'s tail kept but the last caveat
    DROPPED without re-signing, the `test_removed_caveat_fails` attack) ⇒ `Chain.verify = false`
    (`removal_breaks_tail` is why: the dropped HMAC step is no no-op under a sound `mac`) ⇒
    `chainGateG = false` ⇒ `caveatsDischarged = false` ⇒ the gate REJECTS ⇒ `execFullForestG = none`,
    rollback.

So the HMAC tail-binding is EXECUTED end-to-end on the live gate — caveat-removal is caught at the
executor admission, not in a side theorem. Non-vacuous each direction (verify-true admits AND
verify-false rejects), on the same production entry as tiers 1-3. The macaroon `MacKernel` here is the
honest reference kernel (`CaveatChain.honestMacKernel`), whose `unforgeable` carrier is PROVED
(`honest_unforgeable`) and is provably FALSE for the collapsing kernel (`collapse_not_unforgeable`) —
so the integrity is load-bearing, not a `True` no-op. -/
