# Dregg2.Exec.AuthTurn — the authority-mutating executable kernel transition.

`recKExec` is a balance turn: it rewrites `balance` and preserves `caps`, holding the authority
graph fixed. This module builds the dual — an authority-mutating kernel that edits `caps` (a
Granovetter delegate or a revoke) rather than the balance field — and proves:
  * the dual frame: `recTotal` is unchanged by an authority turn (conservation-trivial);
  * the graph-change equalities: the cap-edit IS `Spec.addEdge`/`removeEdge` on `execGraph`,
    making the cap-edit's abstract image a `Spec.AuthStep`.

Why `execGraph` matches: rights are abstracted to `ExecRights = Unit` (connectivity skeleton), so a
`Spec.Cap Label ExecRights` is determined by its target (`c = ⟨t, ()⟩ ↔ c.target = t`). Hence
granting any held concrete cap that confers an edge to `t` IS `addEdge … ⟨t,()⟩`, and revoking all
`t`-conferring caps IS `removeEdge … ⟨t,()⟩` — i.e. `Spec.Introduce.result` / `Spec.Revoke.result`
verbatim, without upgrading concrete endpoint rights into control.

Reuses `Exec/Caps.lean`, `Spec.Authority`, and `Spec.ExecRefinement.execGraph`.

/-- Does `cap` confer a connectivity edge to target `t`? A `node t` cap, or an `endpoint t`-
carrying-`write` cap. This is exactly `execGraph`'s `.any` body — the per-cap test the reconstructed
graph reads. -/

  (cap == Cap.node t) ||
  (match cap with
   | .endpoint t' rights => (t' == t) && rights.contains Auth.write
   | _ => false)

/-- `execGraph` unfolded through `confersEdgeTo`: the Spec edge `h ⟶ c` is present iff some cap in
`h`'s slot `confersEdgeTo c.target`. A bridge for graph-change proofs. -/
theorem execGraph_eq_any (caps : Caps) (h : Label) (c : Spec.Cap Label ExecRights) :
    execGraph caps h c = ((caps h).any (fun cap => confersEdgeTo c.target cap) = true) := rfl

/-! ### §1.AUTH-CONNECTS — the GENUINE refinement onto the independent `authConnects` spec.

`execGraph` is DEF-EQ to the executor's `.any confersEdgeTo` lookup gate (`execGraph_eq_any := rfl`),
so a guarantee leg that reads `execGraph caps h c` as a CONNECTIVITY claim attests it tautologically.
`Spec.authConnects` (`ExecRefinement.lean`) is the SEVERED reference — a `Prop`-level existential over
list membership, NOT defeq to the boolean gate. Here we PROVE the executor's concrete c-list lookup
IMPLEMENTS that abstract connectivity (`capLookup_refines_authConnects`), via the per-cap bridge
`confersEdgeTo_iff_authConnectsCap` and `List.any_eq_true` — a REAL proof, not `rfl`. A wrong
cap-lookup (one that connects where no cap confers the edge) would NOT refine — `_separates`. -/

/-- **`confersEdgeTo_iff_authConnectsCap`** — the per-cap bridge: the executable boolean gate
`confersEdgeTo t cap = true` IFF the abstract `Prop` atom `authConnectsCap t cap` (the SAME two
branches — a `node t` cap, or an `endpoint t` cap carrying `write` — boolean vs propositional). This
is what makes the refinement a real proof: the `Bool`-fold and the `∃ … ∧ …` `Prop` agree only after
this case analysis on `cap`, never by `rfl`. -/

/-- **`capLookup_refines_authConnects` — THE GENUINE REFINEMENT.** The executor's concrete c-list
authority lookup `(caps h).any (fun cap => confersEdgeTo c.target cap) = true` IMPLEMENTS the abstract
connectivity relation `authConnects caps h c`. Proved by `List.any_eq_true` (the boolean fold names a
WITNESS member) composed with the per-cap bridge `confersEdgeTo_iff_authConnectsCap` — reasoning about
`confersEdgeTo`/`caps`, NOT `rfl`. A lookup that wrongly reported connectivity for a slot holding no
`c.target`-conferring cap would FAIL to produce the existential witness (`_separates`). -/

/-- **`authConnects_refines_capLookup`** — the converse: `authConnects` IMPLIES the executor's
boolean lookup. Needed to feed an abstract `authConnects` hypothesis back into a `recKDelegate`-style
commit (whose gate is the boolean `.any`). The two are propositionally EQUIVALENT but not defeq, so
this is also a real proof. -/

spec) are PROPOSITIONALLY equivalent (so retargeting a leg from `execGraph caps h c` onto
`authConnects caps h c` loses NO content) — yet NOT definitionally equal (the linter's defeq check
separates them). The bridge the inheritor retargets ride. -/

(used at the cross-cell bilateral grounding). -/

/-- **`capLookup_refines_authConnects_separates` — THE MUTATION-SEPARATION WITNESS.** A cap-table
where the holder's slot is EMPTY: the executor's lookup correctly reports `false` (no connectivity),
and `authConnects` correctly REFUTES the edge. The pairing demonstrates the refinement has teeth: a
mutated lookup that WRONGLY returned `true` here (connecting an empty slot) would assert
`authConnects`, which is FALSE — the implication would be violated. So `capLookup_refines_authConnects`
genuinely constrains the lookup, it is not vacuously true. -/

/-! ## §2 — `ExecRights = Unit`: a Spec cap is determined by its target.

The graph carrier abstracts rights to `Unit`, so `⟨t, ()⟩` is the unique Spec cap to `t`, making
`c = ⟨t,()⟩ ↔ c.target = t` and collapsing the cap-edit's effect to a single `addEdge`/`removeEdge`
on the Spec edge `⟨t,()⟩`. -/

/-! ## §3 — `recKDelegate` — the executable Granovetter delegation.

Edits `caps` and leaves the `cell`/balance state untouched. Fail-closed: gates on the delegator
already holding connectivity to `t` — "only connectivity begets connectivity" (the Granovetter
`Introduce` premise). On commit it copies the concrete held cap that witnesses the premise, rather
than manufacturing a fresh `node t` control cap. -/

/-- The introducer's held cap conferring an edge to `t` (executable `lookup_by_target`): the first
cap in `h`'s slot that `confersEdgeTo t`, or `Cap.null` if none. -/
def heldCapTo (caps : Caps) (h t : Label) : Cap :=
  ((caps h).find? (fun cap => confersEdgeTo t cap)).getD Cap.null

/-- The executable authority turn: `delegator` copies to `recipient` the concrete cap it already
holds that confers an edge to `t`. Commits only when the delegator already holds such a cap
(Granovetter connectivity premise); on commit rewrites only `caps`, leaving every balance intact.
This preserves the abstract `addEdge` behavior while avoiding rights amplification. -/

/-! ### §3.RIGHTS — The attenuating delegation (the genuine `is_attenuation` mirror).

`recKDelegate` copies the witness cap unchanged. `recKDelegateAtten` is the explicitly attenuating
variant: locate the held cap, attenuate to `keep`, and grant the attenuated cap. The granted cap's
conferred rights are `⊆` the held cap's (`attenuate_confRights_le`) — the genuine `granted.rights ≤
held.rights` over `ExecAuth`, not a `()≤()` collapse. -/

/-- The rights-carrying Granovetter delegation (faithful `apply_introduce`): on commit, grant
`recipient` the delegator's held cap to `t` attenuated to `keep`. The granted cap carries real
rights `⊆` the held cap's (`attenuate_confRights_le`). Fail-closed: no held cap to `t` ⇒ none. -/

    Option RecordKernelState :=
  if (k.caps delegator).any (fun cap => confersEdgeTo t cap) = true then
    some { k with caps := grant k.caps recipient (attenuate keep (heldCapTo k.caps delegator t)) }
  else
    none

/-- The executable revocation authority turn: `holder` drops every cap conferring an edge to `t`,
removing the `execGraph` edge to `t` (matching abstract `removeEdge`). Always commits; rewrites
only `caps`, leaving balances intact. -/
def recKRevokeTarget (k : RecordKernelState) (holder t : Label) : RecordKernelState :=
  { k with caps := fun l => if l = holder then (k.caps l).filter (fun cap => ¬ confersEdgeTo t cap)
                            else k.caps l }

/-! ## §4 — The dual frame lemma: an authority turn preserves `recTotal`.

Where a balance turn holds `caps` fixed, an authority turn holds `recTotal` fixed — proved by the
cap-edit touching only `caps` (so `cell`, hence `balOf`, hence `recTotal`, is unchanged). -/

/-! ### §3.EPOCH — the delegation-revocation EPOCH semantics (the faithful `apply_revoke_delegation`).

`recKRevokeTarget` is the SHARED cap-edge `removeEdge` that ALL THREE revocation arms perform
(`revoke` / `dropRefA` / `revokeDelegationA`). But dregg1's `apply_revoke_delegation`
(`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:3044-3082`) does MORE than the bare edge removal — and CRUCIALLY, the
plain `revoke` (`apply_revoke_capability`, `apply.rs:673`) and `dropRef` (`apply_drop_ref`,
`apply.rs:4056`) do NOT. So the epoch semantics live in a DEDICATED step composed ONLY onto the
delegation arm — modelling the bump inside the shared `recKRevokeTarget` would be UNFAITHFUL to
`revoke`/`dropRef` (the "wrong-cell pale ghost" the audit warns against).

dregg1's `apply_revoke_delegation(action_target = PARENT, child)` does, beyond the edge removal:
  * (2) `parent.state.bump_delegation_epoch()` (`apply.rs:3069`) — bumps the PARENT cell's
    `delegation_epoch` by `+1` (folded into the canonical state commitment, `commitment.rs:263`);
  * (3) `child.delegation = None` (`apply.rs:3080`) — clears the CHILD cell's `DelegatedRef` snapshot.

In the Lean `revokeDelegationA holder t` arm, `holder` is the PARENT (the cap-edge holder that drops
the child's edge, `TurnExecutorFull.lean:5419`) and `t` is the CHILD. So the faithful map is:
bump `delegationEpoch holder` (the parent), clear `delegations t` and its stamp `delegationEpochAt t`
(the child's snapshot). -/

/-- **`recKRevokeDelegationEpoch k parent child`** — the delegation-revocation EXTRAS dregg1's
`apply_revoke_delegation` performs beyond the shared cap-edge removal: bump the PARENT's
`delegationEpoch` (+1, `apply.rs:3069`) and CLEAR the CHILD's snapshot `delegations` + its epoch stamp
`delegationEpochAt` (`apply.rs:3080`). Edits ONLY the three epoch/snapshot registries — balance-NEUTRAL
(`recTotal`/`accounts`/`cell`/`caps` untouched). NOT applied by `revoke`/`dropRef` (those carry no epoch
semantics in dregg1). -/
def recKRevokeDelegationEpoch (k : RecordKernelState) (parent child : Label) : RecordKernelState :=
  { k with
    delegationEpoch   := fun c => if c = parent then k.delegationEpoch c + 1 else k.delegationEpoch c
    delegations       := fun c => if c = child then [] else k.delegations c
    delegationEpochAt := fun c => if c = child then 0 else k.delegationEpochAt c }

/-- **`recKRevokeDelegationFull k parent child`** — the FAITHFUL full kernel step for dregg1's
`apply_revoke_delegation`: the shared cap-edge `removeEdge` (`recKRevokeTarget`, leg (1)) COMPOSED with
the epoch bump + child-snapshot clear (`recKRevokeDelegationEpoch`, legs (2)+(3)). This is the kernel
step that models ALL THREE things `apply_revoke_delegation` does. The cap-edge holder `parent` is the
revoking parent; `child` is the revoked child. -/
def recKRevokeDelegationFull (k : RecordKernelState) (parent child : Label) : RecordKernelState :=
  recKRevokeDelegationEpoch (recKRevokeTarget k parent child) parent child

/-- **`delegationStale k child`** — the FRESHNESS check a light client runs (dregg1's acceptor-side
epoch test, `delegation.rs:53`/`apply.rs`): the child's delegation snapshot is STALE iff its recorded
stamp `delegationEpochAt child` is STRICTLY BELOW the child's parent's CURRENT `delegationEpoch`. A
parent revoke bumps the parent's epoch, so every outstanding child snapshot stamped under the old epoch
falls behind ⇒ STALE ⇒ a revoked delegation cannot be replayed. A child with no parent is never stale. -/
def delegationStale (k : RecordKernelState) (child : Label) : Bool :=
  match k.delegate child with
  | some parent => decide (k.delegationEpochAt child < k.delegationEpoch parent)
  | none        => false

/-- **`recKRevokeDelegationFull_frame` — the full delegation-revoke is balance-NEUTRAL.** Like
the bare `recKRevokeTarget`, the faithful full step (cap-edge removal + epoch bump + snapshot clear)
edits only `caps`/`delegationEpoch`/`delegations`/`delegationEpochAt` — so `recTotal`, `accounts`, and
`cell` are untouched. Revocation moves no value, even with the epoch semantics modelled. -/
theorem recKRevokeDelegationFull_frame (k : RecordKernelState) (parent child : Label) :
    recTotal (recKRevokeDelegationFull k parent child) = recTotal k ∧
      (recKRevokeDelegationFull k parent child).accounts = k.accounts ∧

  -- `recKRevokeDelegationEpoch` edits only the epoch/snapshot registries; `recKRevokeTarget` only `caps`.

/-- **`recKRevokeDelegationFull_caps` — the full step's cap-edge IS the shared `removeEdge`.**
The faithful step's `caps` post-state equals the bare `recKRevokeTarget`'s — the epoch/snapshot legs
touch no `caps`. So the cap-graph soundness (`recKRevokeTarget_execGraph`, the connector `unify_revoke`)
carries verbatim onto the full step. -/

parent's pre-epoch was at least the child's stamp (the snapshot was fresh before), then the child's
snapshot is now STALE: its stamp (reset to `0` ≤, and strictly below the bumped `parent` epoch). A light
client checking `delegationStale` would now REJECT the revoked delegation — it cannot be replayed. This
