# Dregg2.Exec.Program — the RecordProgram as the coalgebra structure-map (over records).

`RecordProgram` is the coalgebra structure-map — the `AdmissibleTurn ⇒ Cell` arrow.
Faithfully transcribed from dregg1's ~21-variant `StateConstraint` catalog
(`cell/src/program.rs`), but **name-keyed** over the Preserves `Value`/`Schema` of
`Exec/Value.lean`, not bit-positioned over 8 fixed slots.

`RecordProgram.admits` is the admissibility filter: the *domain* of the structure-map. It is
decidable and computable. Every constraint reads specific named fields (`Value.scalar`), so
under `flatten` each constraint is a Boolean function of a known set of wires — exactly what
the circuit compiler (`RecordCircuit`) places onto `fieldOffset` columns.

The Heyting fragment (`anyOf` ⊔ / `not` ¬) realizes `Laws.predicate_heyting` (`dregg2 §1.5`).
Witnessed/sender/cross-cell (`boundDelta`) constraints are *declared* here and routed to their
seam downstream, exactly as dregg1's scalar evaluator defers `BoundDelta`/`Witnessed`.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able; imports `Exec.Value` and the (already-proved) orphaned
`Authority.ClearanceGraph` lattice primitive so the predicate language can express SGM-style
clearance mandates inline (`clearanceGe`, wired to `dominatesD`).

  path read from `segFields` (e.g. `["seg0","seg1",…]`) STARTS WITH `prefix : List Int`. The canonical
  nameservice policy "a subdomain may only be registered under a namespace the actor owns" — a structural
  prefix over the record substrate (each path segment is a named scalar). Fail-closed: a missing segment
  shorter than `prefix` ⇒ `false`. Mirrors the Rust datalog `feature_glob` path-prefix

  /-- **`senderIs k`** — turn-context atom (`docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §3): the turn's
  SENDER (the acting cell's identity, carried in `TurnCtx.sender`) must equal `k`. Mirrors
  `SimpleStateConstraint::SenderIs { pk }` (`cell/src/program.rs`). Composing it under `anyOf`
  with `immutable f` yields the per-slot ACTOR BINDING (`anyOf [immutable f, senderIs k]`:
  slot `f` flips only in a turn sent by `k` — the polis council's approval-slot tooth).
  FAIL-CLOSED in the ctx-less evaluator (mirrors Rust `MissingContextField`). -/
  | senderIs    (k : Int)
  /-- **`senderInField f`** — the turn's sender must equal the identity HELD in `new[f]`
  (the dynamic-owner binding; pin `f` with `immutable`/`writeOnce` and the cell carries its
  own controller). Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::SenderInSlot`. Fail-closed without ctx. -/

  record field) must be `≥ v`. Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::BalanceGte`. -/
  | balanceGe   (v : Int)
  /-- **`balanceLe v`** — the cell's own post-turn balance must be `≤ v`. `balanceLe 0` under
  a terminal-state guard is the "resolve drains the full balance" tooth. Mirrors
  `SimpleStateConstraint::BalanceLte`. -/
  | balanceLe   (v : Int)
  /-- **`preimageGate f`** — the turn must reveal a preimage whose HASH (computed by the §8
  crypto portal, carried as `TurnCtx.revealedHash`) equals the commitment held in `new[f]`.
  The `SimpleConstraint` placement is the point: the knowledge gate composes under
  `anyOf`/`not` (committed-escrow `state = RELEASED ⇒ reveal`). Mirrors
  `SimpleStateConstraint::PreimageGate`. -/
  | preimageGate (f : FieldName)
  /-- **`delegationEpochEquals f`** — the post-state slot `new[f]` equals the touched cell's
  own post-turn `delegation_epoch` (the R7 capability-freshness counter, carried in
  `TurnCtx.delegationEpoch`; Rust carrier: `TransitionMeta::delegation_epoch`, stamped PER
  CELL by the executor's program-check loop). THE atom that discharges the channel-group
  `DelegationEpochTie` premise (`Apps/ChannelGroup.lean`): the group's epoch slot ≡
  `delegation_epoch` becomes PROGRAM-ENFORCED, so forward-key darkness and capability
  staleness compose IN the program rather than via the canonical builders' out-of-band
  fail-closed checks (kept as defense-in-depth). FAIL-CLOSED on an absent stamp (legacy
  evaluators, ctx-less evaluation) and on an absent/ill-typed slot. Mirrors
  `SimpleStateConstraint::DelegationEpochEquals`. Admit-char:
  `evalSimpleCtx_delegationEpochEquals_iff`. -/
  | delegationEpochEquals (f : FieldName)
  /-- **`countGe m f`** — the count-≥ / order-statistic atom (in-program M-of-N): the turn's
  witness EXHIBITS an element set (`TurnCtx.exhibited`, the opaque-scalar reading of the
  unique Cleartext blob) whose §8-portal canonical sorted-set commitment
  (`TurnCtx.exhibitedCommit`, Rust `count_ge_set_commitment`) equals `new[f]`, and whose
  DISTINCT count (`List.eraseDups`) is `≥ m`.

  WHY THIS DOES NOT FAIL THE WAY THE POLIS `affineLe`-FLAG TRICK DID: summing flag slots
  breaks on unbounded counters — ONE slot inflated to `m` fakes the quorum arithmetic.
  Here NOTHING accumulates in state: the witness RE-EXHIBITS the full element set on every
  turn, distinctness is structural in the evaluator (`eraseDups` — a duplicate-padded
  exhibit collapses), and the set is bound to the slot commitment, so `m` cannot be
  counterfeited by arithmetic aliasing.

  HONEST SCOPE: the atom discharges "the committed set opens and has ≥ m distinct
  elements" — it does NOT bind each element to a live approver of THIS turn (per-element
  signatures are not in the scalar evaluator; the approval binding stays the polis
  actor-bound approval-slot ceremony feeding the committed set, and the commitment slot
  itself must be governance-written). FAIL-CLOSED on a missing/malformed witness (absent
  `exhibitedCommit`) and on an absent slot. Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::CountGe`.
  Admit-char: `evalSimpleCtx_countGe_iff`. -/
  | countGe (m : Nat) (f : FieldName)
  /-- **`senderMemberOf members`** (apps gap 3) — turn-context atom: the turn's SENDER
  (the acting cell's identity, carried in `TurnCtx.sender`) is a member of the literal id-set
  `members`. The CLEAN form of the `anyOf [senderIs a, senderIs b, …]` idiom a multi-admin board
  needs — one atom instead of a manually-enumerated disjunction (which an N-member board would have
  to widen by hand each time a member joins). Composing it under `anyOf` with `immutable f` gives
  the MULTI-admin actor binding: `anyOf [immutable f, senderMemberOf board]` — slot `f` flips only
  in a turn sent by SOMEONE on the board, the natural generalization of the single-key
  `anyOf [immutable f, senderIs k]` polis tooth. Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::SenderMemberOf
  { members }` (`cell/src/program.rs`); the Rust evaluator reads `ctx.sender` against the member
  list. COST (§8): FREE / i-confluent — a predicate over the single turn's own context with no
  cross-turn invariant (exactly the `senderIs` classification: a pk-equality, here a set-membership,
  decided entirely by the acting turn). FAIL-CLOSED in the ctx-less evaluator (`MissingContextField`)
  and on an empty/absent sender. Admit-char: `evalSimpleCtx_senderMemberOf_iff`. -/
  | senderMemberOf (members : List Int)
  /-- **`balanceDeltaLe max`** (apps gap 4) — turn-context atom: a RATE CEILING on the cell's
  OWN sealed kernel balance across the transition — `new.balance − old.balance ≤ max` (the delta
  twin of the absolute `balanceLe`). Reads BOTH the pre-turn balance (`TurnCtx.balanceBefore`) and
  the post-turn balance (`TurnCtx.balance`), the sealed kernel balances the executor holds at
  evaluation time — NOT record fields. A withdrawal-rate / spend-cap gate ("this cell may not GAIN
  more than `max` per turn"); paired with `balanceDeltaGe` it bounds the per-turn movement in both
  directions. Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::BalanceDeltaLte { max }` (`cell/src/program.rs`),
  reading `old_balance`/`new_balance` from the executor context. COST (§8): the BOUNDED / ordering
  pole — a rate-bound on a DECREMENTABLE quantity (the balance) is exactly the
  `bounded_resource_not_iconfluent` case the moment concurrent debits exist; single-cell serial
  execution makes it safe today (n=1 collapses the bound, per the single-machine principle), n>1
  forces ordering on the cell. NOT i-confluent. FAIL-CLOSED on an absent pre- OR post-balance.
  Admit-char: `evalSimpleCtx_balanceDeltaLe_iff`. -/
  | balanceDeltaLe (max : Int)
  /-- **`balanceDeltaGe min`** (apps gap 4) — turn-context atom: a RATE FLOOR on the cell's OWN
  sealed kernel balance across the transition — `new.balance − old.balance ≥ min` (the delta twin
  of the absolute `balanceGe`). Reads `TurnCtx.balanceBefore` and `TurnCtx.balance`. The lower-bound
  rate gate ("this cell may not LOSE more than `−min` per turn" when `min < 0`; "must gain at least
  `min`" when `min > 0`). Mirrors `SimpleStateConstraint::BalanceDeltaGte { min }`. COST (§8): the
  BOUNDED / ordering pole, same as `balanceDeltaLe` — a rate-bound on the decrementable balance,
  i-confluent only under the single serializer (n=1). NOT i-confluent. FAIL-CLOSED on an absent
  pre- OR post-balance. Admit-char: `evalSimpleCtx_balanceDeltaGe_iff`. -/
  | balanceDeltaGe (min : Int)
  /-- **`balanceDeltaLeField rateField`** (apps gap 3 — the FIELD-VALUED rate ceiling) — a rate
  bound whose limit is READ FROM A STATE FIELD, not a literal: admits iff `new.balance − old.balance ≤
  new[rateField]`. The `balanceDeltaLe` twin whose ceiling is a governed parameter rather than a baked
  constant — a TIER UPGRADE that raises `new[rateField]` raises the allowed per-turn movement WITHOUT a
  program rewrite (the seam both apps lanes hit: a plan stores its rate in a slot a governance turn can
  lift). Reads the sealed kernel balances (`TurnCtx.balanceBefore`/`TurnCtx.balance`, like
  `balanceDeltaLe`) AND the post-record's `rateField` scalar (`new.scalar rateField`). Mirrors a
  `SimpleStateConstraint::BalanceDeltaLteField { rate_field }` reading `old_balance`/`new_balance` from
  the executor context and `rate_field` from the post-state (the field-bound generalization of
  `BalanceDeltaLte`). COST (§8): the BOUNDED / ordering pole — a rate-bound on the decrementable balance
  is i-confluent only under the single serializer (n=1), exactly as `balanceDeltaLe`; the bound being a
  field-read (not a literal) does not change the confluence class. FAIL-CLOSED on an absent pre- OR
  post-balance, AND on an absent/ill-typed `rateField` (no rate ⇒ no allowance ⇒ reject — the
  conservative reading: a missing tier field grants ZERO rate, never an unbounded one). Admit-char:
  `evalSimpleCtx_balanceDeltaLeField_iff`. -/
  | balanceDeltaLeField (rateField : FieldName)
  /-- **`wakeOnResolve stateField resolvedValue badge`** (apps gap 4 — the PROGRAM-ENFORCED async
  wake) — the NOTIFY DUAL of the `balanceLe`-on-resolve drain tooth. A turn that drives `new[stateField]
  = resolvedValue` (a state machine reaching its RESOLVED/RELEASED terminal) MUST also have FIRED the
  async wake carrying `badge` — the executor's emitted-wake set (`TurnCtx.emittedWakes`, the badges the
  turn's `signal`s actually OR'd, the Rust carrier being the per-turn notify-emission log the executor
  accumulates while applying effects) must contain `badge`. Otherwise the turn is REJECTED. When the
  transition does NOT reach `resolvedValue` the clause is DORMANT (vacuously admitted) — exactly the
  `anyOf [.not (.fieldEquals state R), …]`-on-resolve shape, here for the wake instead of a balance
  bound.

  THE WELD: today the `notify` cap-algebra (`Firmament/NotifyAuthority.lean` `signalGated`/`NotifyCap`)
  is proved in a SEPARATE section from `RecordProgram`; *"a turn driving state→RESOLVED also fires the
  wake"* is DOCUMENTED, not enforced. This atom makes it a PROGRAM CLAUSE: the cell program REQUIRES the
  wake as a condition of admitting the resolving turn, so the state transition and the async signal are
  welded — a resolve that forgets to notify is UNSAT, the dual of a resolve that forgets to drain. The
  ctx carrier (`emittedWakes`) is the seam, exactly as `revealedHash`/`exhibitedCommit` carry the §8
  crypto-portal output without importing the crypto: the badge-OR object + the cap-gated `signalGated`
  stay in the firmament; this atom only witnesses that the wake WAS emitted in this turn.

  COST (§8): FREE / i-confluent — a predicate over the single turn's own emitted-wake set and post-state
  (no cross-turn invariant; the wake is a fact of THIS turn, like `senderIs`). FAIL-CLOSED on a resolving
  transition whose `emittedWakes` lacks the badge (the un-notified resolve), and in the ctx-less
  evaluator (no emitted-wake set ⇒ a resolving transition cannot witness the wake ⇒ reject). Admit-char:
  `evalSimpleCtx_wakeOnResolve_iff`. -/

/-- **A bound branch of an `anyOfBound` disjunction** (`docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §11.3).
The branch shape that lets a WITNESSED (proof-bearing) leaf sit beside a CHEAP (no-proof) leaf
under `⊔` WITHOUT the proof-stripping unsoundness §4 warns of: each witnessed branch names its OWN
proof carrier (here the `(sourceCell, sourceField)` it reads from `TurnCtx.observedFields` — the
exact §11.2 portal carrier), so "this branch needs a proof" is STRUCTURAL, and a stripped/absent
proof makes that branch FAIL rather than masquerade as a no-proof branch (`anyOfBound_stripped_proof_branch_fails`).

  * `Simple c` — the cheap leg: an ordinary `SimpleConstraint` (timeout, state guard, sender
    binding). No witness; evaluated by `evalSimpleCtx`. THIS is the "cheaper branch" §4 says a
    submitter would try to slide down.
  * `Witnessed localField sourceCell sourceField` — the proof-bearing leg: the cross-cell
    verified-observation leaf (`observedFieldEquals`) naming the peer read it needs. It admits ONLY
    when the §8 portal opened a genuinely-finalized `(sourceCell, sourceField)` value into the
    carrier (the Merkle-open + host root-authenticity check already discharged) AND `new[localField]`
    equals it — the SAME proven `observedFieldEquals` semantics, now as a disjunction branch.

WHY this is the witnessed shape and not e.g. `preimageGate`: `observedFieldEquals` is the one
witnessed leaf in this file whose carrier read is a `StateConstraint` (the §4 discipline keeps it
out of the composable `SimpleConstraint` fragment), and whose anti-forge tooth
(`evalConstraintCtx_observedFieldEquals_absent_proof_refuses`) is already proved — the anti-strip
tooth REDUCES to it. Mirrors Rust `BoundBranch::{Simple, Witnessed { wp }}` (`cell/src/program.rs`),

  workflow-prerequisite predicate "this step is admissible only if a prerequisite marker is reached"
  (CWM advance / SGM admit), reusing the proved-sound `ClearanceGraph.dominatesD`. Distinct from

  /-- **`affineDeltaLe terms c`** (apps gap 2) — a genuine MULTI-FIELD DELTA gate across the
  `(old, new)` transition: `Σ cᵢ·(new[fᵢ] − old[fᵢ]) ≤ c`. Reads BOTH the old and new records and
  combines several field deltas in one affine bound — what the single-field `deltaBounded` /
  `fieldDelta` CANNOT express. The real budget-delta / rate gate: e.g. a treasury cell with two
  spend slots `out_a`, `out_b` bounds the COMBINED outflow per turn,
  `[(1,"out_a"),(1,"out_b")] ≤ budget` over the deltas; or a weighted basket `2·Δprice − Δindex ≤ k`.
  Distinct from the post-state-only `affineLe` (a band on the new record) and from `sumEqualsAcross`
  (an intra-cell conservation equation): this is a one-sided affine inequality on the DIFFERENCES.
  Maps to a PLONK linear gate over the `(old, new)` wire pair. FAIL-CLOSED: any absent/ill-typed
  term field on EITHER side ⇒ `false` (the delta is not evaluable). COST (§8): the BOUNDED /
  ordering pole — a bound on per-turn CHANGE of (generally decrementable) quantities is the
  `bounded_resource_not_iconfluent` case under concurrent writers; single-cell serial execution
  keeps it safe today (n=1), n>1 forces ordering. NOT i-confluent (a rate gate is never

  /-- **`affineDeltaLeField terms rateField`** (apps gap 3 — the FIELD-VALUED multi-field rate gate):
  `Σ cᵢ·(new[fᵢ] − old[fᵢ]) ≤ new[rateField]`. The `affineDeltaLe` twin whose bound is READ FROM A
  STATE FIELD instead of being a baked literal — the general record-only rate gate a tier upgrade can
  lift by raising `new[rateField]` (no program rewrite). Subsumes the single-field balance-record rate
  as `affineDeltaLeField [(1, "balance")] rateField`, and the combined-outflow budget as
  `affineDeltaLeField [(1,"out_a"),(1,"out_b")] "budget"`. Distinct from the literal-bound `affineDeltaLe`
  (its `c` is now a slot read) and from `affineDeltaLe` over a fixed `c`: here the ceiling itself is

  §11.2 — the cross-cell verified-observation atom) — admits IFF `new[localField]` equals the value
  field `sourceField` held by the PEER cell `sourceCell` at a FINALIZED state-commitment root. The
  witnessed cross-cell read: a market cell gates on an oracle cell's finalized price, a governance
  cell on a constitution cell's finalized membership. THE rung that makes a polis amendment
  PROPAGATE — "my threshold IS constitution v3's threshold" as a live, verified fact instead of a
  parameter copied (and frozen) at birth (polis gap 2 / §8 `imports`, now a program tooth).

  WHY THIS IS A `StateConstraint`, NOT A liftable `SimpleConstraint`: it joins the WITNESSED family
  (`preimageGate`/`countGe`), whose proof-binding does NOT survive naive disjunction (the §4
  discipline — an `anyOf` branch that fails to open a proof must be distinguishable from one that
  needs none). So it stays out of the composable simple fragment, exactly as in Rust
  (`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`, NOT a `SimpleStateConstraint`).

  THE CARRIER (the §8 crypto-portal seam, exactly as `revealedHash`/`exhibitedCommit`): the portal
  hands the evaluator `TurnCtx.observedFields : List (Int × FieldName × Int)` — the
  `(peerCell, peerField, value)` triples it OPENED against genuinely-finalized peer roots (a cell
  identity is modelled as the `Int` scalar `senderIs`/`senderMemberOf` use). The
  Merkle-open against the peer's finalized `at_root` AND the host root-authority check that `at_root`
  is a real finalized commitment of `sourceCell` (the `IssuerRootAuthority` precedent —
  `cell/src/predicate.rs`, where the BlindedSet self-fabrication forge is closed by the host
  installing "which roots are real") live IN the portal; this atom only witnesses that the opened
  triple is present and that `new[localField]` matches its value. Verification is recomputation
  against the receipt chain — what verifiers already do, minus the archaeology.

  COST (§8): FREE / i-confluent — a FINALIZED read is a MONOTONE, already-committed fact (a finalized
  value never un-finalizes), the `monotone_terminal` confluence-keeping case, NOT the live-read
  ordering pole. THAT distinction (finalized vs live) is exactly WHY this rung is admissible where a
  LIVE cross-cell read is not: a guard reading the peer's CURRENT state would make every turn on this
  cell order against every turn on that cell (`relational_decided_by_merge` with a non-local
  relation — coordination, always), which is why `boundDelta` stays deferred and a live read stays
  OUT of the language. Disclosure is the peer's finalized value (already public on the chain).

  FAIL-CLOSED: a missing opened triple for `(sourceCell, sourceField)` in the carrier (no proof, or
  a root the host authority rejected, so the portal handed nothing) ⇒ `false`; an absent/ill-typed
  `localField` ⇒ `false`; the ctx-LESS evaluator (no carrier in scope) ⇒ `false`. Admit-char:
  `evalConstraintCtx_observedFieldEquals_iff`. -/

  /-- **`anyOfBound branches`** (`docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §11.3 — witnessed branches under ⊔):
  single-level disjunction over `BoundBranch`es — admits IFF SOME branch admits (`branches.any`).
  The rung that lets a real escrow/governance ceremony express "release if EITHER the timeout passed
  OR a credential/finalized-read proof verifies" — a WITNESSED branch beside a CHEAP branch — which
  the plain `anyOf` (`SimpleConstraint`-only) cannot, because proof-bearing leaves do not survive a
  naive lift (§4: an `anyOf` branch that fails to open a proof must be DISTINGUISHABLE from one that
  needs none, or a submitter strips the proof and slides down the cheap branch).

  THE SOUNDNESS CORE (`anyOfBound_stripped_proof_branch_fails`): a witnessed branch whose proof
  carrier is ABSENT/invalid (the portal opened no triple for its `(sourceCell, sourceField)` — a
  stripped or rejected proof) does NOT admit. It cannot masquerade as a no-proof branch: the
  `BoundBranch.witnessed` shape STRUCTURALLY demands the opened triple, exactly as the Rust witnessed
  branch's own `proof_witness_index` + the unique-blob scan bind its blob. So a proof-strip closes
  the witnessed branch rather than opening a cheaper path; the only branches a stripped turn can take
  are the genuinely cheap `simple` ones, which is the intended semantics.

  Reads `TurnCtx` (the witnessed branches consult `observedFields`, the simple branches consult
  `sender`/`balance`/…), so the cross-cell witnessed seam stays in `evalConstraintCtx`; the ctx-less
  `evalConstraint` arm FAILS CLOSED (the witnessed-family ctx-less rejection — `evalConstraintCtx_empty`
  proves the two agree). COST (§5/§8): the MAX of the branch costs — a disjunction is as coordinated
  as its most-coordinated TAKEN branch (a cheap `simple` branch is free; a witnessed `observedFieldEquals`
  branch is the FREE finalized-read class; an ordering-pole branch makes the whole gate ordering when
  taken); disclosure is the union of what the taken branch reveals. Mirrors Rust
  `StateConstraint::AnyOfBound { branches }` (`cell/src/program.rs`); the evaluator arm calls the
  EXISTING `evaluate_simple_constraint` / witnessed-predicate verification (the gate CALLS the
  evaluator the executor already owns — no new semantics). APPENDED (so existing serialized programs,
  factory VKs, and content addresses stay byte-identical, §2). Admit-char: `evalConstraint_anyOfBound_iff`. -/

The Rust executor evaluates every cell program with an `EvalContext` (the turn's sender = the
acting cell's public key, the height, the epoch) and against the post-state `CellState`, whose
SEALED balance rides along. `TurnCtx` mirrors exactly the slice of that context the new
turn-context atoms read; `evalSimpleCtx` / `evalConstraintCtx` / `RecordProgram.admitsCtx` are
the ctx-aware evaluators (mirroring `evaluate_constraint_full` with `Some(ctx)`,

case — `evalSimpleCtx_empty` is the conservative-extension keystone, so every existing theorem
over `evalSimple`/`admits` (the guard-theorem family, `stateStepGuarded_*` via `caveatsAdmit`)
is untouched and the new atoms ONLY ADD admissibility distinctions when a context is present. -/

/-- The turn-context slice the context atoms read. `sender` = the acting cell's identity
(`EvalContext::sender`); `balance` = the touched cell's own post-turn sealed balance
(`CellState::balance`); `revealedHash` = the §8-portal hash of the turn's revealed preimage

  /-- The touched cell's OWN PRE-turn sealed kernel balance (`CellState::balance` BEFORE the
  effect applied), the `balance` field's old-side twin. The executor holds both the pre- and
  post-turn balance at program-check time (Rust carrier: the journal's pre-image / the cell's
  prior `balance`); the rate atoms `balanceDeltaLe`/`balanceDeltaGe` read `new.balance − old.balance`
  from `(balance, balanceBefore)`. APPENDED (so existing `TurnCtx { … }` literals and the empty
  context are unchanged — absence FAILS CLOSED, the delta atoms refuse). -/
  balanceBefore : Option Int := none

  counter), stamped PER CELL by the executor's program-check loop. Rust carrier:
  `TransitionMeta::delegation_epoch` (per-cell, unlike the per-action `EvalContext`) —
  this `TurnCtx` models exactly the slice of executor context the atoms read, so it lands
  here. Absence FAILS CLOSED (`delegationEpochEquals` refuses). -/
  delegationEpoch : Option Int := none
  /-- The witness-exhibited element set for `countGe` (the opaque-scalar reading of the
  unique Cleartext blob, Rust postcard `Vec<[u8;32]>`). RE-EXHIBITED on every turn —
  nothing accumulates in state (the anti-`affineLe`-flag design). -/
  exhibited : List Int := []
  /-- The §8-portal canonical sorted-set commitment of the DEDUPED exhibited set (Rust
  `count_ge_set_commitment` — BLAKE3 over the length-prefixed sorted elements). Like
  `revealedHash` for `preimageGate`, the hash binding itself is the crypto portal; the
  ordering/counting laws are proved here. Absence fails closed. -/
  exhibitedCommit : Option Int := none
  /-- The badges the turn's async wakes ACTUALLY fired (`wakeOnResolve`, apps gap 4): the
  emitted-wake set the executor accumulates while applying the turn's effects (each cap-gated
  `Firmament.NotifyAuthority.signalGated` that COMMITTED OR'd its masked badge; this is the per-turn
  log of those badges). The seam that lets a cell PROGRAM require an async wake on a state transition
  WITHOUT importing the firmament's notify object — exactly as `revealedHash`/`exhibitedCommit` carry a
  §8 crypto-portal output. APPENDED (so existing `TurnCtx { … }` literals and the empty context are
  unchanged); a resolving transition whose required badge is absent here FAILS CLOSED. -/
  emittedWakes : List Int := []
  /-- The cross-cell FINALIZED-read triples the §8 crypto portal OPENED for this turn
  (`observedFieldEquals`, `docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §11.2): each `(peerCell, peerField, value)`
  is a `(sourceCell, sourceField)` the portal opened against a GENUINELY-FINALIZED peer root AND
  whose root the host root-authority (`IssuerRootAuthority`, `cell/src/predicate.rs`) confirmed is a
  real finalized commitment of that peer. The Merkle-open and the root-authenticity check stay in the
  portal; this carrier is exactly its output, exactly as `revealedHash`/`exhibitedCommit` carry a §8
  portal output WITHOUT importing the crypto. RE-EXHIBITED per turn (a finalized fact is monotone, so
  re-reading it every turn is the `monotone_terminal` confluence-keeping case — the FREE cost class).
  A `(sourceCell, sourceField)` ABSENT here (no proof, or a root the host rejected) FAILS CLOSED:
  `observedFieldEquals` cannot be satisfied without the opened triple. APPENDED (so existing

/-! ### THE cross-cell verified-observation keystone (`docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §11.2).

`observedFieldEquals localField sourceCell sourceField` is the WITNESSED cross-cell read: a market
gates on an oracle's finalized price, a governance cell on a constitution's finalized membership.
The §8 crypto portal does the Merkle-open against the peer's finalized root AND the host
root-authority check (`IssuerRootAuthority`), handing the evaluator the opened
`(peerCell, peerField, value)` triples in `TurnCtx.observedFields`. THE ORDERING LAW — that the
admitted turn's `new[localField]` equals the peer's finalized value — is proved HERE. -/

/-- **`observedFieldEquals` admit-char (THE keystone).** Admits IFF the §8 portal opened a finalized
value `v` for `(sourceCell, sourceField)` (the triple is in the carrier — so the Merkle-open against
the peer's finalized root AND the host root-authenticity check already passed) AND

"my `localField` IS `sourceCell`'s finalized `sourceField`." -/

/-! ### THE `anyOfBound` keystones (`docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` §11.3 — witnessed branches under ⊔).

`anyOfBound branches` is the disjunction that lets a WITNESSED (proof-bearing) leaf sit beside a
CHEAP (no-proof) leaf under `⊔`. The admit-characterization is "admits IFF SOME branch admits"
(`branches.any`); THE soundness core is `anyOfBound_stripped_proof_branch_fails` — a witnessed branch
whose proof carrier is absent/invalid (the §8 portal opened no triple for its `(sourceCell,
sourceField)`) does NOT admit, so a stripped proof closes the witnessed branch rather than opening a
cheaper path. The anti-strip tooth REDUCES to the already-proved
`evalConstraintCtx_observedFieldEquals_absent_proof_refuses`: the `witnessed` branch's evaluator IS
the `observedFieldEquals` arm. -/

/-- **`evalConstraint_anyOfBound_iff` (the admit-characterization).** The ctx-aware disjunction
admits IFF SOME branch admits. The Heyting `⊔` over `BoundBranch`es — the §11.3 rung's defining law. -/

  simp only [evalConstraintCtx, List.any_eq_true]

/-- **A witnessed branch with an ABSENT proof carrier fails closed (the per-branch anti-strip).** When
the §8 portal opened no triple for `(sourceCell, sourceField)` — a stripped or host-rejected proof —
the `witnessed` branch does NOT admit. It cannot masquerade as a no-proof branch: the
`BoundBranch.witnessed` shape STRUCTURALLY demands the opened triple. Reduces, definitionally, to the
`observedFieldEquals` anti-forge tooth (`evalConstraintCtx_observedFieldEquals_absent_proof_refuses`),
because the witnessed branch's evaluator IS that arm. -/

  rw [h]

/-- **THE anti-strip tooth (`anyOfBound_stripped_proof_branch_fails`) — the soundness core of §11.3.**
An `anyOfBound` whose branches are ALL witnessed cross-cell reads, EVERY one of whose proofs is
stripped/rejected (the portal opened no triple for any branch's `(sourceCell, sourceField)`), does
NOT admit. The §4 unsoundness — a submitter strips a proof to slide down a *cheaper* branch — is
closed: a stripped witnessed branch FAILS (it cannot masquerade as a no-proof `simple` branch),
so the only branches a stripped turn can take are the genuinely-cheap `simple` ones (here there are
none, so the whole gate refuses). This is the keystone the design hangs on: if it could not be
proved, the witnessed-branch binding would be decorative. -/

/-! ## Heap-keyed constraint atoms (THE ROTATION's app-state lane).

The rotation's register economics — "registers are the L1; apps live in the heap" — needs cell
programs that CONSTRAIN heap fields, not just the 8 reserved slots. The Rust executor already
ADMITS heap writes (`SetField` with index `≥ STATE_SLOTS` routes into `CellState.fields_map`,
commit `b133354fc`); this section gives the constraint language its heap-keyed atoms.

**The design is a LIFT, not a new vocabulary.** This record substrate is already name-keyed and
`Option`-valued (`Value.scalar : Value → FieldName → Option Int`), so a heap field IS a field:
the canonical encoding `heapKey k` (= `FieldsMap.userKey`, base-10; welded by
`FieldsMap.userKey_eq_heapKey`) names heap key `k`, and a heap-keyed constraint is the EXISTING
name-keyed atom instantiated at that name. `HeapAtom` is the index-free residue of the slot-atom
vocabulary; `HeapAtom.lift k` interprets it into `SimpleConstraint`. Consequences, all free:

  * every existing admit-characterization (`evalSimple_strictMono_iff`, `evalSimple_memberOf_iff`,
    …) applies to heap-keyed constraints VERBATIM (witnessed below by the one-line reuse proofs);
  * the Heyting fragment composes: `not (a.lift k)`, `anyOf [a.lift k, .senderIs pk]` — the
    per-HEAP-field actor binding reuses the `actorBound_*` theorems at `f := heapKey k`
    (`heapActorBound_flip_requires_sender`);
  * the WP/VCG catalog (`Proof/WPCatalog.lean`) and the circuit compiler consume heap-keyed
    programs with NO new cases (a lifted atom is a `.simple` constraint).

**Absence semantics are the record substrate's `Option` reads, now load-bearing** (the heap is
partial where slots are total): post-state atoms (`equals`/`ge`/`le`/`memberOf`/
`inRangeTwoSided`) FAIL CLOSED on an absent post-state key; relational atoms
(`monotonic`/`strictMono`/`deltaBounded`) FAIL CLOSED on an absent key on EITHER side — there is
NO init escape on the heap, unlike the Rust slot twins' `(old_state = None, nonce = 0)` carve-out;
`immutable` admits the FIRST write (absent-old) and then pins — including REFUSING erasure;
`writeOnce` admits on absent-old or zero-old, then freezes. Each clause is a THEOREM below
(`evalHeap_*_absent_*` / `_pinned` / `_frozen`), not a comment.

Rust mirror: `SimpleStateConstraint::HeapField`/`StateConstraint::HeapField { key, atom }` +
`evaluate_heap_atom` (`cell/src/program.rs`), reading `CellState::get_field_ext` (`Option`-valued,
exactly `Value.scalar` at `heapKey k`). -/

/-- **`heapKey k`** — the canonical `FieldName` for heap key `k` (base-10, the
`FieldsMap.userKey` encoding; `FieldsMap.userKey_eq_heapKey` is `rfl`). Keys `≥ reservedKeys`
are the user heap; low keys name the reserved registers under the same encoding. -/
def heapKey (k : Nat) : FieldName := toString k

/-- **`HeapAtom`** — the index-free residue of the slot-atom vocabulary, liftable over any heap
key. Deliberately NOT recursive: negation/disjunction come from lifting into the existing
Heyting fragment (`.not (a.lift k)`, `anyOf [a.lift k, …]`). Mirrors Rust
`cell/src/program.rs::HeapAtom` field-for-field. (Distinct from
`Substrate.HeapKernel.HeapAtom`, the heap-WRITE guard literals; these are cell-program
constraint atoms over the heap-backed fields of `(old, new)`.) -/

  of `deltaBounded` (which only bounds `|Δ|`): pins the change to a precise value, so a heap-keyed
  quantity can require "moved by EXACTLY `d`". Lifts to `SimpleConstraint.fieldDelta` (which is
  `new = old + d`, both-present-refuse). Rust twin: `HeapAtom::DeltaEquals { d }`
