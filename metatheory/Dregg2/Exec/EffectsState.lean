# Dregg2.Exec.EffectsState — the NEUTRAL / MONOTONIC / TERMINAL non-balance regime.

**Sibling of `Exec/EffectTransfer.lean` (the REFERENCE TEMPLATE).** Where `EffectTransfer` drives
the prototypical *Conservative*/`Paired` effect (a gated debit/credit, `Σδ = 0`) all the way
through the executor layers, THIS module drives the dregg1 effects that carry **no balance delta**:
the field/state/lifecycle mutations whose `LinearityClass` color (`turn/src/action.rs
Effect::linearity`, mirrored in `CatalogInstances.effectLinearity`) is `Neutral`, `Monotonic`, or
`Terminal`. For these the conserved `balance` domain measure (`RecordKernel.recTotal`) is UNCHANGED
and the authority graph (`Spec.execGraph`) is UNCHANGED; only the METADATA domain advances (a field
write, a counter bump, a lifecycle flag set). So — as `EffectTransfer §0` foretells — the BESPOKE
work per effect is "the domain-specific field-write semantics + its non-interference lemma": the
write touches a named metadata field and PROVABLY does not perturb the conserved balance.

## The effects covered (Neutral / Monotonic / Terminal, the non-balance ones)

DISCOVERED from `turn/src/action.rs` (`Effect` enum) ∩ `CatalogInstances.effectLinearity` coloring:

  * **Neutral** (`effectLinearity .x = Neutral`): `SetField`, `SetVerificationKey`
    (`setVerificationKey`), `EmitEvent`, `RefreshDelegation`, `PipelinedSend`,
    `ExerciseViaCapability`, plus `SetPermissions`. No resource delta — pure book-keeping.
  * **Monotonic** (`= Monotonic`): `IncrementNonce`, `ExportSturdyRef`, `EnlivenRef`,
    `ValidateHandoff`, `Refusal`. A scalar counter that only grows.
  * **Terminal** (`= Terminal`): `Seal`/`Unseal` (`cellSeal`/`cellUnseal`), `MakeSovereign`,
    `CellDestroy`, `ReceiptArchive`, `DropRef`, `RevokeDelegation`, `AttenuateCapability`,
    `RevokeCapability`. A one-way lifecycle transition with no inverse.

We model the common shape once (a named-field write on the record cell) and instantiate it for the
three representative families, proving for EACH the FIVE-keystone pattern, specialized for the
non-balance regime:
  (a) exec semantics — the field/state/flag write over the record kernel state;
  (b) conserves — balance UNCHANGED (the load-bearing NON-INTERFERENCE lemma: a metadata write
      doesn't touch `balOf`, like `EffectTransfer.setNonce_balOf`) ∧ authority UNCHANGED;
  (c) authorized — the actor held authority over the target (reusing the cap gate);
  (d) metadata — what advances (field set / counter bumped / lifecycle flag raised);
  (e) forward-sim — `AbsStep (absS s) (absS s')`: the abstract balance total is conserved and the
      authority graph is unchanged (the Neutral/metadata bottom edge of the simulation square).

Terminal effects additionally carry an **irreversibility-shaped** obligation (the `Terminal` color
has no inverse): once the lifecycle flag is set it stays set under idempotent re-application, and a
sealed cell rejects a second seal — the executable shadow of `LinearityClass::Terminal`.

Reuses ONLY the already-built
`Exec.TurnExecutor`/`Exec.RecordKernel`/`Spec.ExecRefinement` primitives. Verified standalone:

/-! ## §0 — The generic named-field write, and its NON-INTERFERENCE with the balance measure.

Every Neutral/Monotonic/Terminal effect of this module mutates a NAMED field of the
content-addressed record (a state field, a counter, a lifecycle flag) that is DISTINCT from the
conserved `balance` field. So the single bespoke fact each instantiates is: **a write to a field
`f ≠ "balance"` leaves `balOf` unchanged**. We prove this ONCE for a generic field name `f` (with
the side-condition `f ≠ balanceField`) and a generic value, then every concrete effect specializes
`f`. This is the `EffectTransfer.setNonce_balOf` non-interference lemma, generalized over the field.

The field write reuses EXACTLY the `RecordKernel.setBalance` shape (overwrite-in-place on a record,
singleton on a non-record), parameterized by the field name. -/

/-- Write the named field `f` of a record cell to `v` (overwriting in place; a non-record value
becomes a singleton `f` record). Touches ONLY field `f`. The generic named-field write — the
`f`-parameterized analog of `RecordKernel.setBalance` / `EffectTransfer.setNonce`. -/

/-! ## §1 — The Neutral/metadata STEP over the record kernel, and its balance/authority frame.

A Neutral/Monotonic/Terminal effect, unlike Transfer, runs NO gated debit/credit — it is a PURE
named-field write on one cell (`target`), gated only by authority (the actor must own/hold the
target). We model the kernel move as: check authority over the target, then write field `f` of the
target cell to `v`, then append a receipt to the chain (the monotone metadata advance every
committed action carries). The cap table and account set are UNTOUCHED. -/

/-- The authority gate for a self-targeted Neutral/Monotonic/Terminal effect: the actor must hold
authority over the `target` cell. Reuses `RecordKernel.authorizedB` with `src = dst = target`
(the canonical "act on my own cell" turn shape — a field write is not a cross-cell move). -/
def stateAuthB (caps : Caps) (actor target : CellId) : Bool :=
  authorizedB caps { actor := actor, src := target, dst := target, amt := 0 }

/-- **`cellLive k target` — the LIFECYCLE-LIVENESS gate (the R6 fix, defined LOCALLY).** Does
`target`'s lifecycle state admit new effects? `true` only for the Live discriminant (`0`); a Sealed
(`1`) or Destroyed (`3`) cell is fail-closed REJECTED. This is the bare-kernel-level twin of
`TurnExecutorFull.acceptsEffects` (dregg1's `CellLifecycle::accepts_effects`, `lifecycle.rs:109`),
defined HERE because `EffectsState` is imported BY `TurnExecutorFull` (so it cannot import it back
without a cycle). It reads only the `RecordKernelState.lifecycle` side-table — the SAME `0`=Live
discriminant `acceptsEffects` checks, so the two predicates are definitionally interchangeable at the
cutover. Closing R6: a state write into a non-Live cell now FAILS in the live executor. -/
def cellLive (k : RecordKernelState) (target : CellId) : Bool := k.lifecycle target == 0

/-- Write field `f` of `target` to `v` in the kernel state (the bespoke field-write semantics);
every other cell untouched. The metadata-domain move shared by all Neutral/Monotonic/Terminal
effects (a state set, a counter bump, a lifecycle flag). -/
def writeField (k : RecordKernelState) (f : FieldName) (target : CellId) (v : Value) :
    RecordKernelState :=
  { k with cell := fun c => if c = target then setField f (k.cell c) v else k.cell c }

/-- **`stateStep` — the executable semantics of a Neutral/Monotonic/Terminal effect (PROVED
computable).** Fail-closed: commits only when the actor holds authority over `target`, `target` is
a live account (MEMBERSHIP), AND `target`'s lifecycle admits new effects (LIVENESS — `cellLive`, the
R6 fix). On commit, write field `f` of `target` to `v` and extend the receipt chain by one row
(the metadata advance). NO balance move, NO cap edit — the regime invariant.

**R6 — lifecycle liveness now gates the LIVE executor.** Previously the gate consulted only authority
+ membership (`target ∈ accounts`), so a field write into a SEALED/Destroyed cell silently COMMITTED
(bypassing `cellSeal`). The `cellLive` conjunct closes that hole HERE, in the bare step the live
executor (`execFullA`'s `.incrementNonceA`/`.setPermissionsA`/`.setVKA`/`.refusalA`/`.receiptArchiveA`
arms, and — via `stateStepGuarded` — `.setFieldA`) runs: a write into a non-Live cell now returns
`none`, matching the handler's `acceptsEffects` gate. -/
def stateStep (s : RecChainedState) (f : FieldName) (actor target : CellId) (v : Value) :
    Option RecChainedState :=

           log    := { actor := actor, src := target, dst := target, amt := 0 } :: s.log }
  else
    none

/-- **`stateStep_factors` — PROVED.** A committed `stateStep` was authorized and produced exactly
the field-write post-state + a one-row chain extension. The live-target gate is exposed separately by
`state_target_live`. The bridge every downstream theorem reuses. -/

/-! ## §1.5 — SLOT-CAVEAT ENFORCEMENT: the caveat-gated field write (the foundation of app-safety).

`stateStep` does a plain *authorized* field write — but a factory-minted cell carries per-slot
caveats (`RecordKernel.SlotCaveat`, dregg1's `FactoryDescriptor.program`) that the executor checks
on EVERY `SetField` (`apply_set_field` → `RecordProgram::evaluate`, `cell/src/program.rs:1314`+).
`stateStepGuarded` is the caveat-gated field write: it consults `s.kernel.slotCaveats target` and
COMMITS the very same `stateStep` post-state ONLY when EVERY caveat bound to the written slot is
satisfied by the `(actor, old, new)` transition — otherwise it FAILS CLOSED (`none`).

Because a satisfying write commits EXACTLY `stateStep`'s post-state, ALL of §2–§5's
conservation/authority/forward-sim lemmas lift to `stateStepGuarded` for free (`stateStepGuarded_eq`
below): the caveat gate can only ever TIGHTEN `stateStep`, never move balance or edit caps. This is
what makes a published app-safety REAL — a `nameservice` `Immutable`-owner slot is *registered
forever* because THIS gate rejects any later rewrite, BY THE EXECUTOR. -/

/-- Do ALL caveats bound to slot `f` on cell `target` admit the write of new scalar `new` by `actor`
(against the slot's committed value, read as `fieldOf f (k.cell target)` defaulting absent to `0` —
dregg1's `FIELD_ZERO`)? Caveats on OTHER slots are irrelevant to this write (filtered out). Computable,
decidable, FAIL-CLOSED. Mirrors dregg1's per-slot `RecordProgram::evaluate` filtered to the touched
field. -/
def caveatsAdmit (k : RecordKernelState) (f : FieldName) (actor target : CellId) (new : Int) : Bool :=
  ((k.slotCaveats target).filter (fun cav => cav.field == f)).all
    (fun cav => cav.eval actor (fieldOf f (k.cell target)) new)

/-- **`stateStepGuarded` — the CAVEAT-GATED field write (PROVED computable).** First the authority
gate (`stateStep`), then the slot-caveat gate (`caveatsAdmit`): a write commits iff the actor holds
authority over `target` AND every caveat bound to the written slot admits the `(actor, old, new)`
transition. Fail-closed on EITHER gate. On commit the post-state is EXACTLY `stateStep`'s — the
caveat check only DECIDES, it never mutates extra state. The executable shadow of dregg1's
`apply_set_field` → `RecordProgram::evaluate` (`cell/src/program.rs:1314`+). -/

rejects a non-`+1` write, a `WriteOnce` slot rejects a second write. -/

/-! ## §2 — `state_conserves`: balance UNCHANGED ∧ authority UNCHANGED (the regime invariant).

The Neutral/metadata regime's defining obligation: a non-balance effect's tri-domain reading is

total is unchanged via the §0 non-interference lemma, and the cap table / authority graph are
untouched (the field write never edits `caps`). -/

/-! ## §5 — `state_forward_sim`: the REFINEMENT (forward-simulation square), Neutral regime.

A committed Neutral/metadata effect is matched by an abstract `Spec` step: the abstract balance
total is CONSERVED (`Δ = 0`) and the authority graph is UNCHANGED — the Neutral/metadata bottom
edge of the simulation square (the `EffectTransfer §5` shape, here with BOTH conserved-domain
deltas zero rather than a paired cancellation). -/

/-! ## §6 — TERMINAL effects: the irreversibility-shaped obligation (`LinearityClass::Terminal`).

The `Terminal` color (seal/destroy/makeSovereign/drop/revoke) has NO inverse: the lifecycle flag,
once raised, stays raised. We model a terminal lifecycle flag as a named scalar field whose `1`
encodes "sealed/destroyed/sovereign". The irreversibility obligations:
  * `seal` raises the flag to `1` (`sealField → 1`);
  * a SECOND seal of an already-sealed cell is REJECTED (the one-way gate — no double-seal);
  * the flag is IDEMPOTENT under re-writing `1` (raising-an-already-raised flag is a no-op on the
    field value — there is no path back to `0` through `sealStep`).
This is the executable shadow of `lifecycle::CellLifecycle::is_terminal`. -/

one-way lifecycle transition. -/

/-! ## §8 — VK material is a Prop-carrier portal (note).

`SetVerificationKey` writes the cell's verification-key material. In dregg1 the VK is cryptographic
(an Ed25519 / STARK VK); in this metatheory it rides the `Verifiable Statement Witness` portal seam
(the `Spec.Guard.witnessed` route — cf. `CatalogInstances §2`'s `signature`/`proof` guards). At the
EXECUTABLE record-cell layer modelled here, `SetVerificationKey` is just a Neutral named-field write
(`setVerificationKey_is_neutral`): it sets a field, conserves balance + authority, advances
metadata — exactly `stateStep`. The cryptographic content of the VK is OFF this layer, behind the
§8 Prop-carrier portal, so no crypto obligation is incurred here. -/

/-! ## §6.5 — The guarded field write inherits the regime invariants (lifted via `stateStepGuarded_eq`).

A committed `stateStepGuarded` IS a committed `stateStep` (the caveat gate only restricts the
domain), so it preserves balance, leaves the authority graph fixed, advances the metadata clock, and
writes the field — VERBATIM the §2–§5 keystones, lifted through `stateStepGuarded_eq`. -/

/-- **`guarded_state_conserves` — BALANCE UNCHANGED (PROVED).** A committed caveat-gated field write

The cutover finding, evaluated. `ssR6` is `ss0` with cell 0's LIFECYCLE side-table flipped to Sealed
(`1`) — the cell still EXISTS (`0 ∈ accounts`) and the actor still OWNS it (so authority + membership
both pass), but its lifecycle no longer admits effects. Previously the live `stateStep` gated ONLY on
authority + membership, so this write COMMITTED (the R6 hole — a write bypassing `cellSeal`). With the
`cellLive` gate it now returns `none`, matching the handler's `acceptsEffects`. A LIVE sibling cell
(cell 1, lifecycle `0`) still accepts the same write — the gate only TIGHTENS the non-live case. -/
def ssR6 : RecChainedState :=
  { ss0 with kernel := { ss0.kernel with lifecycle := fun c => if c = 0 then 1 else 0 } }

-- A field write into the now-SEALED cell 0 is REJECTED (R6 CLOSED) — was `true` (the LIVE HOLE):
#guard ((stateStep ssR6 "status" 0 0 (.int 7)).isSome) == false  --  false (R6 CLOSED)
-- ...even though authority + membership STILL hold (the cell exists and the actor owns it):
#guard ((stateAuthB ssR6.kernel.caps 0 0 && decide (0 ∈ ssR6.kernel.accounts)))  --  true
-- A write into a LIVE sibling (cell 1, lifecycle 0) still COMMITS — the gate only tightens non-live:
#guard ((stateStep ssR6 "balance2" 1 1 (.int 7)).isSome)  --  true (live cell ok)
-- A nonce write (the live executor's `.incrementNonceA` arm) into the Sealed cell is REJECTED too:
#guard ((stateStep ssR6 "nonce" 0 0 (.int 1)).isSome) == false  --  false (R6 CLOSED)
-- And the guarded `.setFieldA` path inherits it (a Sealed cell rejects even a caveat-clean write):
#guard ((stateStepGuarded ssR6 "freeField" 0 0 99).isSome) == false  --  false (R6 CLOSED)

/-! ## §11.SGM — A REAL SGM CLEARANCE MANDATE, enforced INLINE by the live `setFieldA` leg.

The de-stodgify beachhead (design D0): the orphaned-but-proved `ClearanceGraph.dominatesD` lattice
is now wired into the executor-enforced `SlotCaveat` surface (`SlotCaveat.clearanceGe`). A cell slot
`secret` is bound with a clearance mandate: it may be written ONLY by an actor whose clearance label
DOMINATES the slot's sensitivity `mid` in a three-level ladder `top ⊐ mid ⊐ low`. The published
clearance table is `actor 0 ↦ top(3)`, `actor 1 ↦ mid(2)`, `actor 2 ↦ low(1)`. Because `setFieldA`
routes through `stateStepGuarded`→`caveatsAdmit`→`SlotCaveat.eval`, an under-cleared actor's write is
REJECTED BY THE VERIFIED EXECUTOR — not by an out-of-band app mandate. This is ember's named blocked
policy ("a write to slot `s` is admitted only if `actor`'s clearance dominates `s`'s sensitivity"),
now enforceable inline. -/

/-- A chained state whose cell 0's `secret` slot carries an SGM clearance mandate (sensitivity
`mid`). All four writing actors hold AUTHORITY over cell 0 (actor 0 by ownership; actors 1, 2, 9 by
a `node 0` cap) so the AUTHORITY gate passes for all of them — leaving the CLEARANCE caveat as the
sole discriminator. That is the point: the verified executor admits the write iff the actor's
clearance dominates the slot's sensitivity, regardless of whether they could otherwise touch the
cell. (Cells 0 and 1 only; total balance = 100 + 5 = 105.) -/

under-cleared actor's clearance write FAILS CLOSED via `stateStepGuarded_caveat_violation_fails` — the
caveat gate rejected it, so the live `setFieldA` leg does not commit. -/

  stateStepGuarded_caveat_violation_fails ssSGM "secret" 2 0 42 (by decide)

/-- **Non-vacuity: the ADMITTED clearance write was genuinely caveat-clean** (`stateStepGuarded_admits`
witnesses `caveatsAdmit` held — the clearance mandate was satisfied, not bypassed). -/
