# Dregg2.Exec.FullForest — the TREE-SHAPED `FullActionA` call-FOREST (the wholesale-swap KEYSTONE).

`Exec/TurnForest.lean` closed the nested call-FOREST over the NARROW `TurnExecutor.Action` (balance/
effect only): `execForest` = the recursive all-or-nothing tree executor, proved EQUAL to `execTurn`
over the pre-order flattening (`execForest_eq_execTurn`), with Granovetter non-amplification across
the forest (`execForest_no_amplify`) and the four `StepInv` conjuncts (`execForest_attests`).
`Exec/TurnExecutorFull.lean` then WIDENED the LINEAR executor to the FULL dregg1 op-set, PER-ASSET:
`FullActionA = balanceA | delegate | revoke | mintA | burnA`, one `execFullA` / `execFullTurnA`, with
the per-asset CONSERVATION VECTOR (`execFullTurnA_ledger_per_asset` / `_conserves_per_asset`) — the
FILL-1 ledger that forbids cross-asset laundering (a SCALAR aggregate cannot state it).

This module is the JOIN: the TREE pattern of `TurnForest`, WIDENED to `FullActionA`, PER-ASSET. It is
the executable artifact the wholesale swap exports — the tree-shaped call-forest over the full
op-set, with conservation tracked as the per-asset vector end-to-end. We mirror `TurnForest`'s blessed
shape EXACTLY (OPTION B — proved flat lowering): a `FullForestA` tree, an operational tree executor
`execFullForestA`, a pre-order lowering `lowerForestA`, and the BRIDGE `execFullForestA_eq_execFullTurnA`
that lifts EVERY `execFullTurnA` theorem to the tree. The conservation corollaries INHERIT the FILL-1
per-asset vector (NOT a blanket `recTotal`-fixed — false for mint/burn trees: a forest that mints or
burns legitimately moves the supply, disclosed).

PER-ASSET IS THE SOLE CANONICAL CARRIER. There is deliberately NO scalar mirror structure — that is
the regression `FILL 1` guards against (a scalar would let a mint of asset B net against a burn of
asset A and pass off as "conserved"). Every conservation statement here is the `∀ b`/per-asset
`recTotalAsset … b` family.

We prove, over the whole tree (all-or-nothing):

  * **`execFullForestA_eq_execFullTurnA`** — the tree transaction IS `execFullTurnA` over the
    pre-order flattening (the bridge lifting every per-asset linear theorem; rests on
    `execFullTurnA_append`);
  * **`execFullForestA_ledger_per_asset` / `_conserves_per_asset`** — the per-asset CONSERVATION
    VECTOR end-to-end across the whole tree (`recTotalAsset … b` moves by exactly the net per-asset
    ledger delta of the lowered turn, for EVERY asset `b`); the conserving corollary when the net is
    `0` in asset `b`. INHERITS the FILL-1 vector — NEVER a blanket scalar-fixed;
  * **`execFullForestA_no_amplify`** — every delegation edge of the forest is non-amplifying
    (`Caps.derive_no_amplify`): Granovetter across the whole tree, no child gains authority the parent
    lacked (the SAME law + edge data as `TurnForest.execForest_no_amplify`);
  * **`execFullForestA_each_attests`** — every tree node attests its `fullActionInvA` (the per-asset
    ledger vector ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance ∧ the kind obligation), via membership-lift through the
    bridge into `execFullTurnA_each_attests`;
  * **`execFullForestA_unauthorized_fails`** — root fail-closed (an unauthorized root rejects the
    whole forest).

FIDELITY OVERLAY (§9). The executor here is the `DelegationMode::None` default: every child's
`FullActionA` target is the same cell as the parent's (`sameTargetForest`, a STRUCTURAL predicate). A
CROSS-TARGET subtree (a child acting on a DIFFERENT cell) is the cross-cell axis — ROUTED to
`Exec/CrossCellForest.lean` (`crossForest_conserves`, the N-ary cross-cell Σ=0 binding-carried CG-5),
NOT re-proven and NOT baked into this executor. Bearer-bypass (a cap presented WITHOUT a delegation
edge) is scoped OUT for v1 — every node here runs under its own `execFullA` authority gate.

Delegated caps NEVER amplify (`derive_no_amplify`, reused). Conservation is
PER-ASSET (`execFullTurnA_ledger_per_asset`, reused).
Reuses `TurnExecutorFull`/`Caps`; edits none (the §MB additions to
`TurnExecutorFull` are its own region).

/-! ## §1 — The `FullForestA`: a TREE of full-op-set, per-asset `FullActionA`s.

A node carries its own `FullActionA` (run via `execFullA`) and, per child, the DELEGATION EDGE — the
parent's `parentCap`, the `keep` rights it is attenuated to (`Caps.derive`), and the `holder` label
the derived cap is granted to — and the child subtree itself. The `FullForestA` analog of
`TurnForest`, widened to the full per-asset op-set.

The delegation edge data lives in the child wrapper (`FullChildA`) so the no-amplification law is a
STRUCTURAL fact about the forest data: every `FullChildA` edge confers ≤ its parent's `parentCap`.

There is deliberately NO scalar mirror — per-asset is the sole canonical carrier (to foreclose the
FILL-1 scalar-laundering regression). -/

/-! ## §1.5 — `capTarget`: the cell a `parentCap` confers an edge TO (the delegation's target).

A delegation edge hands the child an ATTENUATED copy of `parentCap`. The `recKDelegateAtten` gate
(reused below) GATES on the DELEGATOR holding a cap conferring an edge to the parentCap's
TARGET — so we must read that target off `parentCap`. A `node t`/`endpoint t _` cap names target `t`;
a `null` cap names NO object (it confers `[]`), so it has no delegation target — the faithful handoff
of a null cap installs NOTHING (the child receives no new authority; `recKDelegateAtten` is not even
reachable). This `Option` is the discriminant the executor and lowering BOTH read. -/

/-- **`capTarget cap`** — the target cell a cap confers an edge to (`node t`/`endpoint t _ ⇒ some t`;
`null ⇒ none`, a cap that names no object). The delegation gate (`recKDelegateAtten`) checks the
delegator holds a cap to THIS target before handing the child the attenuated copy. -/

/-! ## §2 — `execFullForestA`: run the tree as an ALL-OR-NOTHING transaction (the executable artifact).

Each node runs its own `FullActionA` via `execFullA` (the fail-closed per-kind gate, extending the
receipt chain, moving the per-asset ledger by exactly `ledgerDeltaAsset`). Then each child runs under
a REAL, EXECUTED delegation handoff: the edge `⟨holder, keep, parentCap, sub⟩` is routed through the
PROVED `recCDelegateAtten s delegator holder t keep` (the faithful `apply_introduce`) — where
`delegator` is the PARENT node's target (`targetOf a`, the authority being delegated) and `t :=
capTarget parentCap`. That step GATES on the delegator holding a cap to `t`
(`recKDelegateAtten_non_amplifying`: the granted cap's rights are `⊆` the held cap's) and INSTALLS the
attenuated cap into `holder`'s slot — balance-neutral (`recKDelegateAtten_frame`, edits only `caps`).
A FORGED/UNAUTHORIZED edge (the delegator holds NO cap to `t`) ⇒ `recCDelegateAtten = none` ⇒ the
WHOLE forest rejects (the non-amplification is now NON-vacuous ON EXECUTION). Only AFTER the handoff
commits does the child subtree run via `execFullForestA`. A `null` parentCap names no target
(`capTarget = none`) so it delegates NOTHING — the child runs under its own independent authority (a
null cap confers `[]`; there is no authority to hand over). Any `none` anywhere aborts the whole
forest (the journal/rollback discipline — no partial commit), exactly as `execFullTurnA`'s `Option`
fold. The recursion is structural over the tree (`execFullForestA`/`execFullChildrenA` mutual). -/

/-! ## §3 — The pre-order lowering: the forest's flattened action list (OPTION B carrier).

The forest's actions, in EXECUTION ORDER (pre-order: a node before its children, children
left-to-right). `execFullForestA` is exactly `execFullTurnA` over `lowerForestA` — so every
`execFullTurnA` theorem lifts to the forest by this flattening. We prove that equivalence

The tree transaction equals the linear per-asset transaction over its pre-ordered node-actions:

`execFullTurnA` theorem (`execFullTurnA_ledger_per_asset`, `execFullTurnA_each_attests`, …) to the
forest — the recursion threads the chained state in exactly the pre-order `Option`-fold
`execFullTurnA` performs. PROVED by mutual structural induction over the tree, mutually with the
child-list lowering `execFullChildrenA_eq_execFullTurnA`. Rests on `execFullTurnA_append`. -/

/-! ## §6 — `execFullForestA_no_amplify`: delegated caps NEVER amplify (Granovetter across the forest).

Each `FullChildA` edge `⟨holder, keep, parentCap, _⟩` delegates `attenuate keep parentCap` to
`holder` (the `Caps.derive` handoff). The cap-system no-amplification law `Caps.derive_no_amplify`
says the derived cap confers ≤ the parent's authority — so NO child gains authority the parent lacked.
We collect every edge of the tree and prove this holds of ALL of them: Granovetter (only connectivity
begets connectivity) across the whole forest. SAME law + edge data as
`TurnForest.execForest_no_amplify` — reused, never re-stubbed. A STRUCTURAL fact (holds of every
well-formed forest, committed or not). -/

/-- **`edge_no_amplify` (the per-edge Granovetter law).** A single delegation edge is
non-amplifying: the cap delegated to the child (`attenuate keep parentCap`) confers ≤ the parent's

`execFullForestA_no_amplify` above is STRUCTURAL (it bounds each edge's `attenuate keep parentCap` by
the DECLARED `parentCap`, true of any forest, committed or not). The de-vacuified law is about the
EXECUTED handoff: when the executor's per-edge step `recCDelegateAtten s delegator holder t keep`
COMMITS, the cap it actually INSTALLS into `holder`'s slot confers `List Auth` rights `⊆` the cap the
delegator GENUINELY HELD to `t` (`recKDelegateAtten_non_amplifying`, granted-vs-HELD — two different
caps, NOT a `()≤()` collapse). And a forged/unauthorized edge (the delegator holds no cap to `t`)
NEVER commits (`recCDelegateAtten = none` ⇒ whole-forest rollback). THIS is the soundness content the
old decorative executor lacked: the gate is exercised ON EXECUTION, referencing the COMMITTED kernel
caps. -/

/-! ## §9 — Fidelity overlay: `sameTargetForest` (the `DelegationMode::None` default) + cross-cell routing.

The executor here is the `DelegationMode::None` default: a child's `FullActionA` runs on the SAME
TARGET CELL as its parent. `targetOf` reads the cell a `FullActionA` acts on (the `src`/`cell` field);
`sameTargetForest` is the STRUCTURAL predicate that every child's target equals its parent's. This is
the INTRA-cell fidelity overlay — the forest's nodes all touch the one record cell's ledger, so the
per-asset conservation VECTOR (`execFullForestA_conserves_per_asset`) is DERIVED, not binding-carried,
exactly as `TurnForest`'s intra-cell conservation is derived.

A CROSS-TARGET subtree — a child whose target cell DIFFERS from its parent's — is the cross-cell axis.
It is ROUTED to `Exec/CrossCellForest.lean` (`crossForest_conserves`, the N-ary cross-cell Σ=0 binding-
carried CG-5; `crossForest_no_amplify`; `crossForest_attests`), where the whole-forest conservation is
the inviolable Σ=0 binding carried as a HYPOTHESIS (NOT derivable, because cross-cell halves need not
individually cancel). We deliberately do NOT bake a cross-target branch into `execFullForestA`, and we
do NOT re-prove the cross-cell axis here — the routing is the honest division of labor.

Bearer-bypass (a cap presented WITHOUT a delegation edge — `DelegationMode::Bearer`) is scoped OUT for
v1: every node here runs under its own `execFullA` authority gate, and delegation is the only authority
handoff modeled. -/

-- `targetOf` is defined in §1.5 (it is now load-bearing for the executor: it is the DELEGATOR of each
-- child edge — the authority handed downward). `sameTargetForest` reuses it as its discriminant.

mutual
/-- **`sameTargetForest`** — the STRUCTURAL `DelegationMode::None` fidelity predicate: every child's
`FullActionA` target equals the parent node's target (the intra-cell forest). A CROSS-TARGET subtree

/-! ## §9.CONFINE — AUTHORITY CONFINEMENT: the child USES the delegated cap (not just the handoff).

`execFullForestA_no_amplify` (§6) bounds the inserted HANDOFF (`attenuate keep parentCap ⊆ parentCap`),
and `recCDelegateAtten_executed_no_amplify` (§6.EXECUTED) bounds the cap INSTALLED into `holder`'s slot
(`granted ⊆ held`). But neither says the child SUBTREE actually CONFINES itself to that delegated cap:
the executor runs `sub` as an ordinary `execFullForestA` whose root action may target ANY cell. The
delegation grants authority over `t := capTarget parentCap` (the cell the parentCap confers an edge to);
a confined child is one whose root action ACTS ON that delegated cell `t` — i.e. it USES the delegated
authority rather than reaching for an unrelated one.

`confinedForest` is the STRUCTURAL precondition that binds this: every child's root action targets the
cell its edge delegated authority to (`targetOf sub.action = t`), recursively. `execFullChildrenA_confined_uses_delegated`
is the theorem that, COMBINED with the executed-handoff bound, makes the no-amplification law bound the
authority the child USES (its target = the delegated `t`, and the rights usable at `t` are `⊆` the
delegator's HELD rights), not merely the handoff.

THE NAMED RESIDUAL (the precise edge of what is and is NOT bounded here):
  * BOUNDED: the child's root action operates on the DELEGATED target cell `t`, under a cap whose
    rights at `t` are `⊆` the delegator's held rights (`recCDelegateAtten_executed_no_amplify`). The
    child cannot use the edge to reach an UNRELATED cell.
  * RESIDUAL #1 — per-FACET / per-effect use (does the child's effect stay within `keep`'s facets, and
    is its ACTOR exactly `holder`?) is the NODE-LEVEL gate's job: `execFullA`'s `authorizedB` /
    `stateAuthB` / `mintAuthorizedB` already fail-close a node whose actor lacks the cap-table rights
    for its effect on `t` (`execFullForestA_each_attests` carries the per-node obligation). The forest
    edge binds the TARGET; the node gate binds the FACET+actor. This is defense-in-depth, not a hole.
  * RESIDUAL #2 — `confinedForest` is a PRECONDITION (a property of the forest data the caller asserts),
    not yet a runtime check baked into `execFullForestA` (that would force a `capTarget`-vs-`targetOf`
    branch in the executor and is the cross-target routing's concern; a non-confined child is the
    cross-cell axis, routed to `Exec/CrossCellForest.lean`). We prove the confinement THEOREM under this
    precondition; making it an executor-enforced gate is the cross-target rotation. -/

mutual
/-- **`confinedForest`** — the AUTHORITY-CONFINEMENT predicate: every child's root action targets the
cell its delegation edge granted authority to (`targetOf sub.action = capTarget parentCap`, when the
edge delegates a real cap), recursively. A confined forest's children USE their delegated caps (act on
the delegated target), not arbitrary authority. A `null` parentCap (`capTarget = none`) delegates
nothing, so its child is unconstrained by THIS edge (it runs under its own independent authority). -/
def confinedForest : FullForestA → Prop

`t` (`targetOf sub.action = t`), AND each subtree is itself confined. -/

/-- **`execFullChildrenA_confined_uses_delegated` — the child USES the delegated authority.** For a

executed handoff COMMITS, the child's root action targets EXACTLY `t` (it acts on the delegated cell),
and the cap installed into `holder`'s slot confers rights `⊆` the delegator's HELD cap to `t`. So the
authority the child USES (its target cell + the rights available there) is bounded by what was actually
delegated — NOT merely the handoff. (`recCDelegateAtten_executed_no_amplify` supplies the rights bound;
`confinedForest` supplies the target bound — together they confine USED authority.) -/

authority-confined — its root edge delegates a cap to cell **1** (`capTarget (endpoint 1 …) = 1`) but
the child action `balanceA ⟨0,0,1,30⟩` TARGETS cell **0** (`src = 0 ≠ 1`). So the child uses the
delegated cap to reach a DIFFERENT cell than the cap was for — exactly the unconfined-authority shape
the predicate catches. (`goodFullForest` still COMMITS and is non-amplifying — confinement is an
ORTHOGONAL, stronger property that the §6 theorems did NOT establish.) -/

owns cell 1), grandchild transfer 0→1 of 5 (asset 0). The two delegation edges are EXECUTED: the first
GATES on cell 0 holding a cap to cell 1 (`endpoint 1 [r,w]`), the deeper one (delegator = cell 1, the
inner transfer's `src`) GATES on cell 1 holding a cap to cell 0 (`endpoint 0 [r,w]`). All transfers
conserve asset 0 (and trivially asset 1). -/

W1 kills the channel structurally: mint/burn are issuer-moves, so the per-asset delta family is
IDENTICALLY ZERO — no supply op exists to launder with. The tree below still REJECTS, now for an
even sharper reason: the child's `burnA 9 0 0 50` is a SELF-BURN of the issuer's own well

/-! The NO-AMPLIFY edge witness: a STRICT attenuation. `keep = [read]` ⊊ `parentCap = endpoint with

`()≤()` collapse). The genuine Granovetter inequality `granted ⊊ held`. -/

/-! ## §12 — OUTCOME.

The TREE-SHAPED `FullActionA` call-FOREST (the wholesale-swap KEYSTONE) is CLOSED, per-asset, fully
general:

  * `FullForestA`/`FullChildA` — a TREE of full-op-set, per-asset `FullActionA`s (NO scalar mirror —
    per-asset the sole canonical carrier), each child under a cap DERIVED (`Caps.derive`) from its
    parent's, run all-or-nothing;
  * `execFullForestA`/`execFullChildrenA` — the recursive transactional executor over the tree
    (arbitrary depth/branching — the EXECUTABLE artifact), proved EQUAL to `execFullTurnA` over the
    pre-order lowering (`execFullForestA_eq_execFullTurnA`, OPTION B) — the bridge that lifts every
    per-asset linear theorem (rests on `execFullTurnA_append`);
  * `execFullForestA_ledger_per_asset` / `_conserves_per_asset` — the per-asset CONSERVATION VECTOR
    end-to-end across the whole tree (INHERITS the FILL-1 vector; NOT a blanket scalar-fixed, which is
    false for mint/burn trees);
  * `execFullForestA_no_amplify` — EVERY delegation edge is non-amplifying (`derive_no_amplify`):
    Granovetter across the whole forest, the SAME law + edge data as `TurnForest.execForest_no_amplify`;
  * `execFullForestA_each_attests` (+ `_root_attests`) — every node attests its `fullActionInvA` (the
    per-asset ledger vector ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance ∧ kind obligation), via membership-lift through
    the bridge;
  * `execFullForestA_unauthorized_fails` — root fail-closed;
  * `sameTargetForest` — the `DelegationMode::None` fidelity overlay; cross-target subtrees ROUTED to
    `Exec/CrossCellForest.lean` (not re-proven, not baked in); Bearer-bypass scoped OUT for v1;
  * non-vacuous (`goodFullForest` 3-level mint+transfer+burn nets to 0 PER-ASSET ⇒ conserved;
    `deepFullForest` 3-level; `badChildFullForest`/`badRootFullForest` unauthorized mint ⇒ whole forest
    none; `launderFullForest` shows the per-asset delta is NONZERO in each asset where a scalar would
    hide it; the strict no-amplify edge witness drops `write`), axiom-clean.

-- ROUTED (the cross-cell axis, deliberately not duplicated here). A child whose target cell DIFFERS
--   from its parent's (a CROSS-TARGET subtree, `targetOf sub.action ≠ targetOf parent`) is the
--   cross-cell forest — `Exec/CrossCellForest.lean` (`crossForest_conserves`, the N-ary cross-cell
--   Σ=0 binding-carried CG-5; `crossForest_no_amplify`; `crossForest_attests`). This module is the
--   INTRA-cell (`sameTargetForest`, `DelegationMode::None`) default; the cross-cell axis is routed,
--   NOT re-proven and NOT baked into `execFullForestA`. Bearer-bypass (`DelegationMode::Bearer`) is
--   scoped OUT for v1 — a documented follow-on, not faked or assumed.
