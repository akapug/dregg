# Dregg2.Exec.NullifierCell — the nullifier set as an append-only cell, proved tier-1-safe.

The nullifier set is a **G-Set** (grow-only set): state = `Finset Nullifier`, join = `∪`,
admissibility invariant = "once spent, forever spent" (`s₀ ⊆ s`). Because this invariant is
upward-closed, it is `Confluence.IConfluent` — preserved under concurrent merge — hence
`Confluence.Tier1Eligible`: the nullifier cell needs NO consensus (causal-only, coordination-
free, partition-tolerant). Two replicas can accept disjoint spends offline and union their
spent-sets with zero coordination.

Contrast (`dregg2.md §2.3`): a `balance≥0` cell is linear but NOT I-confluent — two
concurrent debits each preserve the bound yet jointly overdraw. The discriminating witness is
`Confluence.cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`.

Reuses `Privacy.Nullifier` and `Confluence`'s `IConfluent`/`Tier1Eligible`/`MergeState`.

Crypto-soundness of `nullifierOf` (PRF/extractability) is a circuit obligation (`Privacy.lean`
§8 caveat), not touched here. This module is pure, decidable, computable Lean — no
`axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`.

/-! ## The cell — a G-Set of consumed nullifiers. -/

/-- **A `NullifierCell`** — the nullifier set as a cell. Its entire state is `spent`, the
`Finset` of consumed nullifiers (modelled as the live finite set, not a Merkle digest).
The transition rule is append-only: `spend` inserts, nothing ever removes. -/

def empty : Cell := { spent := ∅ }

/-- `isSpent c n` : is nullifier `n` already in the cell's spent set? Decidable and
computable — membership query against the live set-root. -/

  unfold isSpent; infer_instance

/-! ## The append-only transition: `spend` (anti-double-spend, fail-closed). -/

/-- **`spend c n`** — the cell's one transition rule. Insert nullifier `n` iff it is
NOT already present (anti-double-spend), returning the grown cell; otherwise fail
**closed** with `none`. This is INSERT-ONLY: there is no removal morphism, so the
spent set is grow-only (`Terminal`-linearity — once spent, forever spent). A
nullifier already in `spent` is rejected (the double-spend), realising the public
contention gate over the spent-note set. -/
def spend (c : Cell) (n : Nullifier) : Option Cell :=
  if n ∈ c.spent then
    none                                   -- already spent ⇒ fail-closed
  else
    some { spent := insert n c.spent }     -- fresh ⇒ admit and record

/-! ## `spend_no_double_spend` — the anti-double-spend law (both directions). -/

/-- **Anti-double-spend, half 1 — reuse is rejected (fail-closed).** A nullifier
already in `spent` cannot be spent again: `spend` returns `none`. This is the
double-spend gate; determinism of the (upstream) `nullifierOf` map is what makes a
re-spent *note* yield this *same* already-present tag (`Privacy.Nullifier`), but
the rejection itself is decidable set logic. -/

    (h : n ∈ c.spent) : spend c n = none := by
  unfold spend
  rw [if_pos h]

/-- **Anti-double-spend, half 2 — a fresh nullifier is admitted and lands in
`spent`.** Spending an `n` NOT already present succeeds, and the resulting cell
records exactly `insert n c.spent` — so `n` is now spent (and everything
previously spent still is: grow-only). -/

    spend c n = some { spent := insert n c.spent } := by
  unfold spend

/-- **`spend_no_double_spend` — the combined keystone of anti-double-spend.** In one
statement: a nullifier already in `spent` is rejected (`none`), AND a fresh one is
admitted with the result landing in `spent` (membership after the successful
spend). Fail-closed reuse + monotone growth, the two halves the spent set must
guarantee. -/
theorem spend_no_double_spend (c : Cell) (n : Nullifier) :

  exact Finset.mem_insert_self n c.spent

/-- **Insert-only / grow-only (`Terminal`-linearity).** A successful `spend` only
*adds*: every previously-spent nullifier is still spent afterward, and nothing is
removed. The spent set is monotone — the formal content of "append-only, `remove`
forbidden" (`02-spine-cell §1.4`). -/

/-! ## Tier-1 eligibility: the nullifier set is I-confluent.

Concurrent replicas merge their spent sets by `⊔` (= `∪`) — the G-Set CvRDT join. The
admissibility invariant `s₀ ⊆ s` is I-confluent: preserved under `∪`. That is exactly
`Confluence.Tier1Eligible`, so the nullifier cell may run at tier-1 (causal-only,
coordination-free, partition-tolerant) — it needs no consensus. -/

/-- The spent-set state — `Finset Nullifier` — is a `Confluence.MergeState`:
concurrent versions merge by `⊔` (= `∪`), the G-Set CvRDT join. This is the
join-semilattice the I-confluence judgement runs over. -/
instance : MergeState (Finset Nullifier) := { toSemilatticeSup := inferInstance }

/-- `⊔` on the spent-set state really is set union — the CvRDT join is `∪`. Pins the
abstract lattice join to the concrete G-Set merge so the I-confluence proof below
is over the genuine union, not an opaque `⊔`. -/
@[simp] theorem mergeState_sup_eq_union (a b : Finset Nullifier) :
    a ⊔ b = a ∪ b := rfl

/-- **The no-loss invariant is `IConfluent`.** The admissibility invariant `fun s => s₀ ⊆ s`
("once spent, forever spent: no consumed nullifier is ever dropped") is falsifiable
(witnessed by `nullifierSet_monotone_invariant_nontrivial`) and I-confluent:
`s₀ ⊆ x → s₀ ⊆ y → s₀ ⊆ x ∪ y` (upward-closed sets are union-stable). This is the exact
dual of why a `card ≤ 1` / `balance≥0` upper bound is NOT I-confluent: an upper bound is
broken by union, a lower bound is preserved by it. -/
theorem nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent (s₀ : Finset Nullifier) :
    IConfluent (S := Finset Nullifier) (fun s => s₀ ⊆ s) := by
  intro x y hx _hy
  -- `s₀ ⊆ x` and `x ⊆ x ∪ y = x ⊔ y` give `s₀ ⊆ x ⊔ y` by transitivity.
  rw [mergeState_sup_eq_union]
  exact hx.trans (Finset.subset_union_left)

/-- **The no-loss invariant genuinely discriminates (non-vacuity of `…_monotone_iconfluent`).**
For a non-empty baseline `{n}`, the no-loss invariant `fun s => {n} ⊆ s` is satisfied by
`{n}` itself yet FAILS for the empty set `∅` — so it is a real, falsifiable predicate,
not always-true. This is what makes `nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent` non-vacuous: it
asserts I-confluence of an invariant that actually rules states out. -/
theorem nullifierSet_monotone_invariant_nontrivial (n : Nullifier) :
    ({n} ⊆ ({n} : Finset Nullifier)) ∧ ¬ ({n} ⊆ (∅ : Finset Nullifier)) := by
  refine ⟨Finset.Subset.refl _, ?_⟩
  simp [Finset.subset_empty]

/-- **Tier-1 carrier theorem (revocation-set reuse hook, `Authority.Credential`).** The
`s₀ = ∅` instance of `nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent`: I-confluence of the trivial
carrier `fun _ => True`. The falsifiable safety content is `nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent`;
this is its degenerate structural instance, kept for the downstream consensus-free reuse. -/
theorem nullifierSet_iconfluent :
    IConfluent (S := Finset Nullifier) (fun _ => True) := by
  -- specialize the real theorem at the empty baseline, then discharge `∅ ⊆ s` (always true).
  have := nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent (∅ : Finset Nullifier)
  exact fun x y _ _ => trivial

/-- **A merge-explicit form of the keystone.** The union of two spent-sets is again
a valid spent-set whose membership is exactly the union of memberships — the
concrete CvRDT join law underlying `nullifierSet_iconfluent`. A nullifier is spent
in the merged cell iff it was spent in *either* replica: no spend is lost, none is
invented. (This is the "merge preserves the invariant" content, stated on the live
membership rather than the trivial carrier.) -/
theorem merge_preserves_membership (a b : Finset Nullifier) (n : Nullifier) :
    n ∈ (a ⊔ b) ↔ (n ∈ a ∨ n ∈ b) := by
  rw [mergeState_sup_eq_union]
  exact Finset.mem_union

/-- **The nullifier cell is `Tier1Eligible` for its genuine safety invariant.** I-confluence
of the no-loss invariant is exactly `Confluence.Tier1Eligible`: the nullifier cell runs at
tier-1 for the real, falsifiable "once spent, forever spent" property — replicas accept
spends offline and union without coordination, never losing a consumed nullifier. -/
theorem nullifierCell_monotone_tier1_eligible (s₀ : Finset Nullifier) :
    Tier1Eligible (S := Finset Nullifier) (fun s => s₀ ⊆ s) :=
  nullifierSet_monotone_iconfluent s₀

/-- **Tier-1 carrier theorem (revocation-set reuse hook, `Authority.Credential`).** The
`s₀ = ∅` instance of `nullifierCell_monotone_tier1_eligible` — tier-1 eligibility for the
trivial carrier. The falsifiable safety content is `nullifierCell_monotone_tier1_eligible`;
this is its degenerate structural instance, kept for downstream consensus-free reuse. -/
theorem nullifierCell_tier1_eligible :
    Tier1Eligible (S := Finset Nullifier) (fun _ => True) :=
  nullifierSet_iconfluent

/-- **Merging two cells** — the CvRDT join lifted to `NullifierCell`: take the union
of the two spent sets. By `nullifierCell_tier1_eligible` this merge needs no
consensus; by `merge_preserves_membership` it loses no spend. -/
def merge (c d : Cell) : Cell :=
  { spent := c.spent ∪ d.spent }

/-- Merging cells is exactly the join on their spent-set states — the cell-level
CvRDT merge is the state-level `⊔`. -/
theorem merge_spent (c d : Cell) :
    (merge c d).spent = c.spent ⊔ d.spent := rfl

/-! ## Contrast — why `balance≥0` is NOT tier-1-safe.

The nullifier set's invariant is a lower bound (grow-only), preserved by union. A
`balance≥0`-style invariant is an upper bound: two concurrent debits each preserve it,
yet their merge jointly overdraws. `Confluence.cardLeOne_not_iconfluent` is exactly this
shape — a `card ≤ 1` cap is broken by `{1} ⊔ {2} = {1,2}`. A cell carrying such an
invariant cannot run tier-1 and must escalate to consensus. -/

/-- **The contrast witness.** A `balance≥0`-shaped invariant (here the `card ≤ 1`
cap, `Confluence.cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`) is NOT I-confluent — so a cell carrying
it is NOT tier-1-eligible and must escalate to consensus. Re-exposed from
`Confluence` to stand beside `nullifierCell_tier1_eligible`: the nullifier set is
the clean win, the bounded cap is the one that needs coordination. -/

    ¬ Tier1Eligible (S := Finset ℕ) (fun s => s.card ≤ 1) :=
