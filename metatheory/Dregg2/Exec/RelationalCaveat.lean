# Dregg2.Exec.RelationalCaveat — the RECORD-LEVEL relational caveat, promoted to the LIVE surface.

**The W2 queue-unlock primitive, generalized (DREGG3 §8 axis 1).** The per-slot caveat surface
(`Exec.EffectsState.caveatsAdmit` / `RecordKernel.SlotCaveat.eval`) reads, for a write to ITS slot,
ONLY that slot's `(actor, old, new)` — it is structurally BLIND to every other slot's value. So no
existing `SlotCaveat` atom can express a CROSS-SLOT relation like a queue's capacity bound
`head − tail ≤ cap` or its no-underflow `tail ≤ head` (the falsification the queue probe isolated,
`Dregg2/Verify/QueueFactoryProbe.lean`, commit `c8f6b929c`, §0/§VERDICT).

This module promotes that probe's `RecordCaveat` from a PROBE-LOCAL model into a LIVE record-level
caveat surface that the guarded field write enforces on the WHOLE post-write record. The single
instance the storage families need is `FieldLteOther index other delta`:

  in the POST-write record, `record[index] ≤ record[other] + delta`.

  * `fieldLteOther head capacity tail` ≡ the CAPACITY bound `head − tail ≤ cap`.
  * `fieldLteOther tail head 0`        ≡ the NO-UNDERFLOW bound `tail ≤ head`.

ONE atom, BOTH cross-slot bounds. With it, the queue/inbox/pubsub families become cell-programs (the
6-verb family `QueueAllocate/Enqueue/Dequeue/Resize/AtomicTx/PipelineStep` is subsumed by the
factory + the writes + this caveat — QueueFactoryProbe §VERDICT).

## What this file delivers (both halves of the W2 promotion, Lean side)

  * `RelCaveat` — a record-level caveat KIND whose evaluator reads the WHOLE post-write `Value`
    record (so it can compare two slots), with `FieldLteOther` as the first instance.
  * `RelCaveat.eval` / `relCaveatsAdmit` — the record-level evaluator surface, FAIL-CLOSED.
  * `relStateStepGuarded` — the guarded field write EXTENDED by the record-level relational gate:
    it commits the SAME post-state as `EffectsState.stateStepGuarded` (per-slot caveats) ONLY when,
    in addition, EVERY record-level relational caveat holds on the post-write record.
  * §EXPRESSES — `fieldLteOther` expresses the capacity + underflow bounds (the resolution).
  * §FRAME — a relationally-guarded write PRESERVES the existing balance/authority/metadata
    keystones, INSTANTIATED from `EffectsState` via `stateStepGuarded_eq` (NOT re-proved). This is
    the "guaranteed-superset" property: the new gate can only ever TIGHTEN the existing write.
  * §SOUNDNESS — a write that BREAKS a relational caveat on the post-record FAILS CLOSED.

SUPERSET: existing per-slot caveats are UNCHANGED — `relStateStepGuarded` calls the SAME
`stateStepGuarded`, then ADDS the record-level gate. With an EMPTY relational-caveat list it is
DEFINITIONALLY the existing guarded write (`relStateStepGuarded_nil_eq`), so nothing downstream
regresses.

NEW file only. Does NOT edit `EffectsState`/`RecordKernel`/`Dregg2.lean` or any Metatheory/*.
Reuses the proved `EffectsState` keystones + `RecordKernel.recKExecAsset_conserves_per_asset`;
defines the record-level caveat surface here as the live promotion. Every keystone
`#assert_axioms`-pinned to `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` — no sorry, no `:= True`.

/-! ## §1 — The RECORD-LEVEL relational caveat KIND (the live promotion).

Unlike `SlotCaveat`, whose `eval` reads ONE slot's `(actor, old, new)`, a `RelCaveat` evaluates
against the WHOLE post-write `Value` record — that is exactly what a cross-slot relation needs. The
`FieldLteOther` instance is the minimal atom the storage census forces. -/

/-- **`RelCaveat` — a caveat evaluated against the WHOLE post-write record.** The per-slot
`SlotCaveat` reads only its slot's `(old, new)`; a cross-slot relation needs the full record. The
member the queue/inbox/pubsub families need is `fieldLteOther`. -/
inductive RelCaveat where
  /-- **`fieldLteOther index other delta`** — in the POST-write record,
  `record[index] ≤ record[other] + delta`. `fieldLteOther head cap tail` ≡ `head − tail ≤ cap`
  (capacity); `fieldLteOther tail head 0` ≡ `tail ≤ head` (no-underflow). ONE atom, BOTH bounds. -/
  | fieldLteOther (index other : FieldName) (delta : Int)
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- **`RelCaveat.eval cav rec`** — does the WHOLE post-write record `rec` satisfy the cross-slot
caveat? Reads `index`/`other` as scalars (absent ⇒ `0`, dregg1's `FIELD_ZERO` default), checks
`rec[index] ≤ rec[other] + delta`. Decidable, computable, FAIL-CLOSED. The record-level evaluator the
executor calls AFTER a write — the surface the per-slot `SlotCaveat.eval` cannot be. -/
def RelCaveat.eval : RelCaveat → Value → Bool
  | .fieldLteOther index other delta, rec =>
      decide (fieldOf index rec ≤ fieldOf other rec + delta)

/-- **`relCaveatsAdmit recCavs rec`** — do ALL record-level relational caveats admit the post-write
record `rec`? FAIL-CLOSED: a single violated relation rejects the write. The record-level analog of
`EffectsState.caveatsAdmit` (which filters per-slot caveats); here each caveat reads the whole
record, so there is no per-slot filter. -/
def relCaveatsAdmit (recCavs : List RelCaveat) (rec : Value) : Bool :=
  recCavs.all (fun cav => cav.eval rec)

/-! ## §2 — The RELATIONALLY-GUARDED field write (the live surface, superset of `stateStepGuarded`).

`relStateStepGuarded` runs the EXISTING per-slot guarded write `stateStepGuarded` first (so all
per-slot caveats + authority + lifecycle gates fire UNCHANGED), then ADDS the record-level relational
gate on the post-write record of the target cell. It commits EXACTLY `stateStepGuarded`'s post-state
when the relational caveats also hold — otherwise FAILS CLOSED. -/

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n` — the record-level-guarded field write
(computable).** First the per-slot guarded write (`stateStepGuarded`: authority + lifecycle +
per-slot caveats), then the record-level relational gate `relCaveatsAdmit recCavs` on the post-write
record of `target`. Commits `stateStepGuarded`'s post-state iff BOTH gates pass. Fail-closed on
either. The executable shadow of dregg1's record-level `RecordProgram::evaluate` arm that reads the
whole post-state (`cell/src/program.rs` `FieldLteField`/`AffineLe`). -/

  match stateStepGuarded s f actor target n with
  | some s' => if relCaveatsAdmit recCavs (s'.kernel.cell target) = true then some s' else none
  | none    => none

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_eq`.** A committed relationally-guarded write is EXACTLY the
underlying per-slot `stateStepGuarded` write (the relational gate only RESTRICTS the domain — it
never changes the post-state). The bridge that lifts EVERY existing keystone to the relational write
verbatim. -/

        exact h
      · rw [if_neg hrel] at h; exact absurd h (by simp)

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_admits`.** A committed relationally-guarded write means every
record-level relational caveat ADMITTED the post-write record. The witness that the published
cross-slot invariants were enforced BY THE WRITE. -/
theorem relStateStepGuarded_admits {s s' : RecChainedState} {recCavs : List RelCaveat} {f : FieldName}

      · rw [if_neg hrel] at h; exact absurd h (by simp)

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_nil_eq` — SUPERSET.** With an EMPTY relational-caveat list the
relationally-guarded write is DEFINITIONALLY the existing per-slot `stateStepGuarded` write: the
record-level gate is vacuously satisfied (`List.all [] = true`). So the existing surface is recovered
exactly — the promotion is a strict superset, nothing downstream regresses. -/
theorem relStateStepGuarded_nil_eq (s : RecChainedState) (f : FieldName) (actor target : CellId)
    (n : Int) : relStateStepGuarded s [] f actor target n = stateStepGuarded s f actor target n := by
  unfold relStateStepGuarded relCaveatsAdmit
  cases stateStepGuarded s f actor target n with
  | none => rfl
  | some s' => simp

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_per_slot_fails` — SUPERSET, the per-slot half.** If the
underlying per-slot guarded write fails (authority / lifecycle / per-slot caveat rejected), the
relationally-guarded write ALSO fails — the relational gate can only TIGHTEN, never loosen. -/
theorem relStateStepGuarded_per_slot_fails (s : RecChainedState) (recCavs : List RelCaveat)
    (f : FieldName) (actor target : CellId) (n : Int)
    (h : stateStepGuarded s f actor target n = none) :
    relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n = none := by
  unfold relStateStepGuarded; rw [h]

/-! ## §3 — §FRAME: the relationally-guarded write PRESERVES the existing keystones (INSTANTIATED).

A committed `relStateStepGuarded` IS a committed `stateStepGuarded` (`relStateStepGuarded_eq`), so it
inherits the existing balance/authority/metadata keystones VERBATIM — we INSTANTIATE the proved
`EffectsState` lemmas, we do NOT re-prove them. This is the guarantee that the new cross-slot gate
preserves conservation + the authority frame. -/

/-- **`rel_state_conserves` — BALANCE UNCHANGED (instantiated).** A committed
relationally-guarded write (of a non-`balance` field) preserves the total balance — the record-level
relational gate is balance-neutral (it only DECIDES; it never moves value). Lifted from
`guarded_state_conserves` through `relStateStepGuarded_eq`. -/
theorem rel_state_conserves {s s' : RecChainedState} {recCavs : List RelCaveat} {f : FieldName}
    {actor target : CellId} {n : Int} (hf : f ≠ balanceField)
    (h : relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n = some s') :
    recTotal s'.kernel = recTotal s.kernel :=
  guarded_state_conserves hf (relStateStepGuarded_eq h)

/-- **`rel_state_authGraph_unchanged` (instantiated).** A committed relationally-guarded
write leaves the authority graph unchanged — a cross-slot relational caveat gates WRITES, never
connectivity. Lifted from `guarded_state_authGraph_unchanged`. -/
theorem rel_state_authGraph_unchanged {s s' : RecChainedState} {recCavs : List RelCaveat}
    {f : FieldName} {actor target : CellId} {n : Int}
    (h : relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n = some s') :
    execGraph s'.kernel.caps = execGraph s.kernel.caps :=
  guarded_state_authGraph_unchanged (relStateStepGuarded_eq h)

/-- **`rel_state_authorized` (instantiated).** A committed relationally-guarded write
implies the actor held authority over the target — the authority gate still fires under the
relational gate. Lifted from `guarded_state_authorized`. -/
theorem rel_state_authorized {s s' : RecChainedState} {recCavs : List RelCaveat} {f : FieldName}
    {actor target : CellId} {n : Int}
    (h : relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n = some s') :
    stateAuthB s.kernel.caps actor target = true :=
  guarded_state_authorized (relStateStepGuarded_eq h)

/-- **`rel_state_field_written` (instantiated).** After a committed relationally-guarded
write, the target's slot reads back exactly the written value — the metadata move is intact and the
record-level caveats held on this post-record (`relStateStepGuarded_admits`). Lifted from
`guarded_state_field_written`. -/
theorem rel_state_field_written {s s' : RecChainedState} {recCavs : List RelCaveat} {f : FieldName}
    {actor target : CellId} {n : Int}

    fieldOf f (s'.kernel.cell target) = n :=
  guarded_state_field_written (relStateStepGuarded_eq h)

/-! ## §4 — §EXPRESSES: `fieldLteOther` expresses the CAPACITY + UNDERFLOW bounds (the resolution).

We tie the live atom's `eval` to the semantic cross-slot predicates over a queue cell's record:
`fieldLteOther head cap tail` is EXACTLY `head − tail ≤ cap`, and `fieldLteOther tail head 0` is
EXACTLY `tail ≤ head`. So the live record-level atom captures both cross-slot bounds the per-slot
vocabulary cannot. (Field names are parameters — the queue probe pins the concrete `"queue.*"`
layout; here we state it generically for any three field names.) -/

/-- The occupancy bound on a record: `record[head] − record[tail] ≤ record[cap]`. -/
def capacityOk (rec : Value) (head tail cap : FieldName) : Prop :=
  fieldOf head rec - fieldOf tail rec ≤ fieldOf cap rec

/-- The no-underflow bound on a record: `record[tail] ≤ record[head]`. -/
def noUnderflow (rec : Value) (head tail : FieldName) : Prop :=
  fieldOf tail rec ≤ fieldOf head rec

/-- **`fieldLteOther_expresses_capacity`.** The atom `fieldLteOther head cap (record[tail])`
evaluates true on the record IFF the capacity bound holds. (The `delta` carries the second cross-slot
term `tail`, since `RelCaveat.eval` reads the named `index`/`other` slots plus a scalar `delta`.) -/
theorem fieldLteOther_expresses_capacity (rec : Value) (head tail cap : FieldName) :
    (RelCaveat.fieldLteOther head cap (fieldOf tail rec)).eval rec = true
      ↔ capacityOk rec head tail cap := by
  unfold RelCaveat.eval capacityOk
  rw [decide_eq_true_iff]; omega

/-- **`fieldLteOther_expresses_underflow`.** The atom `fieldLteOther tail head 0` evaluates
true IFF the no-underflow bound `tail ≤ head` holds. -/
theorem fieldLteOther_expresses_underflow (rec : Value) (head tail : FieldName) :
    (RelCaveat.fieldLteOther tail head 0).eval rec = true ↔ noUnderflow rec head tail := by
  unfold RelCaveat.eval noUnderflow
  rw [decide_eq_true_iff]; omega

/-! ## §5 — §SOUNDNESS: a write that BREAKS a relational caveat on the post-record FAILS CLOSED.

The teeth of the promotion: if the post-write record VIOLATES any record-level relational caveat,
the relationally-guarded write does NOT commit — even when authority, lifecycle, and all per-slot
caveats pass. This is what makes a queue's capacity/underflow bound REAL in-executor. -/

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_rel_violation_fails` (FAIL-CLOSED).** If the post-write record of
`target` (the record `stateStepGuarded` would commit) VIOLATES the record-level relational caveats
(`relCaveatsAdmit = false`), the relationally-guarded write does NOT commit. The executor-level
teeth: a write that would push occupancy over capacity, or tail past head, is REJECTED. -/

    relStateStepGuarded s recCavs f actor target n = none := by
  unfold relStateStepGuarded; rw [hcommit]; simp only; rw [if_neg (by rw [hviol]; simp)]

/-- **`relStateStepGuarded_capacity_enforced` — the capacity bound is enforced.** A
committed relationally-guarded write whose relational caveat list carries the capacity atom
`fieldLteOther head cap (post[tail])` lands in a post-record that RESPECTS `head − tail ≤ cap`. So the
cross-slot capacity bound is an in-executor INVARIANT of any committed write under this caveat —
exactly the queue no-overflow keystone, now at the live guarded surface. -/
