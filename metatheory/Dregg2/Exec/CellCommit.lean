# Dregg2.Exec.CellCommit — the COMMITMENT-PERSISTENCE crown: a published note commitment is never retracted.

`Exec/CellReal.lean` crowned the SHIPPED per-asset executor `execFullForestA` (the 46-effect, auth-gated
tree) with the coinductive **living cell** `livingCellA`, and `Exec/CellCarry.lean` distilled the
PARAMETRIC crown `livingCellA_carries`: ANY *state* predicate `Good` preserved by ONE living-cell step
holds along the ENTIRE unbounded adversarial trajectory `trajA`, under EVERY schedule. Conservation
(`livingCellA_obs_invariant'`) and the append-only audit log (`livingCellA_logMono`) are its first two
instances. This module adds the third headline of the **private-note layer**:

> **The note-commitment set is GROW-ONLY, FOREVER.** A commitment that has ever been published
> (`com0 ⊆ s.kernel.commitments`) is contained in `commitments` at EVERY index of the unbounded
> adversarial trajectory: it is never retracted, dropped, or rewritten. This is the **anti-equivocation /
> auditability** invariant of the off-ledger commitment tree — the grow-only DUAL of the nullifier set's
> no-double-spend (`META-FILL C`, closing `#121`) — now COINDUCTIVE on the real executor.

The proof is the same parametric shape as `livingCellA_logMono`, with the load-bearing per-step content
being a **registry frame lemma**: across ONE real `execFullA` step, `s.kernel.commitments` is *grown-only*
— `noteCreate` conses a fresh commitment onto it (`noteCreateCommitment`), and EVERY OTHER effect frames
it UNCHANGED (each kernel mutator is a `{ k with <non-commitments fields> := … }` structure update). So
`s.kernel.commitments ⊆ s'.kernel.commitments` for a committed `execFullA`, lifted to the forest and then
carried forever by `livingCellA_carries`.

Together with the nullifier-persistence crown this is the audit/anti-double-spend pair of the private-note
layer: the spent-set never loses a nullifier (no double-spend), the commitment-set never loses a
commitment (no equivocation) — both as `∀ n, Good (trajA …)` temporal νF invariants on the real machine.

Three theorems, ascending:
* **`execFullA_commitments_grow`** — the per-step registry frame: a committed `execFullA` step only GROWS
  `commitments` (`s.kernel.commitments ⊆ s'.kernel.commitments`), by case analysis on the 46-effect kind
  (noteCreate conses; all others frame). This is the executor-level content the crown stands on.
* **`execFullForestA_commitments_grow`** — the forest/turn lift: a committed full-FOREST only grows
  `commitments`, by induction on the lowered action list through the pre-order bridge.
* **`livingCellA_commitments_persist`** — THE CROWN: `com0 ⊆ s.kernel.commitments → ∀ n, com0 ⊆
  (trajA s sched n).kernel.commitments`. The grow-only set carried along the whole unbounded trajectory by
  `livingCellA_carries` with `Good := (com0 ⊆ ·.kernel.commitments)` — a genuinely NON-conservation safety,
  discharged from the registry frame on a commit + the stay-put self-loop on a reject.

/-! ## Step 0 — per-mutator COMMITMENTS frames: each kernel mutator leaves `commitments` UNCHANGED.

Every `execFullA` arm's kernel mutator is a `{ k with <fields> := … }` structure update whose `<fields>`
NEVER includes `commitments` — except `noteCreateCommitment`, which conses onto it. We pin the "unchanged"
half here as tiny per-mutator frames (each: unfold, split the admissibility gate, `subst`, `rfl`), so the
master step lemma is a thin dispatch rather than 40 inline gate-peels. The `none` (rejected) branch is
discharged by the master lemma; these speak only to a committed `some k'`. -/

/-! ## Step 3 — THE CROWN: a published commitment persists along the whole unbounded trajectory. -/

/-- **`livingCellA_commitments_persist` (PROVED) — THE COMMITMENT-PERSISTENCE CROWN.** Fix any baseline set
`com0` of published note commitments contained in the initial state's commitment set. Then `com0` is
contained in `commitments` at EVERY index of the unbounded adversarial trajectory `trajA s sched`, under
EVERY schedule: a published commitment is NEVER retracted, dropped, or rewritten. This is the
anti-equivocation / auditability invariant of the off-ledger commitment tree — the **grow-only DUAL** of the
nullifier set's no-double-spend (`META-FILL C`), now COINDUCTIVE on the SHIPPED executor.

It is carried by `livingCellA_carries` with `Good := (com0 ⊆ ·.kernel.commitments)`, a genuinely
NON-conservation safety. Its one-step obligation is discharged from the registry frame on a COMMIT
(`execFullForestA_commitments_grow` grows the set, chained by `List.Subset.trans`) and the **stay-put
self-loop** on a REJECT (`cellNextA` leaves the state — and thus `commitments` — UNCHANGED). With
`livingCellA_logMono` (audit-log append-only) this completes the audit/anti-double-spend pair of the
private-note layer as temporal νF invariants on the real machine. -/

/-! ## It runs (`#eval`) — a real `noteCreate` GROWS the commitment set (non-vacuity).

The persistence invariant would be vacuous if no turn ever grew `commitments`. A `noteCreateA cm`
forest commits and conses `cm` onto the set: the length goes `0 → 1` and `cm` is present afterward. So
`livingCellA_commitments_persist` bounds a strictly-growing quantity (a baseline already-present
commitment stays present even as new ones are added), and the crown is exercised by a property that
genuinely moves. -/

/-- A real single-`noteCreateA` forest: actor 9 publishes commitment `42`. It commits (a fresh
commitment cannot conflict) and grows `commitments` by one. -/
def noteCreateFA : FullForestA := ⟨.noteCreateA 42 9, []⟩

#guard ((execFullForestA fma0 noteCreateFA).map (fun s' => s'.kernel.commitments)) == some [42]  --  some [42] (grew from [])
#guard (fma0.kernel.commitments.length) == 0  --  0   (BEFORE — strictly less)
#guard ((execFullForestA fma0 noteCreateFA).map (fun s' => decide (42 ∈ s'.kernel.commitments))) == some true  --  some true
-- The carried predicate at a published baseline `[42]` holds AFTER the create (and would FAIL on `∅`-state):
#guard ((execFullForestA fma0 noteCreateFA).map (fun s' => decide (([42] : List Nat) ⊆ s'.kernel.commitments))) == some true  --  some true
