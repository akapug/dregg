# Dregg2.Exec.RecordKernel — the kernel laws over a CONTENT-ADDRESSED record cell-state.

`Exec/Kernel.lean` is the verified *micro-core*: its `KernelState.bal : CellId → ℤ` is a single
scalar ledger, and `exec_conserves`/`exec_authorized`/`exec_unauthorized_fails` are PROVED over
that whole-state ℤ. But the concrete dregg2 cell is NOT a scalar — it is `Exec/Value.lean`'s
schema-keyed record `Value` (named fields, `flatten`/`width`/`conforms`, `flatten_width` PROVED).
The construction study's single-highest-leverage move (`docs/rebuild/PHASE-CONSTRUCTION.md §1`,
"The single highest-leverage next move") is to replace the toy scalar ledger with that
content-addressed record cell and re-prove the kernel laws over a NAMED FIELD (`balance`) rather
than the whole-state ℤ — aligning the conserved quantity with `Spec/Conservation`'s domain-typed
conservation (`conservedInDomain Domain.balance`).

This module does exactly that, as a SECOND, parallel kernel ALONGSIDE the scalar one (the
sanctioned fallback when a full in-place lift of `KernelState` ripples too far — here it ripples
across ~8 `Finset.sum`-heavy `Exec/*` files). The toy scalar kernel stays UNTOUCHED and green; we
add `RecordKernelState` + `recKExec` whose cell-state is a `Value` record, conserve the **`balance`
field**, and re-prove ALL THREE kernel laws + the four-conjunct `StepInv` over it. The conserved
quantity becomes a domain measure over a named field — the `Spec.conservedInDomain Domain.balance`
shape — so this is the concrete-instance seam between "verified micro-core" and "verified dregg".

`flatten_width` (from `Value.lean`) is the foundation lemma the *circuit* side rests on; the
*semantic* re-proof here rests on `Value.scalar "balance"` (the named-field read), reusing
`Exec/Kernel.lean`'s already-proved `sum_indicator` over the `balance`-field measure.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Imports `Exec.Program` (for `Value.scalar`/`Value.field`) and
`Exec.Kernel` (for `CellId`/`Turn`/`authorizedB`/`Caps` + the reused `sum_indicator`).

/-! ## The record cell-state and its `balance`-field measure. -/

/-- The canonical name of a cell's fungible balance field. The conserved quantity lives HERE —
not in the whole-state ℤ, but in this NAMED field of the content-addressed record. -/
def balanceField : FieldName := "balance"

/-- **An asset identity.** A dregg cell holds MANY assets, and conservation must be **per-asset**,
never one aggregate scalar (`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`; `dregg2 §2.1`). A turn that moves
5 of asset 0 must leave the supply of asset 1 *literally untouched* — folding all assets into one
sum would let a cell silently swap one asset for another while the aggregate stays put. The
conserved quantity is therefore a *family* indexed by `AssetId` (see `§MULTI-ASSET` below). -/
abbrev AssetId : Type := Nat

/-- **`balOf v`** — read a cell record's `balance` field as an `Int`, defaulting an
absent/ill-typed field to `0` (fail-soft on the *measure*: a malformed record contributes `0` to
the total, never crashes the sum — the data-tier shadow of `Value.flatten`'s zero-default). This
is the named-field measure that replaces `KernelState.bal`'s whole-state scalar. -/
def balOf (v : Value) : Int := (v.scalar balanceField).getD 0

/-! ### The OFF-LEDGER holding-store: the escrow side-table (dregg1's `self.escrows`).

dregg1's `apply_create_escrow` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:1674`) does NOT do a balance-conserving
two-cell transfer. It does a SINGLE-cell debit (`set_balance(creator − amount)`, :1766) and inserts
an `EscrowRecord` into an **off-ledger side-table** `self.escrows` (:1770), keyed by `escrow_id`,
carrying `{creator, recipient, amount, resolved}`. `apply_release_escrow` (:1959) credits the
recipient single-handedly and marks the record `resolved`; `apply_refund_escrow` (:2030) credits the
creator single-handedly and marks resolved. So per-effect Σδ ≠ 0 on the cell ledger — conservation
holds only ACROSS the create+release/refund PAIR, with the side-table accounting for the in-flight
amount. We model that side-table faithfully here. -/

/-- **`EscrowRecord`** — one entry of dregg1's off-ledger `escrows` side-table (`apply.rs:1773`),
keyed by `id`, carrying the locked `amount`, the `creator` (refund target) and `recipient` (release
target), and the `resolved` flag (set true once released/refunded). An UNRESOLVED record holds
`amount` of value OUT of the cell ledger — that is the holding-store value the pair conserves. -/
structure EscrowRecord where
  /-- the escrow id (dregg1's `[u8;32]` escrow_id, modelled as a `Nat` key). -/
  id        : Nat
  /-- the creator cell whose balance was debited at create (the refund target). -/
  creator   : CellId
  /-- the recipient cell credited on release. -/
  recipient : CellId
  /-- the locked amount held off-ledger while unresolved. -/
  amount    : ℤ
  /-- false until released/refunded; an unresolved record holds `amount` off-ledger. -/
  resolved  : Bool
  /-- **The asset class of the locked value** (`META-FILL C`). dregg cells hold MANY assets, so an
  escrow lock parks `amount` of a SPECIFIC asset — and the combined per-asset measure must move at
  THAT asset only (`recTotalAssetWithEscrow r.asset`), every other asset literally untouched. Added
  ADDITIVELY (`:= 0`) so every existing 5-field `EscrowRecord` literal stays compiling (the default
  fills the 6th); the Wave-4 non-vacuity guard `#eval` LOCKS at a NON-ZERO asset to prove the default
  does NOT collapse to a single-asset shadow. -/
  asset     : AssetId := 0
  /-- **The BRIDGE tag** (Wave-5 `PHASE-BRIDGE`). A cross-chain bridge lock shares the SAME off-ledger
  holding-store as escrow — dregg1's `pending_bridges` is the bridge-shaped twin of `escrows`
  (`cell/src/note_bridge.rs`: a `PendingBridge` parks `value`/`asset_type` while `Locked`, AWAITING the
  other-chain confirmation). We reuse the escrow store with THIS additive tag (`:= false`, so every
  existing 6-field `EscrowRecord` literal stays compiling — the default fills the 7th) rather than a
  parallel side-table (least new machinery). The tag separates the two RESOLUTION semantics: an escrow
  release/refund SETTLES back onto the ledger (combined CONSERVED), whereas a bridge FINALIZE BURNS the
  locked value — it genuinely LEFT for the other chain, a disclosed outflow, so the COMBINED measure
  DROPS by the bridged amount (modelled honestly as a no-credit resolve). A bridge CANCEL
  (timeout/failure) refunds the originator (combined conserved, like escrow refund). -/
  bridge    : Bool := false

/-! ### The QUEUE side-table: a REAL ring-buffer FIFO automaton (dregg1's `MerkleQueue` / `CapInbox`).

dregg1's queue (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:3310 apply_queue_enqueue` / `:3420 apply_queue_dequeue`;
the data-structure substrate `storage/src/queue.rs:16 MerkleQueue`) is a FIFO buffer: enqueue APPENDS a
message hash to the tail and REJECTS fail-closed when `current_len >= capacity` (`apply.rs:3348`);
dequeue REMOVES-FROM-FRONT in FIFO order and REJECTS fail-closed when `current_len == 0`
(`apply.rs:3444`). dregg1's *cell-field* encoding stores only a head pointer + a tail pointer (two
`[u8;32]` slots), and EXPLICITLY DOCUMENTS a FIFO-advancement GAP — "the head cannot be advanced to the
next message hash without out-of-band knowledge of the message sequence … head lags by one until the
queue drains" (`apply.rs:3466-3481`). The `MerkleQueue` substrate (`queue.rs:16`) carries the FULL
ordered `Vec<QueueEntry>` + a `head: usize`, which IS the real FIFO, but its `verify_dequeue_proof` is
flagged a non-real prototype in the Rust itself (`queue.rs:416-426`). We model the REAL mechanism that
substrate intends — the de-THIN requirement — by carrying the FULL ordered `buffer : List Nat` of
message hashes (front = head = next-to-dequeue, back = tail = most-recently-enqueued). A `List` is a
ring-buffer up to representation; its head/tail give us exactly the FIFO order to PROVE (no advancement
gap, no two-pointer approximation). The queue holds MESSAGES (content hashes / capability invocations,
`CapInbox`), NOT balance — so it is balance-NEUTRAL (`recTotalAssetWithEscrow` UNCHANGED ∀ asset). -/

/-- **`QueueRecord`** — one entry of the queue side-table, keyed by `id` (dregg1's queue cell id,
modelled as a `Nat` key), carrying the queue `owner` (only the owner may dequeue — `apply.rs:3433`), the
`capacity` (the max occupancy — `apply.rs:3324`), and the REAL `buffer : List Nat` of message hashes in
FIFO order (front = head = next-to-dequeue). The occupancy is `buffer.length`; the capacity bound is
`buffer.length ≤ capacity`. dregg1's anti-spam `deposit` lives on the cell ledger (the `EffectsPaired`
deposit flow) — orthogonal to the ORDER mechanism modelled here. -/
structure QueueRecord where
  /-- the queue id (dregg1's queue cell `CellId`, modelled as a `Nat` key). -/
  id       : Nat
  /-- the queue owner — only the owner may dequeue (`apply.rs:3433`). -/
  owner    : CellId
  /-- the queue capacity — enqueue rejects fail-closed when occupancy reaches it (`apply.rs:3348`). -/
  capacity : Nat
  /-- **The REAL FIFO buffer**: the ordered list of message hashes, front = head = next-to-dequeue, back
  = tail = most-recently-enqueued. Enqueue APPENDS to the back; dequeue REMOVES the front. The occupancy
  is `buffer.length`. This is the de-THIN content — a flag/no-op model would have NO order and NO bound. -/
  buffer   : List Nat := []
deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **Enqueue into the buffer (the FIFO APPEND).** `buffer ++ [m]` — the new message goes to the BACK
(tail), behind every message already waiting. Fail-closed at capacity is enforced at the kernel
transition (`queueEnqueueK`); this is the raw order operation. -/
def qbufEnqueue (buf : List Nat) (m : Nat) : List Nat := buf ++ [m]

/-- **Dequeue from the buffer (the FIFO REMOVE-FROM-FRONT).** Returns `(head, rest)` — the FRONT message
(the oldest waiting) and the remaining buffer. `none` when empty (fail-closed at the kernel transition). -/
def qbufDequeue (buf : List Nat) : Option (Nat × List Nat) :=
  match buf with
  | []      => none
  | m :: ms => some (m, ms)

/-- **FIFO ORDER — PROVED (the load-bearing non-vacuity).** Enqueue `a` then `b` into ANY buffer, then
dequeue: the FIRST dequeue returns `a` (the older), and dequeuing the remainder returns `b`. Order is
PRESERVED — `a` before `b` — exactly because enqueue appends to the back and dequeue removes the front.
A flag/no-op model could not state this (no order); a two-pointer cell-field model (dregg1's
`apply.rs`) cannot prove it past the 0→1 transition (the documented advancement gap). The full `List`
buffer can. -/
theorem qbuf_fifo_order (buf : List Nat) (a b : Nat) :
    qbufDequeue (qbufEnqueue (qbufEnqueue buf a) b) =
      (match qbufDequeue buf with

  cases buf with

/-- **FIFO ORDER on the EMPTY buffer — PROVED (the witnessed `a`-then-`b` instance).** Starting empty,
enqueue `a` then `b`, dequeue → `a` (the older) with `[b]` remaining; dequeue the remainder → `b`. The
concrete order witness the `#eval` exhibits. -/

    qbufDequeue (qbufEnqueue (qbufEnqueue [] a) b) = some (a, [b]) ∧
      qbufDequeue [b] = some (b, []) := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- **EMPTY DEQUEUE fail-closed — PROVED.** Dequeue on the empty buffer is rejected (`none`). The
emptiness gate that the kernel transition lifts to `none`. -/
theorem qbuf_empty_dequeue : qbufDequeue ([] : List Nat) = none := rfl

exactly one more than before (the counter the capacity bound tracks). -/

/-! ### The SWISS-TABLE side-table — a REAL CapTP export/enliven/handoff/GC registry (Wave-8 de-THIN).

dregg1's CapTP transport (`turn/src/action.rs` `ExportSturdyRef`/`EnlivenRef`/`ValidateHandoff`/`DropRef`;
`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:3879 apply_export_sturdy_ref` / `:3955 apply_enliven_ref` /
`:4035 apply_drop_ref` / `:4109 apply_validate_handoff`) keeps a swiss-table: an EXPORT mints an
unguessable swiss number → (target cell, exported permission tier) entry and bumps an export counter;
an ENLIVEN VALIDATES a presented swiss number against the committed table (membership, fail-closed if
absent) and bumps the entry's use-count; a HANDOFF binds a 3-vat introduce CERT to the entry; a DROP
GCs a reference (decrement-fail-closed-at-zero, `apply.rs:4051`). dregg1 scatters this across cell
state fields (field[5]=refcount, field[6]=use-count, field[7]=export-counter) + a federation mirror; we
model the REAL MECHANISM as a first-class swiss-table side-table keyed by swiss number, carrying the
exported `cap`'s rights + a REFCOUNT (the GC counter) + the bound handoff `cert`. This is NOT a
flag-shadow: export INSERTS, enliven LOOKS-UP-fail-closed-and-validates, handoff binds the cert, the
refcount tracks live references and the entry is GC'd at zero. The export/enliven NON-AMPLIFICATION
(claimed rights ⊆ entry rights) is the real CapTP soundness gate (`apply.rs:3917`, `:3999`). -/

ref), the `target` cell the sturdy ref points to, the exported `rights` (the permission tier a bearer
obtains on enliven — bound into the AIR's `EXPORT_PERMISSIONS`), the `refcount` (the GC counter — # of
LIVE references; the entry is GC'd when it hits 0, `apply.rs:4051`), and the bound handoff `cert`
(`none` until a 3-vat introduce cert is validated against this entry; `some h` once bound). -/

/-! ## §MULTI-ASSET — the per-asset `CONSERVATION_VECTOR` over the REAL executable state + gate.

`recKExec`/`recTotal` above conserve ONE scalar (the `balance` field). A dregg cell holds MANY
assets, and conservation must be PER-ASSET — a committed turn moving asset `a` must leave EVERY
other asset's supply *literally untouched*; folding all assets into one aggregate would let a cell
silently swap asset A for asset B while the scalar stays put (`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`;
`DREGG2-GAP-MAP.md FILL 1`, "the #1 soundness gap"). `Exec.MultiAsset` proved exactly this — but
over a deliberately PARALLEL `MACellId`/`maAuthorizedB` toy that "cannot clash with `Kernel.CellId`"
and is imported by nothing executable (a sibling law). Here we re-prove it over the REAL
`RecordKernelState.bal` ledger and the REAL `authorizedB k.caps` gate — the SAME state type and
authority the FFI's `execFullTurn` runs — so the per-asset law is no longer a sibling. (Migrating
the executable `FullAction` dispatch onto `bal` + the negative differential is the next phase.) -/

/-- The per-asset balance ledger after a transfer of asset `a`: debit `src`, credit `dst` in the

/-! ## Per-asset ACCOUNT-GROWTH: a fresh cell, born EMPTY in every asset (`META-FILL C`).

dregg1's `Effect::CreateCell` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:748`) is a PRIVILEGED creation of a FRESH
cell that — per `apply_create_cell`'s `CreateCellNonZeroBalance` rejection (`apply.rs:757`) — is born
with `balance == 0` (`Cell::with_balance(.,.,0)`): conservation-NEUTRAL. We grow the per-asset ledger's
index set (`accounts`) while keeping the conserved measure `recTotalAsset` UNCHANGED, by INSERTING the
fresh cell AND resetting its `bal` column to `0` for every asset — so the new term in the sum is exactly
`0`. The `bal`-reset is LOAD-BEARING: a freshly-inserted id that had EVER been credited (a re-inserted
previously-credited id) would silently re-introduce supply on insert. Resetting unconditionally defends
against that (neutrality is PROVED, not assumed). -/

/-- **`createCellIntoAsset` — grow `accounts` by the fresh `newCell` AND reset its per-asset `bal`
column to `0`.** The per-asset analog of `EffectsSupply.createCellInto`, over the `bal` ledger rather
than the named `balance` field. The fresh cell is born EMPTY in EVERY asset (dregg1-faithful
`balance == 0`), so it contributes exactly `0` to every `recTotalAsset b`. -/

/-- **`recTotalAsset_insert_fresh` — ACCOUNT-GROWTH IS CONSERVATION-NEUTRAL (PROVED).** Growing
`accounts` by a FRESH `newCell` while resetting its `bal` column leaves `recTotalAsset k b` UNCHANGED
for EVERY asset `b`. NON-VACUOUS: the conclusion is an equality of sums over a STRICTLY LARGER index set
(`insert newCell k.accounts`) — it asserts the fresh cell contributes EXACTLY `0` (not that `accounts`
is unchanged: it genuinely grew). The fresh term is `0` because the `bal`-reset wrote it `0`; every OLD
cell is unchanged because `c ≠ newCell` (`hfresh`). Mirrors `EffectsSupply.createCellInto_recTotal`:
`Finset.sum_insert hfresh` for the fresh term + `Finset.sum_congr` for the old cells. Without the
`bal`-reset, a re-inserted previously-credited id would make this FALSE (the supply-amplification hole),
so the reset is load-bearing. -/

The `recKExec` transfer above is balance-CONSERVING (the `transfer` effect, Σδ = 0). But dregg1's
escrow is NOT a transfer: `apply_create_escrow` debits ONE cell and parks the value in the off-ledger
`escrows` side-table; `apply_release_escrow`/`apply_refund_escrow` credit ONE cell and mark the
record resolved. So per-effect Σδ ≠ 0 on the cell ledger; the conserved quantity is the COMBINED
total (cell-ledger + the value held by unresolved escrows). This section models that faithfully and
proves the REAL invariant: value is conserved ACROSS the create+release/refund pair, with the
side-table accounting for the in-flight amount. -/

/-! ## §ESCROW-PER-ASSET — the off-ledger holding-store on the GENUINE per-asset `bal` ledger (`META-FILL C`).

The scalar escrow above (`createEscrowRaw`/`settleEscrowRaw`, `escrowHeld`/`recTotalWithEscrow`)
moves the named `balance` FIELD — ONE asset. But dregg cells hold MANY assets, so an escrow lock
parks `amount` of a SPECIFIC asset (`EscrowRecord.asset`), and the COMBINED conserved quantity must
be PER-ASSET: a lock DROPS that asset's `bal`-ledger supply by `amount` AND RAISES the per-asset
holding-store by `amount` (combined fixed AT that asset), with EVERY OTHER asset literally untouched.
Folding all assets into one combined scalar would let an escrow swap asset A for asset B while the
aggregate stays put — the cross-asset-laundering hole at the holding-store boundary.

We re-found the escrow lifecycle onto the per-asset `bal` ledger via the single-cell `recBalCreditCell`
(the per-asset analog of `recCredit`/`recDebit` — a single-cell, single-asset move), define the
per-asset held sum + combined measure, and re-prove the four conserves-combined facts PER-ASSET as
DROP-IN swaps of the scalar decomposition (the find?/markResolved list lockstep is ASSET-AGNOSTIC; we
narrow the matched-record drop by `r.asset = b`). The scalar escrow stays as the legacy `cell`-view;
these are NEW per-asset SIBLINGS, never a re-proof of the same statement. -/

/-- **`recBalCreditCell` — single-cell, single-asset credit on the per-asset `bal` ledger.** Add `amt`
to cell `c`'s asset `a` column, leaving every other (cell, asset) pair literally untouched. The
per-asset analog of `recCredit` (which moved the scalar `balance` FIELD); `recBalCreditCell c a (-amt)`
is the per-asset DEBIT. This is the per-asset escrow's single-cell move (dregg1's `set_balance`, but
at a NAMED asset column rather than the scalar field). Lives HERE in `RecordKernel` (upstream of both
`TurnExecutorFull` and `EffectsPaired`) so both the executed dispatch and the chained escrow can use
it; it is definitionally the same shape as `TurnExecutorFull.recBalCredit`. -/

/-! ## §BRIDGE — the cross-chain bridge lock/finalize/cancel on the SHARED escrow holding-store (Wave-5).

dregg1's two-phase bridge (`turn/src/action.rs` `BridgeLock`/`BridgeFinalize`/`BridgeCancel`,
`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:1258`/`:1290`/`:1317`, lowered to `cell/src/note_bridge.rs`
`initiate_bridge`/`finalize_bridge`/`cancel_bridge`) is the bridge-shaped TWIN of escrow:

  * **bridgeLock** (Phase 1, `initiate_bridge`): DEBIT the originator + PARK the value in a `Locked`
    `PendingBridge` record — value inaccessible, AWAITING the other-chain confirmation. The off-ledger
    record is the SAME holding-store as escrow (`PendingBridgeSet` ≈ `escrows`), so we reuse the escrow
    store with a `bridge := true` tag. Double-lock REJECTED (`AlreadyLocked` — dregg1's `is_locked`).
    Combined per-asset CONSERVED (the debit is offset by the held rise) — IDENTICAL to `createEscrow`.
  * **bridgeFinalize** (Phase 3, `finalize_bridge`): the §8 confirmation receipt arrived and verified
    (the destination-federation signature over the nullifier — `verify_bridge_receipt`, the §8 portal);
    the lock resolves and the value LEAVES for the other chain. dregg1 marks the record `Finalized` AND
    makes the nullifier permanent (a real BURN on this side). On the COMBINED measure this is a
    no-credit resolve: the bare `bal` is untouched (the value already left the ledger at lock) but the
    held value DROPS — so `recTotalAssetWithEscrow` DROPS by the bridged amount, a DISCLOSED OUTFLOW
    (like burn). This is the ONE place the holding-store pair does NOT conserve — and honestly so.
  * **bridgeCancel** (Phase 4, `cancel_bridge`): the timeout was reached without a receipt; the note is
    UNLOCKED and the value REFUNDED to the originator. dregg1 marks the record `Cancelled`; the value
    returns to the locker. On the COMBINED measure this is a SETTLE back to the creator (credit + resolve)
    — combined per-asset CONSERVED, IDENTICAL to `refundEscrow`.

We reuse `createEscrowRawAsset` (tagged `bridge := true`), `settleEscrowRawAsset` (for cancel/refund),
`markResolved` (for finalize), and the per-asset held-sum lemmas verbatim — the bridge tag is INERT to
the find?/markResolved lockstep (it filters on `id ∧ unresolved`, not on `bridge`), so all the proof
spine carries. The §8 receipt is carried as a `Prop`-carrier hypothesis exactly as `bridgeMint`'s
foreign finality. -/

/-- **`createBridgeRawAsset`** — the per-asset bridge LOCK: a SINGLE-cell, single-asset DEBIT of `amount`
from the originator's asset `asset` column PLUS an insert of an UNRESOLVED, `bridge := true`-tagged
`EscrowRecord` into the SHARED off-ledger holding-store. The `bal`-ledger supply of `asset` DROPS by
`amount`; the per-asset holding-store at `asset` RISES by `amount`; the COMBINED per-asset total at
`asset` is preserved — IDENTICAL shape to `createEscrowRawAsset`, only the `bridge` tag differs. -/
def createBridgeRawAsset (k : RecordKernelState) (id originator destination : CellId) (asset : AssetId)

                        amount := amount, resolved := false, asset := asset, bridge := true } :: k.escrows }

/-- **`bridgeFinalizeRawAsset`** — the bridge FINALIZE body: mark the found record resolved WITHOUT a
credit. The `bal`-ledger is LEFT UNTOUCHED (the value already left the ledger at lock and now leaves for
the other chain — a BURN), but the per-asset holding-store DROPS by `amount` as the record leaves the
unresolved set. So the COMBINED per-asset total DROPS by `amount` — a disclosed OUTFLOW (NOT a settle
back onto the ledger). The honest contrast with `settleEscrowRawAsset` (which credits, conserving). -/
def bridgeFinalizeRawAsset (k : RecordKernelState) (id : Nat) : RecordKernelState :=
  { k with escrows := markResolved k.escrows id }

/-- **`bridgeLockKAsset` (executable, fail-closed).** Commits only when the actor is authorized over the
originator cell (same `authorizedB` gate as `transfer`/escrow-create), the amount is non-negative and
available *in asset `asset`*, the originator is a live account, and the `id` is NOT already in use
(dregg1's `AlreadyLocked` double-lock rejection — `is_locked`). On commit: single-cell debit + park the
bridge-tagged record. The §8 spending proof is carried at the theorem layer. -/

  else none

/-- **`bridgeFinalizeKAsset` (executable, fail-closed).** Looks up the unresolved record by `id` AND
checks the parked record's `(asset, amount)` MATCH the receipt-DISCLOSED `(asset, amount)` (dregg1's
finalize verifies the receipt against the pending bridge — `finalize_bridge` checks nullifier/destination
consistency); on a match, marks it resolved WITHOUT a credit — the value LEFT for the other chain (the
burn). The §8 confirmation receipt (the destination-federation signature, `verify_bridge_receipt`) is the
THEOREM-level portal — here we model the LEDGER move gated on the record being present-and-unresolved (the
`Locked`-state gate) AND matching the disclosed outflow. Rejects a missing/already-resolved/mismatched

PRESERVES the COMBINED per-asset total `recTotalAssetWithEscrow b` for EVERY asset `b`: at the locked

sums on `resolved`/`asset`, not `bridge`), so this is the per-asset escrow-create proof verbatim with

/-! ## §QUEUE-DEPOSIT — the REFUNDABLE ANTI-SPAM DEPOSIT (Wave-8 residual close).

dregg1's `apply_queue_enqueue` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:3372-3386`) does TWO things: it appends the
message hash to the FIFO buffer AND it moves a REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT — `set_balance(actor - deposit)` +
`set_balance(queue + deposit)`, gated on `actor_cell.state.balance() >= deposit` (`:3361`, fail-closed
`InsufficientBalance`). `apply_queue_dequeue` (`:3483-3501`) REFUNDS the per-message deposit to the
dequeuer (`set_balance(queue - refund)` + `set_balance(dequeuer + refund)`). Wave-7 installed the
message-ORDER but left the deposit unmodeled (`queueEnqueueK`/`queueDequeueK` bal-NEUTRAL). We CLOSE
that residual: the deposit is a REFUNDABLE PARK — value leaves the sender's `bal` ledger and is held
OFF-ledger (in the SHARED escrow holding-store, tagged to the queue) until the dequeuer claims its
refund. This is IDENTICAL in shape to `createEscrowRawAsset`/`settleEscrowRawAsset` (the proven
combined-conservation pair) — so `recTotalAsset` GENUINELY MOVES at enqueue (the deposit leaves the
ledger), while the COMBINED `recTotalAssetWithEscrow` is CONSERVED (the parked value is counted in the
holding-store). The dequeuer's refund settles it back (combined conserved again). The deposit record
reuses `EscrowRecord` with `creator := sender` (refund-on-fail target), `recipient := queueOwner`,
keyed by the deposit `id`; it lives in `escrows`, INERT to the FIFO buffer / queue side-table.

We COMPOSE the FIFO transition (`queueEnqueueK`/`queueDequeueK`, carrying ALL the order/capacity/owner/
emptiness gates UNCHANGED) with the escrow PARK/SETTLE (carrying the deposit + the combined-conservation
spine UNCHANGED): the two operate on DISJOINT state slices (`queues` vs `bal`+`escrows`), so they
commute and BOTH bodies of proof carry verbatim. -/

/-- **`queueEnqueueDepositK`** — APPEND `m` to the tail of queue `id`'s FIFO buffer (the Wave-7
order op, fail-closed if absent OR FULL) AND PARK a refundable anti-spam `deposit` of asset `dAsset`
from `sender` into the SHARED holding-store, keyed by the deposit-record id `depId`, with
`creator := sender` (refund target) and `recipient := owner` (the queue owner). Fail-closed if the FIFO
gate rejects, if the deposit is negative, if `sender` lacks the deposit IN that asset
(`apply.rs:3361`), if `sender` is not a live account, or if the deposit-record `depId` is already in
use. The `bal` ledger of `dAsset` DROPS by `deposit` (a real per-asset debit — `recTotalAsset` MOVES)
while the holding-store at `dAsset` RISES by `deposit` (COMBINED conserved), EXACTLY like
`createEscrowRawAsset`. -/

      else none

/-- **`queueDequeueRefundK`** — REMOVE-FROM-FRONT of queue `id`'s FIFO buffer (the Wave-7 order op,
gated on `actor = owner`, fail-closed if absent / not-owner / EMPTY) AND REFUND the deposit-record
`depId` to the dequeuer `actor` (`apply.rs:3483`: the dequeuer reclaims the per-message deposit). The
refund single-cell CREDITS `actor` at the record's asset and marks the deposit record resolved — value
RETURNS to the ledger (`recTotalAsset` rises) while the holding-store DROPS (COMBINED conserved),
EXACTLY like `settleEscrowRawAsset`. Fail-closed if the FIFO gate rejects OR the deposit record is
absent/already-resolved. Returns the post-state AND the dequeued head message (the FIFO witness). -/
