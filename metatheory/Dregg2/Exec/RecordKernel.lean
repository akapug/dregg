# Dregg2.Exec.RecordKernel — the kernel laws over a CONTENT-ADDRESSED record cell-state.

`Exec/Kernel.lean` is the verified *micro-core*: its `KernelState.bal : CellId → ℤ` is a single
scalar ledger, and `exec_conserves`/`exec_authorized`/`exec_unauthorized_fails` are PROVED over
that whole-state ℤ. But the concrete dregg2 cell is NOT a scalar — it is `Exec/Value.lean`'s
schema-keyed record `Value` (named fields, `flatten`/`width`/`conforms`, `flatten_width` PROVED).
The construction study's single-highest-leverage move (`.docs-history-noclaude/rebuild/dregg2-design/PHASE-CONSTRUCTION.md §1`,
"The single highest-leverage next move") is to replace the toy scalar ledger with that
content-addressed record cell and re-prove the kernel laws over a NAMED FIELD (`balance`) rather
than the whole-state ℤ — aligning the conserved quantity with `Spec/Conservation`'s domain-typed
conservation (`conservedInDomain Domain.balance`).

This module does exactly that, as a SECOND, parallel kernel ALONGSIDE the scalar one (the
sanctioned fallback when a full in-place lift of `KernelState` ripples too far — here it ripples
across ~8 `Finset.sum`-heavy `Exec/*` files). The toy scalar kernel stays UNTOUCHED and green; we
add `RecordKernelState` + `recKExec` whose cell-state is a `Value` record, conserve the **`balance`
field**, and re-prove ALL THREE kernel laws + the four-conjunct `StepInv` over it. The conserved
quantity becomes a domain measure over a named field — the `Spec.conservedInDomain Domain.balance`
shape — so this is the concrete-instance seam between "verified micro-core" and "verified dregg".

`flatten_width` (from `Value.lean`) is the foundation lemma the *circuit* side rests on; the
*semantic* re-proof here rests on `Value.scalar "balance"` (the named-field read), reusing
`Exec/Kernel.lean`'s already-proved `sum_indicator` over the `balance`-field measure.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Imports `Exec.Program` (for `Value.scalar`/`Value.field`) and
`Exec.Kernel` (for `CellId`/`Turn`/`authorizedB`/`Caps` + the reused `sum_indicator`).

def balanceField : FieldName := "balance"

/-- **An asset identity IS its issuer cell's identity** (W1 value unification, DREGG3 §2.2
Asset): `AssetId := CellId`. Every asset is the promise of ONE issuer cell; the issuer's own
balance row in its asset is the (negative-capable) WELL carrying −supply, so `∀ a, Σ_c bal c a = 0`
exactly (`ExactConservation`, §VALUE-UNIFY below). Mint authority = control of the issuer cell.

A dregg cell holds MANY assets, and conservation must be **per-asset**, never one aggregate scalar
(`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`; `dregg2 §2.1`). A turn that moves 5 of asset 0 must leave the
supply of asset 1 *literally untouched* — folding all assets into one sum would let a cell silently
swap one asset for another while the aggregate stays put. The conserved quantity is therefore a
*family* indexed by `AssetId` (see `§MULTI-ASSET` below). -/

absent/ill-typed field to `0` (fail-soft on the *measure*: a malformed record contributes `0` to

is the named-field measure that replaces `KernelState.bal`'s whole-state scalar. -/

/-! ### SLOT CAVEATS — the per-slot invariants a factory binds onto a cell's fields.

dregg1's `FactoryDescriptor` (`cell/src/factory.rs`) attaches a `program : RecordProgram` whose
`StateConstraint`s (`cell/src/program.rs:570`, "**21 variants**") are checked by the executor on
EVERY `SetField`/`CellProgram::Cases` transition (`evaluate`, `cell/src/program.rs:1314`+). This is
the foundation that makes a starbridge-app's published safety REAL: a `nameservice` slot bound
`Immutable` is *registered forever* because the EXECUTOR rejects any later rewrite, not because some
downstream theorem merely carries the wish.

`SlotCaveat` names the six transition caveats the executor checks PER FIELD — the actor-aware,
name-keyed transcription of the corresponding `StateConstraint` arms (`cell/src/program.rs`):
  * `immutable f`        — `Immutable { index }`        (`:624` / eval `:1314`): `new == old`.
  * `monotonicSeq f`     — `MonotonicSequence { seq }`  (`:719` / eval `:1862`): `new == old + 1`.
  * `monotonic f`        — `Monotonic { index }`        (`:639` / eval `:1364`): `new ≥ old`.
  * `writeOnce f`        — `WriteOnce { index }`         (`:619` / eval `:1337`): `old = 0 ∨ new = old`.
  * `senderAuthorized f authorized` — `SenderAuthorized { set }` (`:675` / eval `:1576`): the actor
    must be a member of the slot's authorized set (the membership-witness crypto is the §8 portal;
    here the set is the EXECUTABLE authorized list the executor checks `actor ∈`).
  * `boundedBy f lo hi`  — `BoundedBy`/`FieldDeltaInRange` family (`:489`/`:636`, eval `:1424`): the
    bounded-value caveat `lo ≤ new ≤ hi` (the executable shadow of the range gate).

`old` defaults to `0` for an absent/ill-typed slot — dregg1's `FIELD_ZERO` default for a fresh slot
(`old_state.map(|o| o.fields[idx]).unwrap_or(FIELD_ZERO)`, `cell/src/program.rs:1331`). The
evaluator is decidable, computable, and FAIL-CLOSED (a violated caveat ⇒ `false` ⇒ the write is
rejected). -/
inductive SlotCaveat where
  /-- `Immutable { index }` (`cell/src/program.rs:624`, eval `:1314`): the slot is read-only —
  `new == old` (no rewrite). A `nameservice` `owner` slot bound here is *registered forever*. -/
  | immutable        (field : FieldName)
  /-- `MonotonicSequence { seq_index }` (`:719`, eval `:1862`): `new == old + 1` — replay-safe
  sequencing (a subscription head/tail advances by exactly one). -/
  | monotonicSeq     (field : FieldName)
  /-- `Monotonic { index }` (`:639`, eval `:1364`): `new ≥ old` — append-only counter / expiry
  extension / nullifier-root growth. -/
  | monotonic        (field : FieldName)
  /-- `WriteOnce { index }` (`:619`, eval `:1337`): `old == FIELD_ZERO` (first write) OR `new == old`
  (unchanged); after the first non-zero write the slot is frozen. -/
  | writeOnce        (field : FieldName)
  /-- `SenderAuthorized { set }` (`:675`, eval `:1576`): the turn's actor must be a member of the
  slot's `authorized` set. (The Merkle/blinded membership *proof* is the §8 Prop-carrier portal; the
  EXECUTABLE check here is `actor ∈ authorized`.) -/
  | senderAuthorized (field : FieldName) (authorized : List CellId)
  /-- `BoundedBy`/`FieldDeltaInRange` range family (`:489`/`:636`, eval `:1424`): the new value must
  lie in `[lo, hi]` (a bounded-growth / windowed slot). -/
  | boundedBy        (field : FieldName) (lo hi : Int)
  /-- **`admitTable { index, transitions }`** — the EXECUTABLE realization of an arbitrary per-slot
  admission predicate the six prior caveats CANNOT express (op-allowlist, prefix-on-PUT,
  GET-clearance, DAG-prereqs, per-step-clearance). dregg1's general `RecordProgram::Cases`
  (`cell/src/program.rs`) lets a factory bind a finite *decision table* of admitted `(old, new)`
  scalar transitions on a slot; the executor admits a write iff its `(old, new)` is in the table —
  fail-closed otherwise. A mandate computes this table ONCE (from its clearance graph / DAG / op
  allowlist) and bakes it into the cell's program, so the SAME admission the off-line predicate
  decides is now decided BY THE EXECUTOR on every `SetField`. This is what makes `cwmAdvanceM` /
  `sgmAdmitM` load-bearing: a no-clearance step / out-of-DAG advance is simply NOT in the table, so
  the executor rejects it (where a `monotonicSeq`/`boundedBy` caveat would wrongly admit). -/
  | admitTable       (field : FieldName) (transitions : List (Int × Int))
  /-- **`clearanceGe { field, g, actorClearances, box }`** — the SGM clearance mandate, now
  enforceable INLINE by the live executor (not precomputed into an `admitTable`). A write to this
  slot is admitted iff the writing `actor`'s clearance label — looked up in the published
  `actorClearances : List (CellId × Int)` table, as a numeric `Label.id` — DOMINATES the slot's
  sensitivity label `box` in the clearance graph `g` (`ClearanceGraph.dominatesD`, the
  proved-sound primitive `Authority/ClearanceGraph.lean:53,92`). Fail-closed: an actor absent from
  the clearance table cannot write. This wires the orphaned-but-proved lattice into the
  executor-enforced caveat surface that `stateStepGuarded`/`setFieldA` consults — so an
  under-cleared actor's write is rejected BY THE EXECUTOR, not merely by an app mandate. -/

FIRST write on a fresh cell `nonce==0`)? The four TRANSITION caveats (immutable/writeOnce/monotonic/
monotonicSeq) permit any first write (they only constrain SUBSEQUENT transitions); the ABSOLUTE
caveats (`boundedBy` value-range, `senderAuthorized` set-membership) still constrain the

/-! ### The FACTORY DESCRIPTOR — a published contract that mints conforming, caveat-bound cells.

dregg1's `FactoryDescriptor` (`cell/src/factory.rs`) is a content-addressed contract: the executor
validates a `CreateCellFromFactory` against the factory's declared constraints
(`validate_and_record`, `apply_create_cell_from_factory`, `turn/src/executor/apply.rs:3112`+), then
mints a cell carrying the factory's `program` (its slot caveats), `initialFields`, and `programVk`.

every minted child carries for its WHOLE LIFE. -/

a well-formed factory cannot publish initial fields that already VIOLATE the invariants it claims to
enforce (e.g. a `BoundedBy [10,20]` slot born at `25`) or smuggle scalar balance into the record while
the per-asset ledger is born empty. Decidable, computable, FAIL-CLOSED. Each caveat reads its own field's

`RelCaveat.fieldLteOther` (capacity / no-underflow). The FIFO-order shadow (`qbufEnqueue`/

destruction). The per-effect arms still gate `cellLifecycleLive` on the TARGET (Live-ONLY), so a
Sealed agent's transfer/set-field/etc. STILL fails the body — only the lifecycle-control effects

`recKExec`/`recTotal` above conserve ONE scalar (the `balance` field). A dregg cell holds MANY
assets, and conservation must be PER-ASSET — a committed turn moving asset `a` must leave EVERY
other asset's supply *literally untouched*; folding all assets into one aggregate would let a cell
silently swap asset A for asset B while the scalar stays put (`EFFECT-ISA-DESIGN.md:315,320-323`;
the per-asset CONSERVATION_VECTOR — the #1 soundness gap of a single-scalar ledger).
`Exec.MultiAsset` proved exactly this — but
over a deliberately PARALLEL `MACellId`/`maAuthorizedB` toy that "cannot clash with `Kernel.CellId`"
and is imported by nothing executable (a sibling law). Here we re-prove it over the REAL
`RecordKernelState.bal` ledger and the REAL `authorizedB k.caps` gate — the SAME state type and
authority the FFI's `execFullTurn` runs — so the per-asset law is not a sibling. (Migrating
the executable `FullAction` dispatch onto `bal` + the negative differential is the next phase.) -/

/-! ## Per-asset ACCOUNT-GROWTH: a fresh cell, born EMPTY in every asset (`META-FILL C`).

dregg1's `Effect::CreateCell` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:748`) is a PRIVILEGED creation of a FRESH
cell that — per `apply_create_cell`'s `CreateCellNonZeroBalance` rejection (`apply.rs:757`) — is born
with `balance == 0` (`Cell::with_balance(.,.,0)`): conservation-NEUTRAL. We grow the per-asset ledger's
index set (`accounts`) while keeping the conserved measure `recTotalAsset` UNCHANGED, by INSERTING the
fresh cell AND resetting its `bal` column to `0` for every asset — so the new term in the sum is exactly
`0`. The `bal`-reset is LOAD-BEARING: a freshly-inserted id that had EVER been credited (a re-inserted
previously-credited id) would silently re-introduce supply on insert. Resetting unconditionally defends
against that (neutrality is PROVED, not assumed). -/

(`insert newCell k.accounts`) — it asserts the fresh cell contributes EXACTLY `0` (not that `accounts`
is unchanged: it grew). The fresh term is `0` because the `bal`-reset wrote it `0`; every OLD
cell is unchanged because `c ≠ newCell` (`hfresh`). Mirrors `EffectsSupply.createCellInto_recTotal`:
`Finset.sum_insert hfresh` for the fresh term + `Finset.sum_congr` for the old cells. Without the
`bal`-reset, a re-inserted previously-credited id would make this FALSE (the supply-amplification hole),

/-! ### §CAP-REVOKE — the credential-revocation WRITER (the def `:319`/`:438` have DESCRIBED forever).

dregg1's `credentials/src/revocation.rs` inserts a credential's id into a grow-only
`RevocationRegistry` (`HashSet<[u8;32]>`, insert-only). The kernel-state model is the `revoked : List Nat`
registry (§ line 319) plus its committed accumulator `revokedRoot` (§ line 434): `cap_revoke` GROWS the
registry AND advances the committed root (`:438`, "cap_revoke INSERTS on revocation"). Until now those
docstrings named an op with no def behind it — a perfect lock on an empty registry: the reader
(`gateOK_revoked_fails`, `kernel_revoked_gate_fails`) was proven, the WRITER never built.

This is the writer. It is GROW-ONLY (a re-revocation is a harmless idempotent insert, NOT a
fail-closed reject — the accumulator-backed `revokeCredentialAcc` in the bridge only admits a witness for
a genuinely-fresh `credNul`, so the committed root advances exactly once per distinct revocation). The
committed root is advanced to `newRoot` here (an OPAQUE `Digest8` at the kernel layer, matching how
`RecordKernelState` stores `revokedRoot` as a bare `Fin 8 → ℤ`); the FAITHFULNESS that `newRoot` actually
contains `credNul` is discharged one level up by `revokeCredentialAcc_present`, where the
`NfAccWitness` lives (the crypto layer `RecordKernel` deliberately does not import). Balance-NEUTRAL. -/

/-! ## §VALUE-UNIFY — `ExactConservation`: THE per-asset value law of the kernel (W1, DREGG3 R2).

The R2 probe (`Dregg2/Substrate/IssuerSupplyProbe.lean`, standalone) established the issuer-supply
value law: `AssetId := issuer CellId`, the issuer carries −supply in a negative-capable well, and
conservation is `∀ a, Σ_{c ∈ accounts} bal c a = 0` EXACTLY — no modulo-burn, no bridge-outflow
exemption, no mint inflation. `Substrate/IssuerLedger.lean` promoted it to the canonical forward
model. THIS section lands the law in the REAL kernel (in the anchor, over the real step functions).

F1b COLLAPSED the transitional form: the kernel escrow holding-store is GONE, so the law is the PURE
cell-sum — NO off-ledger term, NO exemptions. Escrow/obligation/bridge-LFC value parks in factory
cells' OWN `bal` columns (`Apps/{EscrowFactory,ObligationFactory,BridgeCell}.lean`), covered by the
SAME sum; the bridge outflow dies in the bridge cell's pot column (the `BridgeCell` contract), which
is exactly the S3 pot-cell ending the old transitional doc promised.

Mint/burn-as-issuer-moves land beside the executor (`Dregg2/Exec/IssuerMove.lean`); the per-asset fee
quadruple lands on the turn wrapper (`Dregg2/Circuit/Argus/Turn.lean §6'`); the E4 shielded
value-binding lands in `Dregg2/Exec/ShieldedValue.lean`. -/

/-- **THE VALUE LAW (W1).** Per asset: the cell-ledger sum is 0. The issuer of each asset is an
ordinary live account whose well runs NEGATIVE by exactly the circulating supply
(`IssuerSupplyProbe.issuerView_exact` proves the issuer-supply view satisfies this BY CONSTRUCTION).
F1b: there is NO off-ledger escrow term — escrow value lives in factory cells' own `bal`
columns, which this SAME sum covers. -/
