# Dregg2.Exec.SystemRoots — STAGE 3 of the record-layer upgrade: the dedicated
`system_roots` sub-block (Option C1 of `_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md` §C).

`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md` §C + `_IR-EXTENSION-DESIGN.md` §A/§E. The IR-extension's only error was its
HOME for the side-table roots: it stole the user `fields[1..7]` cells (`_IR-EXTENSION-DESIGN.md:138-143`),
colliding with app data (`subscription` is 8/8-full; `governed-namespace` wants its own slots 6,7).
STAGE 0–2 already FREED the user namespace: keys `≥ 8` overflow onto `FieldsMap.fieldsRoot`. STAGE 3
gives the side-table roots their OWN namespace so they never collide with user fields again.

This module is the dedicated home (the reconciliation of `_IR-EXTENSION-DESIGN.md` onto a separate
namespace). It supplies, in ONE place:

  * **The kernel-owned root INDICES** (`systemRoot` namespace): each side-table gets its OWN fixed
    index in the `system_roots` sub-block —
    `ESCROW · QUEUE · REFCOUNT · STURDYREF · DELEG · NULLIFIER · COMMIT · SEALED_BOXES`. This is the
    home that makes the per-effect side-table descriptors (`EffectVmEmitCreateEscrow` etc.) BINDABLE:
    their root-update gate writes index `i`, never a user `fields[j]`. The reconciliation note
    (`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md:246-250`) re-targets each emit file's root from `FIELD_BASE+i` onto
    `SYSTEM_ROOT_BASE+i` — these are those constants.

  * **`systemRoots`** — the kernel-owned `[FieldElem; N_SYSTEM_ROOTS]` sub-block, modelled as a total
    function `Fin N_SYSTEM_ROOTS → FieldElem` (the Lean mirror of the Rust `[FieldElement; 8]`).
    `emptySystemRoots` is the all-empty-tree-sentinel default a legacy cell carries.

  * **`systemRootsDigest`** — the SINGLE committed root over the 8 side-table roots, a `ListCommit`-style
    injective `compressN` sponge over the ordered root cells. This is the carrier the circuit absorbs
    into `state_commit` by the same GROUP-4 hash-site mechanism `fields_root` uses (`_RECORD-LAYER-
    UPGRADE.md:227-232`): one column / one absorb input, width-neutral. Apps NEVER address it.

  * **`cellCommitS`** — the canonical cell commitment EXTENDED to absorb `systemRootsDigest` as ONE
    more limb (mirroring how STAGE 1's `RecordCommit.cellCommit` absorbs `fieldsRoot`). The anti-ghost
    tooth + legacy no-op are PROVED over it:
      - `cellCommitS_binds_systemRoots_or_collides` — equal commitments ⇒ equal `systemRootsDigest` ⇒
        the SAME 8 side-table roots, OR a NAMED collision of the deployed sponge at a pair a total
        extractor returns. Tampering ANY side-table root (escrow drop, nullifier omission, …) FLIPS its
        root ⇒ flips the digest ⇒ flips the commitment ⇒ UNSAT against the pinned `state_commit`, unless
        the prover holds that collision. This is the per-effect anti-ghost tooth the coverage memos
        demand, lifted to ALL 8 side-tables at once.
      - `legacy_commitS_absorbs_empty_roots` — a LEGACY cell (all-sentinel `system_roots`)
        commits BYTE-IDENTICALLY to the empty-roots reference: the absorbed digest is the fixed
        `emptySystemRootsDigest` constant, cell-INDEPENDENT, so folding it in is a uniform no-op.
        Legacy cells/commitments are UNCHANGED (strictly additive backward-compat).

  * the VACUITY GUARD (`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md` §D.4): pos + neg `#guard`s, no `native_decide` — a
    populated-side-table cell's commitment DIFFERS from the empty reference (load-bearing), a tampered
    root MOVES it (anti-ghost), and two cells with the SAME roots commit IDENTICALLY (completeness).
    A `systemRootsDigest := 0` stub would collapse the positive guard — forbidden.

Pure, computable, `#guard`-able (no `native_decide`). Reuses `Circuit.ListCommit.listDigest` and the
`Circuit.Poseidon2Binding.SpongeColl` extraction spine — never a new axiom.
`#assert_axioms` whitelists `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

⚑ **THE INJECTIVITY FLOOR IS GONE FROM EVERY BINDING STATEMENT HERE (07-20).** `systemRootsDigest_binds`,
`_binds_fn`, `_binds_pointwise`, `cellCommitS_binds_systemRoots` and `cellCommitS_binds_roots_pointwise`
each carried `StateCommit.compressNInjective` — the same proposition as `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, which
`HashFloorHonesty` REFUTES at the deployed BabyBear parameters. At the deployed sponge they were
vacuously true and bound nothing. They are DELETED and replaced by extraction-as-data forms
(`…_or_collides`) that assume nothing about the sponge and name the colliding pair a total extractor
returns (`rootsCollFind`/`RootsColl`, `cellCommitSCollFind`/`CellCommitSColl`). §3′ proves the strength
relation BOTH ways as standalone bridges — every deleted theorem is recovered as exactly its injective
special case (`…_of_injective`), and the collision disjunct is refutable there (`…_refutable_of_injective`)
while being genuinely inhabited at a degenerate sponge (`badRootsSponge_has_rootsColl`).

Each side-table gets its OWN fixed index in the `system_roots` sub-block. These mirror the Rust
`state::system_root::*` constants and the `_IR-EXTENSION-DESIGN.md` §E close-plan's root assignments,
re-targeted off the user `fields[1..7]` onto this dedicated namespace (`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md`
Option C1). Distinct, kernel-only, never reachable by a `SetField` (which addresses user keys only). -/

def ESCROW       : Nat := 0

/-- **`N_SYSTEM_ROOTS`** — the size of the dedicated `system_roots` sub-block (`= 8`, one per
side-table). Parallel to (and disjoint from) the 8 user `fields[0..7]` and the `fields_root` map. -/
def N_SYSTEM_ROOTS : Nat := 8

/-! ## §2 — the `system_roots` sub-block + its committed digest (`systemRootsDigest`).

The Lean mirror of the Rust `system_roots: [FieldElement; 8]`: a total map `Fin 8 → FieldElem`.
Each index holds ONE side-table's root, mutated ONLY by that side-table's kernel transition (escrow /
queue / nullifier / …), NEVER by a user `SetField`. The committed `systemRootsDigest` is the single
`listDigest` sponge over the 8 ordered roots — the ONE column the circuit absorbs. -/

/-- A field element (the same `ℤ`-carrier `ListCommit`/`StateCommit` use for a Poseidon felt). -/
abbrev FieldElem := ℤ

/-- **`SysRoots`** — the kernel-owned side-table-root sub-block: a total function from the fixed
root index to its committed `FieldElem`. The Lean mirror of the Rust `[FieldElement; N_SYSTEM_ROOTS]`. -/
abbrev SysRoots := Fin N_SYSTEM_ROOTS → FieldElem

/-- **`rootList sr`** — the 8 side-table roots as an ORDERED list (index 0..7), the input the
`systemRootsDigest` sponge commits. Order is fixed by the kernel-owned index assignment (§1), so the
digest is order-canonical (a swap of two side-tables' roots is a DIFFERENT digest). Uses `List.ofFn`
(definitionally `(finRange n).map sr`), so the digest binds the WHOLE function via `List.ofFn_inj`. -/
def rootList (sr : SysRoots) : List FieldElem :=
  List.ofFn sr

/-- **`systemRootsDigest compressN sr`** — the SINGLE committed root over the `system_roots` sub-block:
the `ListCommit.listDigest` over `rootList sr` under the identity leaf (the roots are ALREADY field
elements — each side-table's own `listDigest`/`keyedDigest` produced them). This is the one column the
circuit carries; the GROUP-4 site absorbs it into `state_commit` exactly as it absorbs `fields_root`
(`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md` §C). -/
def systemRootsDigest (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem) (sr : SysRoots) : FieldElem :=
  listDigest id compressN (rootList sr)

/-- **`emptySystemRoots`** — the all-empty-tree-sentinel sub-block a LEGACY cell carries (every
side-table empty). The Lean mirror of the Rust `[FIELD_ZERO; N_SYSTEM_ROOTS]` default. -/
def emptySystemRoots : SysRoots := fun _ => 0

/-- **`emptySystemRootsDigest compressN`** — the FIXED `systemRootsDigest` of an empty sub-block: a
cell-INDEPENDENT constant. A legacy cell carries exactly this, so absorbing it into a commitment is a
uniform no-op (the STAGE 3 backward-compat keystone, next section). -/
def emptySystemRootsDigest (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem) : FieldElem :=
  systemRootsDigest compressN emptySystemRoots

/-! ## §3 — the digest BINDS the WHOLE sub-block — or hands back the colliding pair.

⚑ **WHAT THIS SECTION USED TO ASSUME, AND WHY IT SAID NOTHING.** `systemRootsDigest_binds`,
`_binds_fn` and `_binds_pointwise` each carried `StateCommit.compressNInjective compressN`. That
predicate is literally `∀ xs ys, compressN xs = compressN ys → xs = ys` — the same proposition as
`Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR`, and FALSE at the deployed BabyBear parameters:
`HashFloorHonesty.compressNInjective_false_of_finite_range` / `poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`
refute it by pigeonhole (the infinite `List ℤ` domain compressed into a bounded field). So the three
theorems, and every consumer that instantiated them at the deployed sponge, were VACUOUSLY TRUE
exactly where they were supposed to bind the deployed side-table state. They are DELETED — not kept
beside the new forms, which would be the same sin in additive dress.

The replacement assumes NOTHING. The roots peel is a TOTAL FUNCTION (`rootsCollFind`) that either
proves the ordered root lists equal or hands back the SPECIFIC pair of lists at which the deployed
sponge actually collides. `RootsColl` is a predicate about THAT pair — deliberately NOT
`∃ xs ys, collision`, which pigeonhole makes unconditionally true at deployed parameters and which
would therefore bind nothing at all. The `_of_injective` bridges below recover each deleted statement
as EXACTLY its injective special case, so nothing genuinely proved was given up; what was given up is
the pretence that the deployed sponge satisfies the hypothesis. -/

/-- **`systemRootsDigest_eq_hash_rootList`** — the digest is ONE sponge application over the ordered
root list (`listDigest` under the identity leaf encoder). Definitional: the deployed absorption,
unfolded so the extraction spine applies directly to the roots leg. -/
theorem systemRootsDigest_eq_hash_rootList (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem) (sr : SysRoots) :
    systemRootsDigest compressN sr = compressN (rootList sr) := by
  simp [systemRootsDigest, listDigest]

/-- **`rootsCollFind sr sr'`** — the TOTAL extractor for the roots leg: the SPECIFIC pair of lists at
which two `system_roots` sub-blocks sharing a digest must have collided. The sponge absorbs the ordered
root list directly (one application, no inner group), so the peel is the pair of root lists itself —
still a total function of the inputs, still a pair the caller can name and inspect. -/
def rootsCollFind (sr sr' : SysRoots) : List FieldElem × List FieldElem :=
  (rootList sr, rootList sr')

/-- **`RootsColl compressN sr sr'`** — the pair `rootsCollFind` RETURNS is a GENUINE collision of the
deployed sponge: DISTINCT ordered root lists with the SAME digest. The named disjunct every cured
statement below carries in place of the refuted injectivity floor.

This is the ONE definition of the roots-leg collision in the tree: `Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnable`
(and through it the ~40 per-tag wide keystones) `export`s this name rather than carrying a parallel copy. -/
def RootsColl (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem) (sr sr' : SysRoots) : Prop :=
  SpongeColl compressN (rootsCollFind sr sr')

/-- **⚑ A REFLEXIVE INSTANCE CANNOT HAVE COLLIDED — AT ANY SPONGE.** A collision needs DISTINCT
inputs, and the extractor fed a sub-block against itself returns a pair of identical lists. So a
consumer applied at `sr = sr'` MUST land in the binding branch, with NO injectivity hypothesis
anywhere. This is what lets a non-vacuity witness be discharged HONESTLY: the keystone audit shows the
keystone fires INTO the binding branch rather than escaping through the disjunct, and it needs no toy
sponge to do so. -/

Equal digests EITHER force the SAME ordered root list, OR the pair `rootsCollFind` returns is a genuine
collision of the deployed sponge. So tampering ANY side-table root — a dropped escrow, an omitted
nullifier, a reordered queue — either moves the digest or COSTS the prover a named sponge collision.

⚑ **STRENGTH, stated honestly.** As a FORMULA this is weaker than the deleted equality. As CONTENT AT
DEPLOYED PARAMETERS it is strictly stronger, because the deleted premise is unsatisfiable by the real
compressing sponge: the old theorem said nothing about the deployed system and this one holds OF it. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE, so the disjunction is not a free pass.)** At an
injective sponge the extracted pair is NOT a collision, so a cured statement cannot discharge itself by

right after the `fields_root` absorb). The `rest` prefix abstracts every OTHER limb (identity, mode,

absorbed digest is the same fixed constant for both, so the absorption does not distinguish legacy

/-! ## §5 — VACUITY GUARD (`_RECORD-LAYER-UPGRADE.md` §D.4): pos + neg, no `native_decide`.

Concrete computable instances over the same toy CR sponge the §FieldsMap/§RecordCommit guards use. A
POSITIVE guard: a populated-side-table cell's commitment DIFFERS from the legacy reference (the
absorption is load-bearing). A NO-OP guard: a legacy (all-empty) cell's commitment EQUALS the
empty-roots reference. An ANTI-GHOST guard: tampering ONE side-table root MOVES the commitment. A
`systemRootsDigest := 0` stub would collapse the positive/anti-ghost guards. -/
