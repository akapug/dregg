# Dregg2.Exec.NullifierAccumulator — the NULLIFIER / REVOCATION accumulator gate (executor-side weld)

The double-spend gate (`RecordKernel.noteSpendNullifier`) and the revocation gate
(`FullForestAuth.revocationGate`) carry a whole append-only `List Nat` in kernel state and check
membership by O(#history) scan — so the *entire* spent/revoked set crosses the FFI/wire boundary each
turn. This file is the accumulator gate that replaces that (`docs/SUPERSEDED/NULLIFIER-ACCUMULATOR-DESIGN.md`):
state carries only a fixed-width `Digest8` root, and the *transaction* supplies a client-side
non-membership + insert witness verified against that root. The wire carries the commitment, never
the set.

## Where this sits in the migration (READ THIS)
This is a WELD onto proven infra. It models the accumulator step over a standalone `NfAccState` (the
two roots) — EXACTLY the two `Digest8` fields the VK-epoch flip adds to `RecordKernelState`
(`nullifierRoot`, `revokedRoot`). It is kept as a self-contained model deliberately: literally adding
those fields to `RecordKernelState` is NOT a free additive step — the full-state FRAME theorems
(`Transfer.TransferSpec`, `StateCommit.RestHashIffFrame`, the `RotatedKernelRefinement*` `fr*` frame
structures, every effect's `↔`-spec) each PIN every kernel field, and pinning the new roots forces
the rest-hash `RH` to ABSORB them — which is the VK-epoch commitment change itself. That flip is
ember-gated and coordinated with the parked umem VK epoch (design §6; do NOT fire piecemeal). So the
proofs live here over `NfAccState` now; the flip wires `NfAccState`'s roots INTO `RecordKernelState`
and extends `RH`/the frame apex in one flag-day. See the module comment in `Dregg2.lean` and the
weld report for the exact touch-list.

## The reused, already-proven core (NOT re-proved here)
The sorted/indexed-Merkle-tree non-membership + fresh-key insert are fully proved over the DEPLOYED
`Heap8Scheme` node8 lane (the geometry the circuit's `nullifier_root` @ limb 26 actually rides):

  * `SortedTreeNonMembershipHeap8.nonMembership_sound8` — a valid gap open ⟹ key ABSENT.
  * `SortedTreeNonMembershipHeap8.update_sound8`        — the fresh-key insert grows the committed
                                                          set by EXACTLY the new key.
  * `SortedTreeNonMembershipHeap8.GapOpen8.excludesSpine` — the UNCONDITIONAL combinatorial keystone.

The three security obligations (`docs/SUPERSEDED/NULLIFIER-ACCUMULATOR-DESIGN.md` §4) re-derived over the root:

  (a) `no_double_spend_root`   ← contrapositive of `nonMembership_sound8` (present ⇒ no witness).
  (b) `spend_inserts_root`     ← the `y = nf` disjunct of `update_sound8`.
  (c) `present_no_witness`     ← non-forgeability: an adversary-supplied witness for a PRESENT key is
                                 impossible (combinatorial layer unconditional; the spine↔root
                                 binding `SpineCommits8` rests on the one deployed
                                 `Poseidon2SpongeCR`/`Compress8CR` floor — NO new trust).

## The crypto residue (named, honest)
The SOLE carrier is `SpineCommits8 S8 root spine` — "the sorted key spine is what `root` commits to",
the realizable `compute_canonical_heap_root_8` fold. It is a HYPOTHESIS carried by the witness, never
an axiom, and enters only at the spine↔root step (the deployed `Heap8Scheme` node8 CR). The
bracketing/insert combinatorics are unconditional.

## Non-vacuity (do not launder)
The accept relation is TWO-VALUED: `witness_inhabited_of_bindings` exhibits the TRUE pole (a fresh
key HAS a witness once the bindings realize) and `present_no_witness` is the FALSE pole (a present key
has NONE). The decidable spine-level demos witness the same at the combinatorial layer — a fresh
nullifier is bracketed-excluded (admissible), an already-spent one is present (no gap, gate refuses),
and the insert grows the set by EXACTLY the fresh key.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; `SpineCommits8` is a HYPOTHESIS carried
by the witness, never an axiom; the Poseidon-CR floor enters only through the `Heap8Scheme` carrier
already in play.

/-! ## §0 — the accumulator state (the two roots the VK-epoch flip lands in `RecordKernelState`). -/

/-- **`NfAccState`** — the O(1)-wire accumulator state: two `Digest8` roots, the double-spend
frontier (`nullifierRoot`, `nullifier_root` @ circuit limb 26) and the revocation frontier
(`revokedRoot`). This is EXACTLY the additive pair the VK epoch adds to `RecordKernelState`
(defaulting to the all-zero empty-tree root); the whole spent/revoked set NEVER crosses the wire, only
these commitments do. -/

/-! ## §1 — the client-supplied witness (non-membership + insert, verified against the root). -/

/-- **`NfAccWitness S8 root nf`** — a client-side witness that spending nullifier `nf` is admissible
against the committed accumulator `root`, and the root it advances to. It carries:

  * `spine`      — the sorted key set the root commits to (the ghost the openings ride against);
  * `commitsOld` — the realizable `root ↔ spine` binding (the single named Poseidon2/`Compress8CR`
                   floor; a HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom);
  * `gap` + `gapValid` — the predecessor/successor bracketing NON-MEMBERSHIP open for `nf`
                   (`GapOpen8`, the deployed `insert_witness`'s non-membership leg);
  * `newRoot` + `commitsNew` — the AFTER root binds `sortedInsert nf spine` (the fresh-key splice,
                   the deployed insert's after-membership leg).

State holds ONLY `root`; the whole set never crosses the wire. Non-membership of `nf` over `root` is
DERIVED from the witness (`witness_fresh`), not assumed — so a valid witness genuinely proves `nf` was
absent. -/

/-- **`present_no_witness` — THE SAFETY KEYSTONE (design §4(c)/(a)).** A key already committed by
`root` admits NO valid non-membership + insert witness: the accumulator gate is fail-closed for a
present key. This is the obligation the `List Nat` model got for free (the set was trusted state) and
the accumulator EARNS, because the witness is now adversary-supplied — a forged non-membership for a
present key would be a `GapOpen8` whose ordering contradicts `nf`'s presence (`excludesSpine`,
unconditional) OR a Poseidon2 collision opening a different spine than `root` commits (the single
`SpineCommits8`/`Compress8CR` floor). No new trust. -/

/-! ## §3 — the executable spend step + (b) the insert is faithful. -/

/-- **`spendNullifierRoot` — the accumulator double-spend step (fail-closed by witness scarcity).**
Given a valid `NfAccWitness` against the committed `nullifierRoot`, advance the root to the witness's
after-root. The O(1) work: verify the proof (the witness), swap the root — no set crosses the wire.
The fail-closed rejection of a double-spend is NOT a scan: it is the ABSENCE of any valid witness for
a present key (`present_no_witness`) — the STARK cannot be produced. -/

/-- **`spend_inserts_root` — THE INSERT IS FAITHFUL (design §4(b)).** A committed spend advances
`nullifierRoot` so that `nf` is now PRESENT in the new committed set — the `y = nf` disjunct of
`update_sound8`. So a SUBSEQUENT spend of the same `nf` is refused by `present_no_witness` (the
composed anti-replay, `spend_then_no_rewitness`). -/

/-- **`spend_then_no_rewitness` — THE COMPOSED ANTI-REPLAY.** After a committed spend of `nf`, the
resulting `nullifierRoot` commits `nf`, so NO valid witness exists for a second spend of the same
`nf`: double-spend is impossible. -/

/-- **`no_double_spend_root` — the double-spend gate in state terms.** A nullifier already committed
by `s.nullifierRoot` (already spent) admits NO valid spend witness. The `List Nat`
`note_no_double_spend` (`nf ∈ k.nullifiers → noteSpendNullifier k nf = none`) read over the root:
`nf` present ⇒ the witness-verifying step has no input ⇒ fail-closed. -/

/-! ## §4 — the REVOCATION dual (same accumulator, opposite gate polarity). -/

/-- **`revocationGateRootOK` — the revocation leg over the root.** The gate PASSES iff a valid
non-membership witness for `credNul` exists against the committed `revokedRoot` (the dual of the
`List.contains` read `!(s.kernel.revoked.contains na.credNul)`): pass ⟺ the credential's nullifier is
provably ABSENT from the revoked set. -/

credential whose nullifier sits in the COMMITTED revocation accumulator admits NO non-membership
witness ⇒ the gate's non-membership leg CANNOT pass ⇒ the credential is rejected. Non-vacuous by the
same `present_no_witness` argument: presence in `revokedRoot` is adversary-uncontrollable, so a
revoked credential cannot forge its way past no matter how valid its signature. -/

/-! ## §NON-VACUITY — the accept relation is load-bearing (witness TRUE and FALSE). -/

/-- **TRUE pole** — the accept relation is INHABITABLE: given the realizable spine↔root bindings for
the empty tree and its single-key successor (exactly what the deployed `compute_canonical_heap_root_8`
provides), a fresh spend HAS a witness (the `empty` gap trivially covers the empty spine). So
`present_no_witness`/`IsEmpty` is genuinely two-valued — the safety theorem is NOT laundering a
categorically-empty type. -/
