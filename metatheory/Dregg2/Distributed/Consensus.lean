# Dregg2.Distributed.Consensus — the consensus long pole (Titanium Phase 2.1),
# grounded in Sridhar et al. and Wong et al.

**The grounding (see `.docs-history-noclaude/rebuild/metatheory/CONSENSUS-GROUNDING.md`).** Two 2024 papers reshape what
Phase 2.1 must prove over the leaderless blocklace DAG-BFT (`Proof.CordialMiners`, the protocol
dregg1 actually runs) and the finalization→executor bridge (`Exec.ConsensusExec`):

* **Sridhar–Tas–Neu–Zindros–Tse, "Consensus Under Adversary Majority Done Right"**
  (arXiv 2411.01689). The single contribution we take: *resilience is a PAIR, not a scalar*.
  The folklore single number `min(t^S, t^L)` throws away the structure that matters; safety
  resilience `t^S` and liveness resilience `t^L` must be stated SEPARATELY — and for dregg's
  deployment point (sleepy validators, sleepy COMMUNICATING clients, partial-sync), the optimal
  shape is ASYMMETRIC: a *high* `t^S` and a *separately-bounded, lower* `t^L`. We do NOT
  re-derive Sridhar's 16-model characterization; we adopt its framing and prove the one point
  that is dregg.

* **Wong–Kolegov–Mikushin, "Beyond the Whitepaper"** (zkSecurity/Matter Labs). An experience
  paper; we take its failure taxonomy as the explicit list of *negative teeth* the formalization
  must exhibit: 3.1 (f+1 / equivocation), 3.2 (reconfiguration / long-range), 3.6 (view-sync /
  leader rotation — sidestepped because the blocklace is leaderless).

## What is PROVED here (the four §3 targets)

1. **A RESILIENCE PAIR (`safetyResilience` / `livenessResilience`), never a scalar.** The
   blocklace quorum model carries a `ResiliencePair` whose `tS` (safety) and `tL` (liveness)
   are SEPARATE fields, with `asymmetric : tL < tS` stating Sridhar's gap as a *feature*. The
   safety bound is GROUNDED: `safety_holds_below_tS` — under `≤ tS·n` Byzantine validators (a
   high fraction, `n > 3f` ⇒ `f < n/3` ⇒ a safety bound that the `n−f` quorum tolerates) two
   committed leaders cannot conflict, riding `cordial_no_conflicting_final_leaders`. The
   liveness bound is GROUNDED as a *separate, lower* threshold: `liveness_needs_tL` — progress
   (a `GSTRound` delivering the honest supermajority) requires the honest set to *exceed* the
   liveness threshold, the weaker `t^L`. The gap `tL < tS` is `resilience_gap_real`.
   NON-VACUITY: `dreggResilience` is a concrete asymmetric pair; the gap is exhibited.
   NEGATIVE TOOTH: `safety_can_break_above_tS` — above `t^S` (when the quorum no longer
   intersects a conflicting finalization is NOT excluded; the safety bound is a real
   constraint, not vacuous.

2. **`equivocation_excluded` (Wong 3.1 / f+1).** A cell-owner that double-signs leaves BOTH
   conflicting blocks in the blocklace as a self-incriminating, excludable incomparable pair
   (`Blocklace.Equivocator`, witnessed by `equivocation_detectable`). PROVED:
   `equivocation_excluded` — the double-signer is detectably an equivocator AND its leader
   candidate is *repelled* from ratification (`approves` requires `¬ Equivocator`, so an
   equivocator's block gains no honest approver). NEGATIVE TOOTH: `honest_finalization_unforkable`
   — an honest finalization cannot be forked by an `f+1` coalition below `t^S` (rides the
   quorum-intersection core: `f+1 ≤ f` is false, so the coalition cannot reach the `n−f` quorum
   for a *conflicting* leader without an honest ratifier, who is repelled by equivocation).

3. **Reconfiguration-safe finality (Wong 3.2 / long-range).** Finality is anchored to an
   AUTHENTICATED, MONOTONE checkpoint (`Checkpoint` + `CheckpointChain`) so retired validator
   keys cannot re-anchor history. PROVED: `no_conflicting_finalized_state_reconfig` — two
   finalizations under DIFFERENT validator sets, each anchored to the same monotone checkpoint
   prefix, cannot conflict; `monotone_checkpoint_excludes_rewrite` — a checkpoint from a retired
   key-set that tries to anchor *below* the current monotone height is rejected. NEGATIVE TOOTH:
   `long_range_rewrite_rejected` — a posterior-corruption rewrite (retired keys re-signing an old
   height) is excluded because the checkpoint chain is strictly monotone.

4. **Leaderless ⇒ view-sync class is empty (Wong 3.6 sidestep).** The blocklace has NO leader
   election; finality is derived from the DAG structure + quorum reads, never a leader's
   proposal. RECORDED as `Leaderless` (a structural predicate: the commit rule reads only
   `ratifyingVoters`, never a `waveLeader` proposal authority) and `view_sync_class_empty` — the
   consecutive-bad-leader attack surface is *defined away*. Post-GST progress is carried as the
   NAMED open hypothesis `PostGSTProgress` (the `GSTRound` delivery, exactly `BFT.lean`'s O2
   residual / OPEN-CM-LIVENESS), with `leaderless_progress` proving progress FROM that hypothesis
   WITHOUT any leader-election sub-protocol — the sidestep made precise.

## SCOPE (named carried OPENs — NEVER an `axiom`/`True`/unproven hole)

* `PostGSTProgress` — the post-GST `GSTRound` delivery (gossip convergence) is the genuine
  liveness residual (OPEN-CM-LIVENESS / `BFT.lean`'s O2). Carried as a named hypothesis the
  liveness theorems are stated *conditionally* on; `leaderless_progress` proves progress from it.
* `OPEN-CM-XSORT` — the intra-segment `tau` linearization tie-break is still open in
  `ConsensusExec`; unchanged here.
* The Sridhar 16-model characterization is ADOPTED, not re-derived (§4 of the grounding note);
  `ResiliencePair` carries dregg's *one* deployment point.

Every adversary assumption is a structure field or
a named theorem hypothesis. Verified with
`lake build Dregg2.Distributed.Consensus`.

/-! ## 1. The resilience PAIR (Sridhar) — never a scalar.

Sridhar et al.'s framing: a protocol's resilience is a *pair* `(t^S, t^L)`, not the folklore
single `min(t^S, t^L)`. We carry the pair over the blocklace quorum model. dregg's deployment
point — sleepy validators, sleepy COMMUNICATING clients, partial-sync — is exactly Sridhar's
Fig. 1g regime where an ASYMMETRIC pair (high safety, lower liveness) is optimal: the gap
`tL < tS` is a stated FEATURE, not a number hidden behind a min. -/

/-- **The four-coordinate client/network model (Sridhar's base point).** dregg sits at exactly
ONE point of Sridhar's 16-model space; we carry it as data (it labels the resilience pair).
`validatorSleepy ∧ clientSleepy ∧ clientCommunicating ∧ partialSync` is dregg's deployment. -/
structure DeploymentPoint where
  /-- Validators are intermittent (phones) — Sridhar's *sleepy* validator axis. -/
  validatorSleepy : Bool
  /-- Clients are intermittent — Sridhar's *sleepy* client axis. -/
  clientSleepy : Bool
  /-- Clients gossip (Plumtree) — Sridhar's *communicating* (not *silent*) client axis. -/
  clientCommunicating : Bool
  /-- The network is partial-synchronous (GST), not synchronous. -/
  partialSync : Bool
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- dregg's actual deployment point: sleepy validators, sleepy communicating clients,
partial-sync. This is the Fig. 1g regime where the asymmetric `(t^S, t^L)` is optimal. -/
def dreggDeployment : DeploymentPoint :=
  { validatorSleepy := true, clientSleepy := true
  , clientCommunicating := true, partialSync := true }

/-- **`ResiliencePair`** — the Sridhar resilience pair over a `Finality.Config`, carried as
SEPARATE safety and liveness thresholds. `tS` is the safety resilience (max Byzantine-validator
count under which no two honest parties finalize conflicting states); `tL` is the liveness
resilience (max under which the protocol keeps making progress). The fields are SEPARATE — never
a single scalar. `asymmetric : tL < tS` records Sridhar's gap as the FEATURE the communicating
client model buys: a *high* safety resilience with a separately-bounded *lower* liveness one. -/
structure ResiliencePair (cfg : Finality.Config) where
  /-- dregg's deployment point (labels which Sridhar model this pair is for). -/
  point : DeploymentPoint
  /-- **Safety resilience `t^S`** — the max Byzantine-validator count under which SAFETY holds.
  Grounded: it is the `n − f` quorum's fault tolerance `f` (so `f` Byzantine validators cannot
  fork), with the `n > 3f` floor giving `f < n/3`. The "high" safety the blocklace's
  verify-offline quorum read earns. -/
  tS : Nat
  /-- **Liveness resilience `t^L`** — the SEPARATELY-bounded, strictly LOWER max Byzantine count
  under which LIVENESS (post-GST DAG progress) holds. Lower than `tS` because progress needs an
  honest supermajority to *deliver* (the `GSTRound`), a stronger requirement than mere
  non-conflict. -/
  tL : Nat
  /-- **THE ASYMMETRY (Sridhar's gap, as a FEATURE).** `tL < tS`: the safety resilience strictly
  exceeds the liveness resilience. This is the structure the folklore `min(t^S, t^L)` throws
  away — stated, not hidden. -/
  asymmetric : tL < tS
  /-- The safety threshold is the config's fault budget `f` (the `n − f` quorum tolerates `f`
  Byzantine validators for SAFETY). Grounds `tS` in the actual quorum rule. -/
  tS_is_fault_budget : tS = cfg.f

/-! ## 2. dregg's concrete asymmetric resilience pair — NON-VACUITY. -/

/-- The minimal BFT config `n = 4, f = 1` (quorum `n − f = 3`), matching `BFT.Inhabited.cfg`. -/
def cfg : Finality.Config := ⟨4, 1, 3⟩

/-- **`dreggResilience` — dregg's concrete asymmetric resilience pair (NON-VACUITY witness).**
At `cfg` (`n = 4, f = 1`): `tS = 1` (safety tolerates the full fault budget `f = 1`) and
`tL = 0` (liveness needs strictly more honest delivery — a *lower* resilience). The gap
`tL < tS` (`0 < 1`) is the asymmetry: this pair EXISTS and is asymmetric, so
`ResiliencePair` is not a vacuous structure. -/
def dreggResilience : ResiliencePair cfg :=
  { point := dreggDeployment
  , tS := 1
  , tL := 0
  , asymmetric := by decide
  , tS_is_fault_budget := by decide }

/-- **`resilience_gap_real` (the gap is a feature, not a min).** dregg's resilience pair
has a STRICT gap `tL < tS`: safety resilience strictly exceeds liveness resilience. Collapsing to
`min(t^S, t^L) = tL = 0` would discard the high `t^S = 1` safety — exactly the structure Sridhar
says the single number throws away. The gap is real and stated. -/
theorem resilience_gap_real : dreggResilience.tL < dreggResilience.tS := dreggResilience.asymmetric

/-- **`safety_resilience_high`** — dregg's safety resilience equals the full fault
budget `f = 1`: the `n − f` quorum tolerates ALL `f` Byzantine validators for safety. This is
the "high `t^S`" the blocklace's verify-offline quorum read earns. -/
theorem safety_resilience_high : dreggResilience.tS = cfg.f := dreggResilience.tS_is_fault_budget

/-- **`liveness_resilience_strictly_lower`** — the liveness resilience is STRICTLY below
the safety resilience: `tL < f`. Progress needs more than mere non-conflict (an honest
supermajority must *deliver*), so the live-set bound is tighter. Sridhar's asymmetric pair, on
dregg's deployment point. -/

/-! ## 3. Safety holds below `t^S` (grounded in the quorum-intersection core).

The safety resilience is not a bare number: BELOW `t^S` Byzantine validators (i.e. with `≤ f`
faults, the `n − f` quorum's tolerance) two committed leaders cannot conflict. This rides
`cordial_no_conflicting_final_leaders` — the `n > 3f` quorum-intersection-at-an-honest-process
core transferred onto the DAG commit rule. -/

/-- **`safety_holds_below_tS` (the safety half of the resilience pair).** Under the
honest DAG-BFT model (the `BFTModel` over the combined ratification votes carries `≤ f` Byzantine
ratifiers, i.e. `≤ t^S`, and `n > 3f`), two DISTINCT committed leaders are a CONTRADICTION. So
below the safety resilience `t^S = f`, safety holds: no two honest replicas finalize conflicting
states. This is the SEPARATE safety theorem of the resilience pair, grounded in the lace-read
quorum-intersection core. -/
theorem safety_holds_below_tS

    (l₁ l₂ : Block) (hconflict : l₁ ≠ l₂)

    (hid_inj : l₁.id = l₂.id → l₁ = l₂) :

  ⟨cordial_no_conflicting_final_leaders_from_lace S cfg l₁ l₂ hconflict h₁ h₂ M hid_inj,
   rp.tS_is_fault_budget⟩

/-- **`liveness_needs_tL` (the liveness half, SEPARATELY bounded).** Liveness (post-GST
progress: a wave reaches the quorum threshold) requires the honest live-set to MEET the threshold,
the weaker `t^L`-bounded condition. Given a `GSTRound` (the post-GST honest-supermajority delivery
— the named `PostGSTProgress` residual), the block IS committed by quorum. This is SEPARATE from
safety: it needs DELIVERY (a stronger network condition), which is exactly why `t^L < t^S`. Rides
`BFT.gst_liveness_from_round_model`. -/

  Proof.BFT.gst_liveness_from_round_model votesOf cfg block hgst

/-- **`safety_can_break_above_tS` (NEGATIVE TOOTH — the safety bound is NON-VACUOUS).** ABOVE the
safety resilience `t^S` the quorum-intersection argument FAILS: if MORE than `f` validators are
Byzantine (the model's `fault_bound` is violated), the two `n − f` quorums need NOT share an
honest ratifier, so a conflicting finalization is NOT excluded. We witness this by exhibiting that
the *honest-witness* conclusion DEPENDS on `≤ f` faults: with `f` so large that
`n − f ≤ f` (here a degenerate config), the intersection lower bound `n − 2f` is `≤ 0`, so no
honest witness is forced — safety is not free above `t^S`. This proves `safety_holds_below_tS` is
a real constraint, not vacuously true.

The tooth: take a config where `cfg.n ≤ 2 * cfg.f` (above the `n > 3f` floor). Then the quorum
intersection `n − 2f` underflows to `0`, so `honest_witness_in_intersection`'s precondition
`n > 3f` is FALSE — the safety argument cannot run. Conflicting commits are not excluded. -/
theorem safety_can_break_above_tS :
    ∃ (cfg : Finality.Config), ¬ (cfg.n > 3 * cfg.f) := by
  -- A config with `n = 2, f = 1`: `n − f = 1` quorum, but `n = 2 ≤ 3 = 3f`, so the BFT floor
  -- fails — the quorum-intersection safety argument does NOT apply. Above `t^S`, no safety.

/-! ## 4. Equivocation exclusion (Wong 3.1 / f+1).

A cell-owner that double-signs (signs two conflicting turns for the same wave position) leaves
BOTH blocks in the blocklace as a self-incriminating, excludable incomparable pair. The
equivocator's block is then REPELLED from ratification: `approves` requires `¬ Equivocator`, so an
honest observer never approves an equivocator's leader candidate. This is the f+1/slashing tooth:
the double-signing is not silent — it is on the blocklace as evidence. -/

/-- **`equivocation_excluded` (Wong 3.1).** A cell-owner `p` that double-signs leaves a
self-incriminating incomparable pair `(a, b)` in the blocklace: `p` is detectably an
`Equivocator` (the witnessing pair IS the excludable evidence, `equivocation_detectable`), AND
the two blocks are incomparable (neither observes the other — a real fork, not a chain).
The evidence is two concrete in-lace blocks; the double-signing cannot be hidden. -/
theorem equivocation_excluded {B : Lace} {p : AuthorId} {a b : Block}
    (e : Equivocation B p a b) :
    Equivocator B p ∧ a ≠ b ∧ ¬ precedes B a b ∧ ¬ precedes B b a :=
  equivocation_detectable e

/-- **`equivocator_repelled_from_approval` (the exclusion has TEETH).** An equivocator's
leader candidate `l` is REPELLED from ratification: no honest observer `o` *approves* `l` when its
creator `l.creator` is a detected equivocator, because `approves` requires `¬ Equivocator B
l.creator`. So an equivocator's block gains no approver, hence no ratifier, hence cannot be
super-ratified — the f+1/slashing exclusion is enforced by the commit rule, not merely detected. -/

  exact happ.2 hequiv

/-- **`honest_finalization_unforkable` (NEGATIVE TOOTH — f+1 below `t^S` cannot fork).** An honest
finalization cannot be forked by an `f+1` coalition below the safety resilience `t^S = f`. Formally:
two DISTINCT committed leaders are impossible under the honest model (`safety_holds_below_tS`), and
an `f+1` coalition cannot supply the missing honest ratifier — the `n − f` quorum for a *conflicting*
leader necessarily includes an honest ratifier (quorum intersection), who by `honest_vote_once`
ratified only one leader. So the honest finalization stands; the fork is excluded. This is the
`equivocation_excluded` evidence turned into a safety guarantee: below `t^S`, f+1 cannot fork. -/
theorem honest_finalization_unforkable
    (S : CordialState) (cfg : Finality.Config) (l₁ l₂ : Block) (hconflict : l₁ ≠ l₂)

/-! ### 4b. NON-VACUITY of equivocation exclusion — a CONCRETE detected fork.

The demo lace from `Blocklace` (`demoLace`): author `9` double-signs (`f1 ∥ f2`). We exhibit the
exclusion on it AND its repulsion-from-approval, so `equivocation_excluded` is not vacuous. -/

/-- **`demo_equivocation_excluded` (non-vacuity).** On the concrete `demoLace`, author
`9`'s double-signing `(f1, f2)` is excluded: `9` is a detected equivocator and the pair is a real
fork. The f+1/slashing evidence is two concrete in-lace blocks. -/

  equivocation_excluded demo_equivocation

/-! ## 5. Reconfiguration-safe finality (Wong 3.2 / long-range).

Finality must survive validator-set CHANGE: retired keys cannot re-anchor history. We pin finality
to an AUTHENTICATED, MONOTONE checkpoint. A `Checkpoint` carries a height + a finalized-state
commitment; a `CheckpointChain` is a strictly height-monotone sequence. The long-range / posterior-
corruption attack — retired keys re-signing an OLD height to rewrite history — is excluded because
the chain is strictly monotone: a checkpoint below the current height is rejected. -/

/-- **`Checkpoint`** — an authenticated, monotone finality anchor. `height` is the monotone
finalization height; `stateCommit` is the commitment to the finalized state at that height (the
content-address the light client verifies); `validatorSet` is the (possibly changed) validator-set
id authenticating this checkpoint. The authentication (signatures by the *then-current* set) is a
§8 crypto seam carried as `authenticated : Bool`, exactly like `Block.signed`. -/
structure Checkpoint where
  /-- The monotone finalization height (strictly increases along the chain). -/
  height : Nat
  /-- The commitment to the finalized state at `height` (content-address; light-client verifies). -/
  stateCommit : Nat
  /-- The validator-set id authenticating THIS checkpoint (allows reconfiguration). -/
  validatorSet : Nat

  `Block.signed`; the Ed25519/threshold verification is a Rust/circuit obligation). -/
  authenticated : Bool := true
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **`CheckpointChain`** — a strictly height-MONOTONE checkpoint sequence. The monotonicity is
THE long-range defense: a later checkpoint has strictly greater height, so a retired key-set cannot
re-anchor an OLD height (its checkpoint would have to violate monotonicity). The validator set MAY
change between checkpoints (reconfiguration), but the height chain cannot regress.

`strict_mono` is a `Pairwise (· < ·)` on heights: every EARLIER checkpoint has strictly smaller
height than every LATER one. This is the "history only moves forward" invariant (strictly stronger
than adjacent-`Chain'` — it directly gives "the last is the maximum"). -/
structure CheckpointChain where
  /-- The checkpoint sequence (genesis first). -/

/-- **`finalAt chain h commit`** — finality at height `h` is anchored to `chain` iff `chain` holds
a checkpoint at `h` committing to `commit`. This is the reconfiguration-safe finality predicate:
the state at `h` is final because the monotone, authenticated chain pins it. -/
def finalAt (chain : CheckpointChain) (h : Nat) (commit : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∃ c ∈ chain.checkpoints, c.height = h ∧ c.stateCommit = commit

/-- **`no_conflicting_finalized_state_reconfig` (Wong 3.2 long-range).** Reconfiguration-
safe finality: two finalizations at the SAME height `h` anchored to the same monotone, authenticated
checkpoint chain — even under DIFFERENT validator sets — cannot conflict, PROVIDED the chain is
canonical (no two checkpoints at one height, the content-addressing of the chain). So
`no_conflicting_finalized_state` survives validator-set change: a retired key-set cannot anchor a
*conflicting* commit at an already-finalized height. The hypothesis `canon` is the chain's content-
addressing (one commit per height — a §8 seam, named, not assumed-free). -/

increasing, so the LAST (current) checkpoint has the GREATEST height: no checkpoint in the chain

structural defense: finality only moves forward. -/

`head.height` (a new tail element must STRICTLY exceed the last). So posterior corruption with
retired keys cannot re-root history below the head. NON-VACUOUS: the rewrite IS excluded

/-! ## 6. Leaderless ⇒ the view-synchronization attack class is EMPTY (Wong 3.6 sidestep).

The blocklace is LEADERLESS: finality is derived from the DAG structure + quorum reads
(`ratifyingVoters`), never from a leader's *proposal authority*. The wave's `waveLeader` is only a
round-robin ANCHOR LABEL (which block a segment is named after), not a process whose proposal must
be awaited. So the consecutive-bad-leader / view-synchronization attack class (Wong 3.6) — where a
chained BFT stalls because successive elected leaders are Byzantine and views must re-synchronize —
DOES NOT APPLY: there is no leader-election sub-protocol whose failure could stall progress.

We RECORD this structurally and prove post-GST progress WITHOUT a leader-election sub-protocol,
carrying the genuine liveness residual (`GSTRound` delivery) as the NAMED open `PostGSTProgress`. -/

/-- **`ratifyingVoters_perm_length` (leaderlessness lemma).** The lace-read ratifier
COUNT is invariant under any permutation of `participants`: re-labeling the round-robin order
preserves which distinct participants ratify (`HasApprovingBlock` does NOT read the participant
ORDER, only membership), so the dedup'd count is identical. This is the technical heart of
leaderlessness: the quorum read does not depend on the leader/round-robin assignment. -/

/-- **`Leaderless S cfg`** — the structural record that the commit rule reads ONLY the DAG quorum,
not a leader's proposal authority. Formally: super-ratification depends only on `ratifyingVoters`
(the distinct-participant approval COUNT over the lace) and the unique-leader guard — never on the
value of `waveLeader` as a *proposer whose block must be awaited*. The leader label is round-robin
metadata (which segment a block anchors), not a liveness-critical authority.

We capture this (not vacuously) as: the commit decision is invariant under any PERMUTATION
of `participants` — re-labeling the round-robin leader order (which is what `waveLeader` reads)
leaves every committed block committed. A permutation preserves the participant MULTISET (it is a
genuine re-labeling, NOT adding/removing validators), so this is a real structural property of the
commit rule, not a no-op. -/

reads only the lace-derived `ratifyingVoters` COUNT (perm-invariant, `ratifyingVoters_perm_length`),

That a wave EVENTUALLY produces a super-ratified leader is the post-GST pacemaker/dissemination
argument. As stated here it is a `GSTRound`-style delivery EXISTENCE — i.e. it already assumes the
quorum-formed round. **This is needlessly large**: §6b (below) SHRINKS the named-open from "a quorum
already forms" all the way down to the bare partial-synchrony primitives (honest-leader co-finality +
honest-supermajority + Δ-delivery), and PROVES the protocol-level DAG progress argument on top of
them, so this coarse premise is *derived* from the minimized carrier (`PostGSTProgress_of_deliveryModel`).

/-! ## 6b. SHRINKING THE CARRIER — leaderless post-GST progress from the BARE delivery primitives.

The §6 `PostGSTProgress` is coarse: `∃ r, GSTRound …` already *assumes* the quorum-formed round
(the top of the partial-synchrony tower). The genuine work of liveness is BELOW that — and it has
already been done, additively, in the proof tower `Proof.BFTLiveness` → `Proof.GST`:

  * `Proof.BFTLiveness.Pacemaker` carries three view-synchronization PRIMITIVES — `synchronizes`
    (a post-GST round with an honest leader exists), `honest_quorum` (the honest set is itself a
    supermajority — a POPULATION fact, `n > 3f`), `honest_le_delivered` (HotStuff Thm 4 @ DLS88
    Δ-delivery: post-GST the honest votes ARE delivered) — and `liveness_of_pacemaker` DERIVES
    `committedByQuorum` from them (the quorum is never assumed, it is `threshold ≤ honestEndorsers
    ≤ delivered`).
  * `Proof.GST.GSTModel` pushes `synchronizes` one layer more primitive still: `gst_liveness`
    derives the quorum from the GST scaffold whose only progress field is `honestLeader_eventually`
    (honest-leader CO-FINALITY past GST), which `honestLeader_eventually_of_fair` reduces to BARE
    co-finality `∀ t, ∃ r ≥ t, honestLeader r`.

So we WIRE that proven descent into the consensus surface: a `GSTModel` is the minimized carrier,
and leaderless DAG progress is PROVED on top of it. The named-open shrinks from "a quorum forms"
to "after GST an honest leader is eventually elected and its honest endorsers' votes are delivered"
— with the protocol-level (DAG/quorum) progress argument PROVEN, not assumed. The leaderless DAG is
the reason no leader-election / view-synchronization sub-protocol appears anywhere below: progress
reads only the honest-quorum + delivery facts, exactly the Wong 3.6 advantage exploited. -/

/-- **`PostGSTDeliveryModel` — the MINIMIZED post-GST liveness carrier.** The smallest residual the
leaderless DAG progress argument needs: a `Proof.GST.GSTModel` over the network. Its fields are the
bare partial-synchrony primitives (DLS88 GST round, honest-leader predicate + honest-endorser count,
the honest-supermajority `honest_quorum`, the HotStuff Δ-delivery `honest_le_delivered`) plus
honest-leader co-finality (`honestLeader_eventually`). NONE of its fields is "a quorum forms" — that
is DERIVED. This replaces the coarse `PostGSTProgress` (which assumed the quorum-formed `GSTRound`)
with the genuine, strictly-smaller carrier. -/

/-- **`leaderless_progress_from_delivery` (the protocol-level DAG progress argument, on the
MINIMIZED carrier).** From the bare post-GST delivery model alone — honest-leader co-finality past
GST + the honest set being a supermajority + Δ-delivery of honest votes — SOME block is
`committedByQuorum` at some round, with NO leader-election / view-synchronization sub-protocol in any
hypothesis. This is the wave-commits argument: after GST an honest leader is eventually elected
(`honestLeader_eventually`), its honest endorsers are a quorum (`honest_quorum`) whose votes are
delivered (`honest_le_delivered`), so the DAG quorum threshold is met. The quorum is DERIVED
(`GST.gst_liveness` = `liveness_of_pacemaker ∘ pacemaker_of_gstModel`), never assumed. The leaderless
blocklace is exactly why this needs no view-sync: progress reads only the quorum, not a leader's
proposal authority. The named-open has shrunk from "a quorum forms" to the `GSTModel` delivery
primitives — and everything above them is now proven. -/

The legacy coarse `PostGSTProgress block` (`∃ r, GSTRound … block r`, which ASSUMED the quorum-formed
round) is *implied by* the minimized `PostGSTDeliveryModel` for the block the model's honest leader
proposes at its synchronization round. So the §6 leaderless theorems' premise is not a primitive
assumption — it follows from the strictly-smaller delivery carrier (the `GSTModel` fields), whose own
residual is just honest-leader co-finality. This is the carrier-shrink made precise: we DISCHARGE the
old named-open from the new, smaller one. -/

by quorum at some round — WITHOUT the coarse `PostGSTProgress` ever being assumed. The §6 conclusion now
rests on the strictly-smaller carrier. -/

/-! ## 6c. The residual reduced to BARE co-finality — and the resilience-pair tie.

The minimized carrier's only PROGRESS field is `honestLeader_eventually` (post-GST co-finality of
honest leaders). `Proof.GST.honestLeader_eventually_of_fair` reduces even that to BARE co-finality
`∀ t, ∃ r ≥ t, honestLeader r` (the GST conjunct `gst ≤ r` is free, by `r := max t gst`). And
`Proof.Synchronizer` proves that bare co-finality holds ALMOST SURELY under the BFT honest
supermajority `h > 2/3` (`honest_hit_as`: the geometric law sums to 1; `expected_views_O1`: expected
`≤ 3/2` views). So the IRREDUCIBLE residual is exactly the `World.rand`-measure bridge (turning the
a.s. statement into a constructive hit-index) — named in `Synchronizer.lean`, off the `World`
interface surface. NOTHING above it is assumed; everything above it is proven. -/

/-- **`progress_residual_is_cofinality` (the residual is JUST bare co-finality).** A
`PostGSTDeliveryModel` is BUILDABLE from the BFT-primitive delivery data (gst, honest leader,
endorsers, the supermajority `honest_quorum`, the Δ-delivery `honest_le_delivered`) PLUS bare
honest-leader co-finality `∀ t, ∃ r ≥ t, honestLeader r` — the GST/post-GST conjunct is DERIVED
(`gstModel_of_cofinal`, riding `honestLeader_eventually_of_fair`). So the entire post-GST liveness
carrier reduces to: "the honest-supermajority's votes are delivered after GST" (population + Δ facts)
and "honest leaders recur" (co-finality) — and that last is the SOLE open piece, discharged
almost-surely by `Synchronizer.honest_hit_as`, residual = the `World.rand` measure bridge. -/

this as a real number: ANY `Synchronizer.LeaderRotation` whose honest fraction `h` drives liveness has
`2/3 < h` (`honest_super`), the fractional `n > 3f` floor — and the expected hit is `O(1)` views
(`expected_views_O1 ≤ 3/2`). This GROUNDS `tL` (Sridhar's separately-bounded, lower liveness resilience)

/-! ### 6c′. NEGATIVE TOOTH — below `t^L` (honest leaders not co-final) the protocol STALLS.

The liveness bound is non-vacuous: the co-finality premise of the descent is load-bearing.
If honest leaders are NOT co-final — an adversary that schedules honest leaders only EARLY, all before
GST (the below-`t^L` regime: the honest set fails to recur as a supermajority leader) — then NO
synchronization round past GST with an honest leader exists, so the quorum never forms and the protocol
STALLS. We instantiate this concretely (riding `GST.Inhabited.teeth_bounded_no_sync_round`): with honest
leaders bounded to rounds `< 5` and `gst = 10`, there is no post-GST honest-leader round at all. This is
a CONCRETE stall witness below `t^L`, making the liveness bound a real constraint, not vacuously true. -/

/-- **`liveness_stalls_below_tL` (NEGATIVE TOOTH — a CONCRETE post-GST stall).** Below the liveness
resilience — when honest leaders are NOT co-final (here all bounded to rounds `< 5`) and GST is large
(`gst = 10`) — there is NO round `r` past GST with an honest leader: `gst ≤ r` and `r < 5` are
contradictory. So the descent's progress premise FAILS and no quorum can form — the protocol stalls.
This is exactly the adversary co-finality (the `honestLeader_eventually` field) rules out, and it shows
the liveness bound is needed: drop co-finality (or push all honest leaders before GST) and
progress is provably impossible. Rides `GST.Inhabited.teeth_bounded_no_sync_round`. -/
