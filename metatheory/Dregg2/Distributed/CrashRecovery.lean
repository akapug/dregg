# Dregg2.Distributed.CrashRecovery — durable-commit-log recovery converges to the finalized
# ledger (checkpoint ⊕ overlay = full replay), the **recovery-side analogue of LaceMerge**.

**The gap this closes.** `Distributed.LaceMerge` proves that two replicas which merge the same set
of causally-closed blocks reach the SAME finalized executed state (`merge_convergence_to_state`).
It is about *agreement between replicas*. It says nothing about a SINGLE replica that **crashes and
recovers**: the running node persists its finalized ledger as a periodic full *checkpoint* plus a
per-turn durable *commit log* (`persist/src/commit_log.rs::commit_finalized_turn`,
`node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::execute_finalized_turn`). On restart it rebuilds the ledger as
`checkpoint ⊕ overlay`, where the overlay is the last-writer-wins post-state of every cell touched
by a committed turn ABOVE the checkpoint height (`commit_log.rs::cell_overlay_since`,
`node/src/state.rs` recovery). The correctness obligation — *the recovered ledger equals the ledger a
node would reach by replaying every finalized turn from genesis* — is THIS file.

A recovered node reaching the same finalized ledger IS LaceMerge convergence applied to recovery: the
durable log is a faithful, replayable transcript of the tau-finalized turn order, and recovery is a
join of (checkpoint-state, post-checkpoint-writes) that is order/grouping-independent for the same
reason the CRDT merge is — it is a fold of point updates whose observable is the final map.

## The model (matches the Rust recovery, as a pure function of the write stream).

* A ledger is a total map `Ledger := CellId → Option CellSt` (the `HashMap<CellId, Cell>` keyset+values
  of `dregg_cell::Ledger`, here keyed values; absence = `none`).
* A turn's durable record contributes a list of **writes** over the alphabet `Write = insert (CellId ×
  CellSt) | remove CellId`: the post-states of the cells it touched (`CommitRecord.touched_cells`,
  from `LedgerDelta.created ∪ updated`) AND the cells it ERASED (`CommitRecord.removed`, from
  `LedgerDelta.removed` — today `MakeSovereign`). Modelling writes as insert-ONLY (the old
  `List (CellId × CellSt)`) makes a removal unrepresentable, so the theorem would hold vacuously for a
  removing turn; the `remove` leg is what makes recovery a REAL catch (see `overlayInsertOnly` /
  `insert_only_overlay_resurrects`).
* `applyWrites` = `foldl applyWrite` point-update — an `insert` overwrites (`Ledger::insert_cell`), a
  `remove` erases (`Ledger::remove`); later write to the same id wins (`commit_log.rs`
  last-writer-wins, `state.rs::apply_overlay_op`).
* `replay base log` = fold every record's writes from `base` (the full deterministic ledger
  reconstruction = what a node that re-executed from genesis would hold).
* `checkpoint` at a cut = `replay genesis (log.take k)` (the persisted full snapshot is exactly the
  fold up to the checkpoint cut — `ledger_store.rs::checkpoint_ledger` serializes the live ledger).
* `overlay` = `cell_overlay_since`: the last-writer-wins post-state of cells written by records ABOVE
  the cut = the concatenated writes of `log.drop k`.
* `recover` = `applyWrites checkpoint overlay`.

THE theorem (`recover_eq_replay`): `recover genesis log k = replay genesis log` for any cut `k` —
**no torn state, no lost finalized turn, no double-apply**: the recovered ledger is byte-for-byte the
fully-replayed ledger, independent of WHERE the checkpoint fell. The crash-consistency corollaries:
* `recover_independent_of_checkpoint` — two different checkpoint cuts recover the SAME ledger
  (the checkpoint cadence is invisible to the recovered state; LaceMerge-style cut-independence).
* `lost_turn_changes_state` (anti-vacuity / NEG) — a recovery that DROPS a finalized record can yield
  a DIFFERENT ledger: the theorem is not vacuously true; persisting the full post-checkpoint log is
  load-bearing.

## SCOPE.

FAITHFUL (matches `commit_log.rs` / `state.rs` recovery as a pure function of the write stream):
* `applyWrites` = last-writer-wins point update over `Write = insert | remove` = `apply_overlay_op`
  (`Upsert` → `insert_cell` overwrite, `Remove` → `remove` erase).
* `checkpoint = replay genesis (take k)` = `checkpoint_ledger` snapshots the live fold.
* `overlay = concat writes of (drop k)` = `cell_overlay_since(checkpoint_height)` last-writer-wins,
  CARRYING removals (`CellOverlayOp::Remove`) — not insert-only.
* `recover = applyWrites checkpoint overlay` = `state.rs` (checkpoint ⊕ overlay).

SIMPLIFIED (a faithful PROJECTION, stated, not hidden):
* We model the cells' *values* abstractly (`CellSt`); the per-cell internal structure (balance,
  nonce, caps) is `RecordKernel`'s job and orthogonal — the recovery argument is about the MAP, which
  is what crash-consistency is. The convergence is therefore parametric in `CellSt`.
* The commit log's `block_executed_up_to` / `ledger_root` fields (the recovery cursor + the
  convergence commitment the Rust side asserts) are the *runtime* witnesses of THIS theorem; the
  `ledger_root` equality the node checks (`state.rs`) is exactly `recover_eq_replay` instantiated at
  the canonical-root hash, which we do not re-model (it is a function of the map).

## §B — RECORDS CARRY `(writes, burns)`: the forever-digest registry survives the crash cut.

The ledger model above covers the cell map. The node ALSO keeps **forever-digest registries**
(`persist/src/forever_digests.rs`): restart-surviving anti-replay carriers — a trustline draw
digest, a settle-unapplied compensation digest, a court resolved-evidence digest — burned exactly
once and refused for the rest of time. The Rust discipline is **durable-then-acknowledge**: the
digest is written in one committed redb transaction (fsync at the commit boundary) BEFORE the
in-memory insert is acknowledged, and the WHOLE set is reloaded at boot
(`load_forever_digests`). §B extends the record to `(writes, burns)` (`BRecord`), models the
durable registry as the append-only union of the log's burns (`registry`), and proves:

* `recoverB_eq_replayB` — the ledger convergence is untouched by the extension;
* `registry_cut_independent` — the registry reload sees no checkpoint cut (it is rebuilt from
  the WHOLE durable table, exactly `load_forever_digests`);
* **THE trustline forever-law lift** (`draw_replay_refused_across_crash`): a draw digest durably
  burned before the crash is REFUSED by the recovered trustline at ANY checkpoint cut — the Lean
  side of `forever_digests.rs`, composing `Trustline.draw_replay_refused` across recovery via
  `registry_burn_in_draws` (the reloaded registry is exactly the live carrier:
  `recovered_registry_faithful`, both inclusions).

### THE NAMED BOUNDARY (the post-commit/pre-ack window — read before trusting the theorem).

This model couples each turn's `writes` and `burns` in ONE durable record (the same-transaction
weld). The DEPLOYED node burns the digest in a SEPARATE redb transaction committed BEFORE the
in-memory ack: a crash between the digest commit and the turn's `CommitRecord` leaves the digest
durably burned while the turn is absent — the SAFE direction (the digest is refused after
recovery even though the draw never committed; no replay is ever ADMITTED). The CONVERSE — every
committed turn's digest is durably burned in the same transaction — is exactly the named node
closure "same-transaction burn weld" (.docs-history-noclaude/PERSISTENCE.md; HORIZONLOG `Node / runtime`). The
theorem's `hburn` hypothesis ranges over the durable registry, so it states exactly what
durable-then-acknowledge guarantees and no more.

.touched_cells`) but also ERASURES (`CommitRecord.removed`: a cell lifted out of the hosted set by
`MakeSovereign`). Modelling writes as insert-only (`List (CellId × CellSt)`) makes a removal
structurally unrepresentable — the recovered map would resurrect the removed cell as hosted, and the
convergence theorem would hold VACUOUSLY for a MakeSovereign turn (no write on either side). With
`Remove` in the alphabet the theorem is a REAL catch: an overlay that drops removals recovers a

A two-turn log where turn 1 REMOVES a cell (a `MakeSovereign(7)` tombstone) — the exact shape of the
Rust bug (`Ledger::make_sovereign`'s bare remove + insert-only `CommitRecord.touched_cells` /
`cell_overlay_since`). `demoRemLog` checkpoints AFTER turn 0 (`k = 1`, cell 7 held at 100), so the
removal lives in the overlay. The FAITHFUL recovery (`recover`, whose overlay carries the removal)
erases 7 — matching full replay. An INSERT-ONLY overlay (`overlayInsertOnly`, dropping the removal —
the bug) RESURRECTS 7 as hosted, recovering a ledger that DIFFERS from replay. This is why
`recover_eq_replay` is a real gate over the `Write = insert | remove` alphabet, not a vacuous
`P → P`: substitute `overlayInsertOnly` for `overlay` and it fails to close. -/

(`registry_burn_in_draws`), and `Trustline.draw_replay_refused` closes the gate. This is the Lean
side of `forever_digests.rs`'s durable-then-acknowledge contract — "forever" holds across a
process restart. (The post-commit/pre-ack window is the header's NAMED BOUNDARY: the model
couples burn and write in one record; the deployed separate-transaction burn is SAFE-direction
covered, and the converse weld is the named node closure.) -/

/-! ### §C non-vacuity (`#guard`-EXECUTED, both polarities).

A concrete schedule draws digest 5 (amount 3) at step 0 then settles 1; crash after 2 records.
The reloaded registry holds exactly the burn; recovery at every cut agrees; the burned digest is
REFUSED after recovery; a FRESH digest still draws (refusal is not fail-everything); and the NEG
witness — an AMNESIAC recovery that drops the registry (boot without `load_forever_digests`,
draws reset to `[]`) ADMITS the replay, so the durable table is load-bearing. -/
