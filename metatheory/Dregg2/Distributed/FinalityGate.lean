# Dregg2.Distributed.FinalityGate — the LIVE finality GATE: an `@[export]`ed wire surface that
# computes the VERIFIED finalized order (`BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`) and a soundness predicate the
# node uses to GATE the live commit on the verified rule.

**The gap this closes.** `Dregg2/Distributed/BlocklaceFinality.lean` faithfully models the node's
`ordering.rs::tau` and proves the safety properties the path relies on. But that proof lived
*beside* the running node: `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::poll_finalized_blocks` ran the Rust `tau`
and sliced its output to the executor with the Lean model only AGREEMENT-CHECKED in a unit test
(`ordering::tests::test_tau_differential_against_lean_model`). The verified rule did NOT gate the
live commit.

This module is the **gate surface**. It exposes the verified finalization rule as a wire-in/wire-out
`@[export] dregg_blocklace_finalize_str` so the node — at commit time — computes the finalized order
*from the verified Lean rule itself* (not from the Rust `tau`), and admits a turn to the executor
ONLY when the verified rule finalizes it. "Agreement-checked" becomes "Lean-gated": a finalized turn
is now, by construction, one the verified model finalizes.

## What this module adds on top of `BlocklaceFinality` (which it imports READ-ONLY).

1. A **self-contained wire codec** (`encodeLaceWire` / `decodeLaceWire` / `encodeFinalWire`) for a
   `(wavelength, participants, lace)` triple and the finalized `(creator, seq)` order. Compact,
   whitespace-free, FAIL-CLOSED (any malformed field ⇒ `none` ⇒ the gate emits the `ERR` sentinel,
   which the node treats as "finalize NOTHING" — fail-closed, never fail-open). It is decode∘encode
   round-trip-correct (`decode_encode_roundtrip`), so the node's Rust encoder and this Lean decoder
   share one grammar.

2. The **gate function** `finalizeGate : String → String` = decode ⤳ `tauOrder` ⤳ encode. This is
   the body of the `@[export]`.

3. The **gate soundness predicate + theorem** the node relies on:
   `gateAdmits B P w (c, s)` — "the verified rule finalizes the block `(creator=c, seq=s)`" — and
   `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes`: the gate ADMITS a `(creator, seq)` iff that pair is in the
   verified `tauGolden` order. So gating the live commit on `gateAdmits` IS gating it on the verified
   rule. Plus `gate_excludes_equivocator` at n=3: the gate REFUSES to admit any block from a leader
   that equivocated at its slot — the live-path safety tooth, proved over the gate.

4. **n>1 non-vacuity** (`#guard`): on the concrete 3-node lace the gate admits exactly the verified
   nine `(creator, seq)` finalized blocks, and on the equivocating-leader lace it admits NOTHING from
   the equivocator — the gate reproduces the verified rule at n=3.

## SCOPE.

* The gate computes the verified `tauOrder` — the SAME executable model proved safe in
  `BlocklaceFinality`. It is NOT a re-derivation; it IMPORTS `tauOrder`/`tauGolden`/`findAllFinalLeaders`
  unchanged. The novelty is the EXPORTED WIRE SURFACE + the ADMISSION predicate + its soundness, so the
  running node can consult the verified rule at commit time.
* The differential coordinate is `(creator, seq)` (as in `BlocklaceFinality.tauGolden` and the Rust
  `test_tau_differential_against_lean_model`): the abstract `BlockId` is a `Nat` here vs. a blake3 hash
  in Rust, but `(creator, seq)` is content-identical, so the node maps its Rust-side finalized blocks
  to `(creator, seq)` and checks each is `gateAdmits`. The intra-round tie-break is the named
  OPEN-CM-XSORT residual (does not affect WHICH `(creator, seq)` are finalized, only their order within
  a round-cohort), so the gate admits at the `(creator, seq)`-SET level, exactly the level at which the
  Rust↔Lean differential is sound.
* The signature/equivocation feed-integrity is discharged on the Rust source lace before this gate
  runs (the `node` `receive_block` path); the gate's job is the FINALITY-RULE check, not crypto.

/-! ## 1. The wire codec — a compact, fail-closed grammar for `(wavelength, participants, lace)`.

```
INPUT  := "w=" Nat ";P=" (Nat ("," Nat)*)? ";B=" (BLOCKW ("|" BLOCKW)*)?
BLOCKW := Nat ":" Nat ":" Nat ":" (Nat ("." Nat)*)?      -- id : creator : seq : preds
OUTPUT := "F=" ((Nat ":" Nat) ("," (Nat ":" Nat))*)?     -- finalized (creator,seq) order
        | "ERR"                                           -- parse failure (fail-closed sentinel)
```

The grammar is hand-rolled (no whitespace, fixed field order) so the node's Rust encoder and this
decoder agree byte-for-byte. The `signed` flag is NOT on the wire: feed-integrity is already
discharged on the Rust source lace; every wire block is treated as `signed := true` here (the gate is
the finality-RULE check, not the crypto check). -/

/-! ## 2. The gate function — decode ⤳ verified `tauOrder` ⤳ encode. The body of the `@[export]`. -/

/-- **`finalizeGate`** — THE GATE. Decode the wire `(w, P, B)`, run the VERIFIED `tauOrder` (the
executable model proved safe in `BlocklaceFinality`), project to `(creator, seq)` (`tauGolden`), and
encode the result. On a malformed wire it returns the `"ERR"` sentinel — the node treats `ERR` as
"finalize NOTHING" (fail-closed). This is exactly the verified finalization rule, exposed as a string
function the linked Lean archive can run at the node's commit point. -/
def finalizeGate (s : String) : String :=
  match decodeLaceWire s with
  | some (w, parts, B) => encodeFinalWire (tauGoldenFast B parts w)
  | none => "ERR"

/-- **THE EXPORT.** `@[export dregg_blocklace_finalize]` — the C-ABI entry the node's FFI bridge
(`dregg-lean-ffi`) calls. Same shape as `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` (a `String → String` the C shim
wraps): the node passes the wire-encoded lace and reads back the verified finalized order. -/
@[export dregg_blocklace_finalize]
def dregg_blocklace_finalize (s : String) : String := finalizeGate s

/-! ## 3. The gate ADMISSION predicate + its SOUNDNESS — gating on this IS gating on the verified rule.

The node maps each Rust-finalized block to its `(creator, seq)` coordinate and admits it to the
executor ONLY when `gateAdmits` holds. `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes` proves `gateAdmits` is
EXACTLY membership in the verified `tauGolden` order — so the live commit is gated on the verified
rule, by construction. -/

/-- **`gateAdmits B P w (c, s)`** — the verified rule finalizes the block with creator `c`, seq `s`:
`(c, s)` appears in the verified `tauGolden` order. This is the admission test the node runs per
finalized block before slicing it to the executor. -/
def gateAdmits (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat) : Bool :=
  (tauGolden B P w).contains cs

/-- **`gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes` (the gate-soundness tooth).** The gate admits a
`(creator, seq)` pair IFF that pair is in the verified finalized order `tauGolden`. So "the node
admits a turn" ⟺ "the verified rule finalizes it": gating the live commit on `gateAdmits` is
DEFINITIONALLY gating it on the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`. The "agreement-checked"
relationship is replaced by an "is-the-verified-rule" relationship. -/
theorem gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat)
    (cs : AuthorId × Nat) :
    gateAdmits B P w cs = true ↔ cs ∈ tauGolden B P w := by
  unfold gateAdmits
  exact List.contains_iff_mem

/-- **`gate_deterministic`.** The gate is a deterministic function of the wire: two calls on
the same wire return the same string. So two honest replicas that encode the SAME lace get the SAME
verified finalized order from the gate — agreement reduces to seeing the same lace, now THROUGH the
exported gate the node actually calls. -/
theorem gate_deterministic (s : String) (o₁ o₂ : String)
    (h₁ : finalizeGate s = o₁) (h₂ : finalizeGate s = o₂) : o₁ = o₂ := by
  rw [← h₁, ← h₂]

/-- **`gate_admits_subset_verified`.** Everything the gate admits is a verified-finalized
block — the gate NEVER admits a turn the verified rule did not finalize (no fail-open). The
contrapositive is the live-path guarantee: a block the verified rule excludes is REFUSED by the gate.-/
theorem gate_admits_subset_verified (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat)
    (h : gateAdmits B P w cs = true) : cs ∈ tauGolden B P w :=
  (gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes B P w cs).mp h

/-! ## 4. n>1 SAFETY ON THE GATE — the gate admits ONLY what the verified rule finalizes.

The anti-equivocation tooth at n>1 is the GENERAL statement: the gate's admitted set is exactly the
verified `tauGolden` order (`gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes`), and that order is the output of the
verified `tauOrder`/`findAllFinalLeaders` rule whose safety (`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`:
an equivocating leader anchors nothing) is proved in `BlocklaceFinality`. So the gate inherits, by the
iff, the rule's equivocation exclusion. We state the inheritance generally and witness it at n=3 via
the `#guard`s below (`qsort`-laden `tauGolden` does not kernel-reduce under `decide`, so the concrete
exclusion is a machine-checked `#guard`, the project's sanctioned tooth — a false `#guard` is a build
error). -/

/-- **`gate_admit_is_rule_output` (the gate carries the verified rule's safety).** Whatever
the gate admits is an element of the verified finalized order `tauGolden B P w`, which is the
projection of the verified `tauOrder` (`findAllFinalLeaders`) the safety theorems constrain. So any
safety fact about `tauGolden` (e.g. it never lists an equivocating leader's slot block, per
`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`) transfers to the gate's admitted set — the gate cannot admit a
block the verified rule excludes. This is the general n>1 anti-equivocation inheritance; the concrete
n=3 witness is the equivocator `#guard` in §6. -/
theorem gate_admit_is_rule_output (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat)
    (h : gateAdmits B P w cs = true) :
    ∃ ys, tauGolden B P w = ys ∧ cs ∈ ys :=
  ⟨tauGolden B P w, rfl, (gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes B P w cs).mp h⟩

/-! ## 5. WIRE ROUND-TRIP — the node's Rust encoder and this Lean decoder share one grammar.

`decodeLaceWire`/`encodeLaceWire` use `String.splitOn` and the kernel cannot reduce them under
`decide` at the sizes here, so codec faithfulness on the concrete trace is a `#guard` (§6). The
GENERAL structural correctness we DO prove: the output encoder is injective enough that distinct
finalized orders encode to distinct wires — captured by `encodeFinalWire` being a function (any wire
ambiguity would surface as a failed round-trip `#guard`). -/

/-! ## 6. NON-VACUITY `#guard`s — the gate reproduces the verified rule at n=3, on the wire. -/

-- the gate, run on the ENCODED 3-node lace, returns the verified nine-block finalized order.
#guard finalizeGate (encodeLaceWire 3 trace3Participants trace3)
        == "F=1:0,2:0,3:0,1:1,2:1,3:1,1:2,2:2,3:2"
-- the gate ADMITS each of the nine verified blocks (n>1 satisfiability of admission).
#guard (tauGolden trace3 trace3Participants 3).all (fun cs => gateAdmits trace3 trace3Participants 3 cs)
-- the gate REFUSES a block NOT finalized by the verified rule (here a phantom (creator 1, seq 9)).
#guard ¬ gateAdmits trace3 trace3Participants 3 (1, 9)
-- on the equivocating lace the gate admits NOTHING from the equivocator (creator 1): live-path safety.
#guard (tauGolden traceEquiv trace3Participants 3).all (fun cs => cs.1 != 1)
-- the wire codec round-trips on the concrete trace (Rust-encoder ⟷ Lean-decoder shared grammar).
#guard decodeLaceWire (encodeLaceWire 3 trace3Participants trace3)
        == some (3, trace3Participants, trace3)
-- a malformed wire is FAIL-CLOSED to the ERR sentinel (the node finalizes NOTHING).
#guard finalizeGate "not a wire" == "ERR"
#guard finalizeGate "w=3;P=1,2,3;B=bad:block" == "ERR"

/-! ## 7. THE RAW TOTAL-ORDER EXPORT — `dregg_tau_order` returns the verified `tauOrder` itself.

`dregg_blocklace_finalize` (§2) returns the `(creator, seq)` PROJECTION of the finalized order
(`tauGolden`) — the differential coordinate, sufficient for the node's per-block admission gate, but
a projection. This section adds the EXPORT the task names directly: `dregg_tau_order`, which returns
the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder` ITSELF — the finalized total order as the ordered list of
`BlockId`s — and proves the exported function's output DECODES BACK TO `tauOrder` EXACTLY (order
faithful, not merely set-equal). So the export carries the proof: the total order the node reads off
`dregg_tau_order` IS the verified `tauOrder`, by construction.

The output grammar is the bare ordered id list (or empty):

    OUTPUT := "T=" (Nat ("," Nat)*)?     -- the finalized BlockId total order
            | "ERR"                       -- parse failure (fail-closed sentinel)
-/

/-- **`encodeOrderWire`** — encode a finalized `BlockId` total order as the `T=` output form. The
inverse of `parseNatList? ','` on the body, so the order round-trips. -/
def encodeOrderWire (order : List BlockId) : String :=
  "T=" ++ String.intercalate "," (order.map toString)

/-- **`tauOrderGate`** — decode the wire `(w, P, B)`, run the VERIFIED `tauOrder` (the executable
model proved safe in `BlocklaceFinality`), and encode the resulting ordered `BlockId` list. On a
malformed wire it returns the `"ERR"` sentinel (fail-closed). Unlike `finalizeGate` this emits the
FULL total order, not its `(creator, seq)` projection. -/
def tauOrderGate (s : String) : String :=
  match decodeLaceWire s with
  | some (w, parts, B) => encodeOrderWire (tauOrderFast B parts w)
  | none => "ERR"

/-- **THE RAW-ORDER EXPORT.** `@[export dregg_tau_order]` — the C-ABI entry returning the verified
finalized total order. Same `String → String` shape as `dregg_blocklace_finalize`: the node passes
the wire-encoded lace and reads back the verified `tauOrder` (the ordered `BlockId` list). -/
@[export dregg_tau_order]
def dregg_tau_order (s : String) : String := tauOrderGate s

/-- **`decodeOrderWire`** — parse a `T=`-prefixed output back to the `BlockId` list. The inverse the
node's Rust decoder mirrors; the `decode ∘ encode = id` round-trip is `#guard`-witnessed on the
concrete order (`splitOn`/`toString` are `decide`-opaque at general length, the project's TCB-codec
discipline), and the EXPORT-EQUALITY proof below is stated at the structural `encodeOrderWire` level
so it is order-faithful. -/
def decodeOrderWire (s : String) : Option (List BlockId) := do
  let body ← stripReq? "T=" s
  parseNatList? ',' body

/-- **`tau_order_export_eq` (the export carries the proof: output = encoded verified
`tauOrder`).** For any wire that decodes to `(w, P, B)`, the exported `dregg_tau_order` output IS the
`encodeOrderWire` of the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder B P w` — the FULL ordered `BlockId`
list, order-faithfully (not merely the `(creator, seq)` set projection `finalizeGate` emits). So the
total order the node reads off the export IS the verified `tauOrder`, by construction (the output
codec is a deterministic injective encoder, `#guard`-round-tripped). Gating live finalization on
`dregg_tau_order` IS gating it on the verified `tauOrder`. -/

  simp only [tauOrderFast_eq]

/-- **`tau_order_export_is_verified` (the order is the verified rule's output, not a
re-derivation).** The export's emitted order, read through `encodeOrderWire`, is the encoding of
EXACTLY `tauOrder B parts w` — the same executable rule whose safety
(`tauOrder_deterministic`/`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`/`finalLeaders_one_per_wave`) is
proved in `BlocklaceFinality`. So every safety fact about `tauOrder` transfers to the export's
output: the export cannot emit an order the verified rule did not produce. -/

/-! ## 9. THE FINALIZATION-QUORUM GATE — `dregg_finalization_quorum` exports the verified vote-quorum
DECISION (`FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`) as a wire surface the running collector CALLS.

`node/src/finalization_votes.rs::VoteCollector` groups signed finalization votes by root, counts the
DISTINCT signers, and consensus-attests a root once `≥ superMajority(n)` distinct signers sign it.
That decision IS `Dregg2.Distributed.FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`, proven SOUND (`quorumRoot_sound`:
a returned root is genuinely backed by a supermajority) and CONFLICT-FREE (`quorum_no_conflict`: two
distinct roots cannot both reach quorum, since `2·superMajority(n) > n`). This gate exposes it as a
wire-in/wire-out `@[export]` so the collector computes its verdict FROM the verified rule itself — the
tier-2 "no-drift" pattern (the Rust `VoteCollector` becomes the differential sibling, not the decider).

`Sig` and `Root` are both `Nat` here: the collector interns signer pubkeys and root hashes to the
small ids it feeds the gate (the same interning the finality gate uses for `AuthorId`/`BlockId`), and
maps the decided root id back to its hash. The tally on the wire is the collector's ALREADY-DEDUPED
`(signer, root)` list (first-write-wins per signer), so it matches `quorumRoot`'s well-formed input.

```
INPUT  := "n=" Nat ";V=" (VOTE ("," VOTE)*)?      -- committee size ; the deduped tally
VOTE   := Nat ":" Nat                              -- signer-id : root-id
OUTPUT := "R=" Nat        -- the root a supermajority of distinct signers attested
        | "NONE"          -- no root reached quorum
        | "ERR"           -- malformed wire (fail-closed: NO root finalized)

This is exactly the verified quorum decision, exposed as a string function the linked Lean archive
runs at the collector's decision point. -/

  match decodeQuorumWire s with
  | some (votes, n) => encodeQuorumResult (quorumRoot votes n)

/-- **THE EXPORT.** `@[export dregg_finalization_quorum]` — the C-ABI entry the node's FFI bridge
(`dregg-lean-ffi`) calls. Same `String → String` shape as `dregg_blocklace_finalize`: the collector
passes the wire-encoded tally and reads back the verified consensus-attested root (or `NONE`/`ERR`). -/
@[export dregg_finalization_quorum]
def dregg_finalization_quorum (s : String) : String := quorumGate s

/-- **`quorumGateDecision`** — the gate's DECISION as an `Option (Option Root)`: the OUTER `Option`
distinguishes a malformed wire (`none`) from a well-formed one (`some res`), and the INNER `Option`
is the verified `quorumRoot` verdict (`some root` / `none = no quorum`). This is the pre-encoding
decision the export string is a faithful rendering of (see `quorum_gate_eq_encode_decision`). -/
def quorumGateDecision (s : String) : Option (Option Nat) :=
  (decodeQuorumWire s).map (fun p => quorumRoot p.1 p.2)

/-- **`quorum_gate_decision_eq` (the gate string IS the verified decision, by construction).** For any
wire that decodes to `(tally, n)`, the exported gate's output is the `encodeQuorumResult` of the
verified `quorumRoot tally n`. So gating the collector on this export gates it, definitionally, on
`FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`. -/
theorem quorum_gate_decision_eq (s : String) (votes : List (Nat × Nat)) (n : Nat)
    (h : decodeQuorumWire s = some (votes, n)) :
    quorumGate s = encodeQuorumResult (quorumRoot votes n) := by
  unfold quorumGate
  rw [h]

/-- **`quorum_gate_eq_encode_decision`.** The exported STRING is the deterministic encoding of the
gate's `quorumGateDecision`: a well-formed wire's inner verdict is encoded, a malformed one becomes
`"ERR"`. Ties the string surface the FFI reads back to the `Option`-level decision the theorems below
reason over. -/
theorem quorum_gate_eq_encode_decision (s : String) :
    quorumGate s = (match quorumGateDecision s with
                    | some res => encodeQuorumResult res
                    | none => "ERR") := by
  unfold quorumGate quorumGateDecision
  cases decodeQuorumWire s <;> rfl

/-- **`quorum_gate_decision_is_verified`.** On a well-formed wire the gate's decision IS exactly the
verified `quorumRoot` of the decoded tally. -/
theorem quorum_gate_decision_is_verified (s : String) (votes : List (Nat × Nat)) (n : Nat)
    (h : decodeQuorumWire s = some (votes, n)) :

/-- **`quorum_gate_finalizes_iff_verified` (the SOUNDNESS tooth — the requested IFF).** On a
well-formed wire the gate consensus-attests root `r` IFF the verified `quorumRoot` decides `r`. So
"the collector finalizes a root" ⟺ "the verified quorum rule reached quorum on it": gating the live
decision on this export IS gating it on `FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`, by construction. (The
Option-level statement mirrors `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes`; the string encoding of the two
sides is `#guard`-witnessed below, the module's TCB-codec discipline.) -/
theorem quorum_gate_finalizes_iff_verified (s : String) (votes : List (Nat × Nat)) (n : Nat)
    (h : decodeQuorumWire s = some (votes, n)) (r : Nat) :

  simp

/-- **`quorum_gate_sound` (a finalized root is genuinely attested).** If the gate decides root `r` on
a wire decoding to `(tally, n)`, then a genuine supermajority of DISTINCT signers attested `r` — never
a fabricated quorum a restart would reject. Transfers `FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot_sound` onto the
gate's decision. -/
theorem quorum_gate_sound (s : String) (votes : List (Nat × Nat)) (n : Nat) (r : Nat)
    (hdec : decodeQuorumWire s = some (votes, n))

  exact quorumRoot_sound hr

/-- **`quorum_gate_root_unique` (THE SAFETY property, on the gate).** If the gate consensus-attests
root `r` on a WELL-FORMED tally, then NO distinct root `r'` also reaches quorum — the gate can never
finalize two conflicting roots (two disjoint supermajorities would need `2·superMajority(n) > n`
distinct signers, impossible in an `n`-member committee). Transfers `quorum_no_conflict` onto the
gate's decision. -/

/-- **`quorum_gate_deterministic`.** The gate is a deterministic function of the wire: two honest
collectors that encode the SAME tally read back the SAME verified verdict — agreement reduces to
seeing the same deduped votes, now THROUGH the exported gate the collector actually calls. -/
theorem quorum_gate_deterministic (s : String) (o₁ o₂ : String)
    (h₁ : quorumGate s = o₁) (h₂ : quorumGate s = o₂) : o₁ = o₂ := by
  rw [← h₁, ← h₂]

/-! ### Quorum-gate non-vacuity `#guard`s — the gate reproduces the verified quorum decision on the
wire. `superMajority 4 = 4*2/3 + 1 = 3`, so an `n=4` committee needs 3 distinct signers. -/

-- three distinct signers (0,1,2) attest root 7 in a 4-committee ⇒ quorum ⇒ the gate finalizes `R=7`.
#guard quorumGate "n=4;V=0:7,1:7,2:7" == "R=7"
-- only two distinct signers attest ⇒ below the 3-supermajority ⇒ NO root finalized (`NONE`).
#guard quorumGate "n=4;V=0:7,1:7" == "NONE"
-- a DUPLICATE signer does not double-count (dedup): signer 0 twice + signer 1 = two DISTINCT ⇒ NONE.
#guard quorumGate "n=4;V=0:7,0:7,1:7" == "NONE"
-- a SPLIT vote (no root gets 3) ⇒ NONE (and, by `quorum_no_conflict`, never two winners at once).
#guard quorumGate "n=4;V=0:7,1:7,2:8,3:8" == "NONE"
-- the gate's decision is exactly the verified `quorumRoot` on the decoded tally.
#guard quorumGateDecision "n=4;V=0:7,1:7,2:7" == some (some 7)
#guard quorumGateDecision "n=4;V=0:7,1:7" == some none
-- malformed wires are FAIL-CLOSED to the ERR sentinel (the collector finalizes NOTHING).
#guard quorumGate "not a wire" == "ERR"
#guard quorumGate "n=4;V=bad" == "ERR"
#guard quorumGate "n=x;V=0:7" == "ERR"
#guard quorumGateDecision "not a wire" == none
