# Dregg2.Distributed.HistoryAggregation — the FOLD model under the IVC accumulator.

**What this is.** The whole-chain IVC accumulator (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs`) folds a
sequence of finalized-turn proofs into ONE recursive proof attesting "all turns `1..K` executed
correctly AND the finalized state root advanced correctly from genesis to final, in that order."
This module is the EXECUTABLE/DECLARATIVE model that fold is supposed to attest — stated over the
VERIFIED executor (`Exec.RecordKernel.recCexec`, the same machine `BlocklaceFinality.executeTau`
drives) and the GENUINE per-turn commitment the deployed chain folds: the ROTATED commit `chainedCommit`
(= `hash_many [d, iroot]`, `trace_rotated.rs`), whose first limb is the injective §8 kernel digest `d =
`Circuit.StateCommit.recStateCommit` (the full-state root the whole-turn triangle pins —
`whole_turn_circuit_pins_intent_fold`) and whose second limb is the receipt-log root `iroot`
(`logRoot`), so the folded commitment BINDS the receipt log — whole-history non-omission is real, not
just the single-step root face (`root_tooth_pins_log`, `logChained_of_verified`).

It is the *meaning* of the chain. `RecursiveAggregation.lean` adds the SNARK recursion layer on top:
it names the inner-proof-soundness + recursive-verifier-soundness hypotheses (the part you cannot
prove in Lean — plonky3/pickles FRI), and shows that, UNDER those named hypotheses, an aggregate
proof's validity is exactly `AggregateAttests` from this file — so a light client that checks only
the succinct aggregate learns the whole history is correct.

**The two binding facts modeled here** (the `TurnChainBindingAir` of `ivc_turn_chain.rs:188`):
  1. **Per-step correctness** — each fold step `(pre, turn, post)` is a GENUINE `recCexec` step
     (its `commits` field), so the step proof, when sound, attests the verified executor actually
     ran that turn.
  2. **The temporal tooth** — `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`): step `i`'s
     post-root is step `i+1`'s pre-root. Reorder / drop / insert ⇒ the chain breaks (UNSAT).

**The headline (`wellformed_attests_whole_history`):** a `WellFormedChain` from a genesis state
yields — for EVERY turn in the chain — a real `recCexec` step (the turn executed correctly per the
verified executor), the chain is correctly ordered (each post-root = next pre-root), and the whole
chain is a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis whose final state is the genuine fold of the history,
so `recChained_run_conserves` (no mint/burn over the entire history) applies.

/-! ## 0. The §8 state-commitment portal (the kernel-digest limb of the rotated per-turn commit).

`recStateCommit k t` is the injective full-state KERNEL commitment from the whole-turn triangle
(`StateCommit.lean:196`) — the FIRST limb (`d`) the deployed rotated per-turn commit `chainedCommit`
absorbs (the prover folds the rotated commit, not this limb alone; see `chainedCommit` below). It is
parametric in the Poseidon portal functions; we carry them as section variables exactly as
`StateCommit`/`WholeTurnTriangle` do, plus the collision-resistance carriers the binding lemmas need
(`compressInjective cmb` for the kernel-digest split, `compressNInjective compressN` for the OUTER
rotated sponge + the receipt-log root — both REALIZABLE Poseidon CR). -/

/-- **`stateRoot k t`** — the §8 KERNEL DIGEST `d`: the injective full-state commitment of kernel
`k` under turn-context `t` (`recStateCommit` with the portal fixed). This is the FIRST limb the
deployed rotated commit absorbs (`chainedCommit` below = `hash_many [d, iroot]`, `trace_rotated.rs`),
NOT the whole per-turn commitment any longer — it is blind to the receipt log (that is the point of
the §2 repair: the log is bound by the SECOND limb). It still serves as the empty-chain anchor (a
chain with no steps has no receipts to omit) and as the kernel-faithful core the rotated commit
refines (`recStateCommit_binds_kernel` recovers the whole kernel from this limb). -/

/-! ### The receipt-log root + the DEPLOYED ROTATED per-turn commitment (the §2 repair, canonical).

The deployed live chained commit is NOT the kernel-only `recStateCommit` — it is the ROTATED WIDE
commitment `state_commit = hash_many [d, iroot]` (`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs`, `B_IROOT`;
`turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:349` "iroot … absorbed INTO the v9 commitment, which the proof
binds"), where `d = recStateCommit … k t` is the kernel digest and `iroot` is the receipt-index root
over the turn's receipt log. We model it here so the per-turn commitment the IVC chain folds BINDS the
receipt log — making whole-history non-omission REAL, not just the single-step root face.

The receipt-index root is modeled as the CR sponge digest `compressN` of the receipt-felt list
(`logRoot`). This is the faithful in-layer stand-in for the deployed Poseidon2 receipt MMR root: both
are injective Poseidon2 commitments to the SAME receipt-felt list under the ONE CR floor
(`compressNInjective compressN = Poseidon2SpongeCR compressN`). The MMR's succinct-RANGE-opening
structure (`mroot`, `CommitBindsMMR`) lives DOWNSTREAM in `Lightclient/MMR` (which imports this
module); the aggregation model needs only the BINDING (omission-resistance), which the sponge digest
delivers identically. -/

/-- A single receipt felt — the deployed per-turn receipt commitment, modeled as the CR digest of the
turn's four fields `(actor, src, dst, amt)`. Injective in the turn (a receipt commits the whole turn,
`turnReceipt_injective`). -/

root `iroot = logRoot … st.log`. It STRICTLY REFINES `recStateCommit`: the kernel digest `d` is the
FIRST absorbed limb (so it still binds the WHOLE kernel via `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` — kernel
guarantees are PRESERVED, not weakened), AND it binds the receipt log via the SECOND limb (so
omission of any receipt at this turn moves the published commit). The roots the IVC chain folds
(`ChainStep.oldRoot/newRoot`) are this commitment. -/

/-! ## 1. One fold step — a finalized turn + the roots it advances.

The Rust `FinalizedTurn` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:100`) carries a whole-turn proof whose PI exposes
`(OLD_COMMIT, NEW_COMMIT)`. Here a `ChainStep` carries the pre-state chained record, the turn, and
the post-state chained record, together with the EXECUTOR WITNESS `recCexec pre turn = some post` —
so this is a real verified step, not an asserted one. Its roots are the GENUINE `stateRoot` of the
pre/post kernels. -/

/-- A single fold step: a genuine `recCexec` transition `(pre, turn) ↦ post`, plus the receipt logs
the chained state carries. Modeled directly over the verified executor so the step's roots are the
real commitments of states the executor reached — what an honest inner step proof, when
sound, attests. -/

  commits : recCexec pre turn = some post

receipt-log root). The Rust `old_root`. -/

/-- The step's post-state root — the DEPLOYED ROTATED commitment of the post-state (kernel digest +
receipt-log root). The Rust `new_root`. -/
def ChainStep.newRoot (s : ChainStep) : ℤ := chainedCommit CH RH cmb compress compressN s.post s.turn

/-! ## 2. The temporal tooth — `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`.

`TurnChainBindingAir` constraint 1 (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`): each step's `new_root` must be the
NEXT step's `old_root`. A reordered/dropped/inserted turn breaks this and is UNSAT. -/

/-- **`Continues s s'`** — the temporal tooth between adjacent steps: `s.newRoot = s'.oldRoot`
(`new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`). Its failure is the `TurnChainError::ChainBreak` rejection. -/

  | s :: s' :: rest => Continues CH RH cmb compress compressN s s' ∧ ChainBound (s' :: rest)

/-! ## 3. State-level continuity + the well-formed chain.

The Rust chain binding is over ROOTS; the executor model adds the underlying STATE continuity (step
`i`'s post-state IS step `i+1`'s pre-state — `RecChainedState` equality), which §5 shows the
root-level tooth recovers under CR. `lastStateOf` is the state the chain reaches from genesis. -/

/-- **`StateChained g steps`** — the steps form a contiguous executor run from genesis `g`: the first
step's pre-state is `g`, and each step's post-state is the next step's pre-state. -/
def StateChained (g : RecChainedState) : List ChainStep → Prop
  | []        => True
  | s :: rest => s.pre = g ∧ StateChained s.post rest

/-- **`lastStateOf g steps`** — the state the chain reaches from genesis `g`: genesis if empty,
else the last step's `post`. (Defined structurally so the run keystone can name the endpoint.) -/
def lastStateOf (g : RecChainedState) : List ChainStep → RecChainedState
  | []        => g
  | s :: rest => lastStateOf s.post rest

/-- **`WellFormedChain g steps`** — the steps are a genuine executor chain from genesis `g` AND the
root-level temporal tooth holds. -/

  bound   : ChainBound CH RH cmb compress compressN steps

/-! ## 4. The genuine final root of the whole history.

The accumulator's final claim is "`final_root` = the genuine fold of the whole history"
(`ivc_turn_chain.rs:18`): the §8 commitment of the kernel reached by folding `recCexec` over all the
turns. `lastStateOf g steps` IS that folded state; its commitment is the genuine final root. -/

/-- **`foldedFinalRoot g steps`** — the genuine final root: the DEPLOYED ROTATED commitment
(`chainedCommit` = kernel digest + receipt-log root) of the folded post-state (`lastStateOf`) under
the last step's turn-context (the `NEW_COMMIT` the accumulator exposes). The empty chain commits the
genesis kernel digest under `default` (the empty-chain anchor: no steps, hence no receipts to bind). -/

  match steps.getLast? with
  | none   => stateRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN g.kernel zeroTurn
  | some s => chainedCommit CH RH cmb compress compressN (lastStateOf g steps) s.turn

/-! ## 5. The CR recovery — the ROOT tooth recovers STATE continuity.

The accumulator's verifier only sees ROOTS, not states. Under collision-resistance of the commitment
(`compressInjective cmb`, via `recStateCommit_binds`), the root-level tooth recovers the underlying
kernel continuity. This is why the LIGHT CLIENT, seeing only roots, learns state
continuity — the §8 root is an injective full-state commitment. -/

/-- **`seam_roots_chain` (the easy direction).** State-level continuity at a seam ENTAILS
the root-level tooth: if `s.post = s'.pre` and the turn-contexts agree at the seam, their roots
chain. So an honest accumulator never asserts the tooth separately — it is free from execution. -/
theorem seam_roots_chain (s s' : ChainStep)
    (hstate : s.post = s'.pre) (hturn : s.turn = s'.turn) :
    ChainStep.newRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s
      = ChainStep.oldRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s' := by
  unfold ChainStep.newRoot ChainStep.oldRoot
  rw [hstate, hturn]

/-- **`root_tooth_pins_state` (THE CR RECOVERY).** Under collision-resistance of the
commitment combiner, the ROOT-level tooth pins the underlying full-state COMMITMENT: if two steps
share a turn-context and their seam roots agree, then their cell-digests AND rest-hashes agree
(`cellDigest s.post = cellDigest s'.pre ∧ RH s.post = RH s'.pre`). That is exactly the binding
`recStateCommit_binds` provides — the §8 root is an injective commitment to (live-cell digest, rest
hash), i.e. to the WHOLE kernel (every cell binds via `cellLeafInjective`; the 16 non-cell fields via
`RestHashIffFrame`). So a light client that sees only the matching roots GENUINELY learns the states
chained, up to CR. This is the load-bearing fact that makes "verify the succinct aggregate"
sufficient: the root IS the full-state commitment. -/

/-- **`root_tooth_pins_kernel` (THE STRENGTHENED CR RECOVERY — state-equality, not just commitment).**
The critique's precise gap: `root_tooth_pins_state` recovers only `cellDigest`+`RH` EQUALITY
(commitment-level), not the `s.post.kernel = s'.pre.kernel` STATE equality `StateChained` needs — so
the headline still took state continuity as a separate prover hypothesis. This closes it: under the
FULL standard Poseidon CR set + the PROVED-preserved `AccountsWF` structural invariant on BOTH seam
kernels, an agreeing root-tooth at a matched turn-context forces the WHOLE kernel equal
(`recStateCommit_binds_kernel`: `RH` recovers the 15 non-cell fields incl. `accounts`, then the cell
digest recovers `cell` over the now-common carrier). So a light client seeing only the matching roots
GENUINELY learns the adjacent KERNELS coincide — up to CR — not merely their commitments. (The
receipt LOG is the one `RecChainedState` component the §8 state root does NOT bind; see
`KernelChained` below — conservation rides on the kernel alone, so the log is conservation-irrelevant,
and that is the exact, named residual rather than a hidden hypothesis.) -/

The §2 repair, now at the aggregation seam: an agreeing root tooth at a matched turn-context forces the

`recStateCommit` was BLIND to the log (`NonOmissionAttack.recStateCommit_admits_receipt_omission`);
the rotated `chainedCommit` absorbs `logRoot … st.log` as its second limb, so the OUTER sponge peel
yields the log-root agreement and `logRoot_injective` recovers the whole audit log. A light client
seeing only the matching published roots GENUINELY learns the receipt logs coincide — no node dropped,
forged, reordered, or truncated a receipt at this turn. This is the component the §8 kernel root did
NOT bind, now bound (the residual named in `NonOmissionAttack` §3, closed). -/

/-! ### Conservation-over-history from KERNEL continuity alone (the §8 root binds the kernel, not the log).

`StateChained` is full `RecChainedState` equality at every seam — it includes the receipt LOG, which
the §8 state commitment does NOT bind (`recStateCommit`/`cellDigest`/`RH` are pure functions of the
kernel; `RecChainedState.log` is uncommitted). A light client verifying roots can therefore recover
KERNEL continuity (`root_tooth_pins_kernel`) but not log continuity. The headline content the critique
demands — conservation-over-history — needs ONLY kernel continuity (`recTotal` reads the kernel), so we
factor it through `KernelChained` and DERIVE it from the verified root teeth, with no `StateChained`
hypothesis. (Full `Run`/`StateChained` — which a few downstream theorems use for run-level facts beyond
conservation — is what additionally needs the log; named, not hidden.) -/

/-- The kernel projection of `recCexec`: a committed chained step commits the underlying kernel step

/-- **`KernelChained g steps`** — the steps form a contiguous executor run from genesis `g` AT THE
KERNEL LEVEL (the receipt log set aside): the first step's pre-KERNEL is `g`'s, and each step's
post-kernel is the next step's pre-kernel. This is exactly what the §8 root tooth recovers under CR

Genesis is a PUBLIC, agreed value (the chain's declared start, pinned in `Aggregate.genesisRoot`), so

/-- **`SeamStruct steps`** — the per-seam STRUCTURAL facts (NOT continuity, NOT roots): at every
adjacent pair the turn-contexts match AND both seam kernels are `AccountsWF`. These are exactly the
two non-cryptographic side facts `root_tooth_pins_kernel` consumes beyond the tooth itself: turn-match
holds under the accumulator's NoOp-padding (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:325`), and `AccountsWF` is the
structural invariant every `recKExec` PRESERVES (`StateCommit.recKExec_preserves_AccountsWF`). The
TOOTH itself is NOT here — it comes from `ChainBound`, which a verified `bindingProof` supplies. So
`SeamStruct` is the honest, non-prover-controlled structural envelope; continuity is DERIVED. -/

and the structural envelope `SeamStruct` (matched turns + `AccountsWF`), the whole chain is
`KernelChained`. Each inter-step seam `s.post.kernel = s'.pre.kernel` is DERIVED by
`root_tooth_pins_kernel` from the `ChainBound` tooth — it is no longer the prover-supplied `StateChained`
hypothesis the critique flagged. Kernel continuity (hence conservation) follows from the VERIFIED root
under the CR floor, with only the genesis pin + structural envelope as honest inputs. -/

Conservation across the WHOLE history with NO `StateChained` hypothesis: given the genesis pin, the
VERIFIED root tooth `ChainBound` (= `AggregateAttests.ordered`), and the structural envelope
`SeamStruct`, the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total. Composes
`kernelChained_of_verified` (verified tooth ⇒ kernel continuity, via the strengthened
`root_tooth_pins_kernel`) with `kernelChained_conserves` (kernel continuity ⇒ conservation). This is
the precise statement the critique asked for: "trusting the aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history"
now follows from the VERIFIED root, not from the prover's honesty about state continuity. -/

/-! ### NON-OMISSION over the WHOLE history from the VERIFIED root tooth (the §2 repair, lifted).

The kernel-continuity path (`kernelChained_of_verified`) recovers KERNEL continuity from the verified
root tooth; its RECEIPT-LOG twin recovers LOG continuity, by the EXACT same induction but riding
`root_tooth_pins_log` (the rotated commit's second limb) instead of `root_tooth_pins_kernel`. Where the
kernel root needed the full Poseidon CR set + `AccountsWF`, the log root needs ONLY `compressNInjective`
(the outer sponge peel + `logRoot_injective`) — `SeamStruct`'s turn-match alone, its `AccountsWF` arm
unused. So a light client trusting the aggregate learns the receipt log chains genuinely across EVERY
folded step: no node dropped, forged, reordered, or truncated a receipt ANYWHERE in history. -/

/-- **`LogChained g steps`** — the steps form a contiguous executor run from genesis `g` AT THE
RECEIPT-LOG LEVEL: the first step's pre-LOG is `g`'s, and each step's post-log is the next step's
pre-log. The log twin of `KernelChained` — exactly what the rotated commit's receipt-log root recovers
under CR (`root_tooth_pins_log`). -/
def LogChained (g : RecChainedState) : List ChainStep → Prop
  | []        => True
  | s :: rest => s.pre.log = g.log ∧ LogChained s.post rest

/-- **`LogGenesisPin g steps`** — the head step's pre-LOG is genesis `g`'s (vacuous if empty). The
honest, agreed genesis input (the published chain start), NOT the malicious surface (which is the
inter-step continuity, derived below). -/

  | []        => True

/-- **`logChained_of_verified` (THE NON-OMISSION DERIVATION — log continuity FROM verification).** From
the genesis log pin, the VERIFIED root tooth `ChainBound` (= `AggregateAttests.ordered`), and the
structural envelope `SeamStruct` (only its turn-match arm is used), the whole chain is `LogChained`:
each inter-step seam `s.post.log = s'.pre.log` is DERIVED by `root_tooth_pins_log` from the verified
tooth. So a light client verifying the aggregate root learns the receipt log chains genuinely across
the WHOLE history — omission impossible at every folded step — with NO `hweld`, resting on the rotated
commit's receipt-log limb under the one CR floor. -/

/-- **`chainBound_of_stateChained`.** State-level continuity entails the root-level temporal
tooth at every seam WHERE THE TURN-CONTEXTS AGREE. We state the per-seam fact directly via
`seam_roots_chain`; whole-list `ChainBound` follows when each seam's turn-contexts agree (the
configuration the accumulator's NoOp-padding establishes — see `ivc_turn_chain.rs:325`). This makes
`WellFormedChain.bound` derivable from `chained` at matched seams, so an honest chain is well-formed
without separately asserting the binding. -/

/-- **`wellformed_attests_whole_history` (THE HEADLINE).** A well-formed chain from genesis
`g` GENUINELY attests the whole history:
  (1) **every turn executed correctly** — for every step, `recCexec pre turn = some post` (the
      verified executor ran that turn);
  (2) **the chain is correctly ordered** — the root-level temporal tooth holds (`ChainBound`), so no
      reorder/drop/insert;
  (3) **the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history** — `foldedFinalRoot` commits the
      `lastStateOf`, the kernel reached by folding `recCexec` over ALL the turns, and the whole chain
      is a `Run recChainedSystem` from `g` to that state (so conservation et al. apply).
This is the meaning the IVC accumulator's `WholeChainProof` claims; `RecursiveAggregation.lean`
shows the SNARK aggregate, under the named soundness hypotheses, delivers EXACTLY this. -/

`ChainBound`). Both witnessed below over the concrete `ConsensusExec.teethGenesis`. -/

the ledger total through the KERNEL-continuity path (`kernelChained_conserves`, the conservation engine

two steps whose seam roots disagree, `ChainBound [s, s']` is `False` — exactly the
