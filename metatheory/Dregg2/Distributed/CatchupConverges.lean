# Dregg2.Distributed.CatchupConverges — STATE CATCH-UP convergence: a node that JOINS fresh
# or FALLS BEHIND, then receives the same causally-closed set of finalized blocks as a peer,
# reaches the SAME finalized executed state.

**The gap this closes.** `Distributed.LaceMerge` proves the CRDT delta-merge (`finality.rs::merge`)
is a pure JOIN on the content-addressed keyset, and that two replicas which merge the same block set
converge (`merge_convergence_to_state`). `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality` proves the `tau` ordering is
deterministic and wires it to the executor. NEITHER models the **catch-up RECEPTION path** that the node
runs — `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::handle_push` + `node/src/catchup.rs::apply_with_buffering` — where a
lagging/fresh node ingests blocks that arrive OUT OF ORDER or with GAPS, BUFFERS the orphans, requests the
missing predecessors, and re-applies them in CAUSAL order. The node-level claim we must justify is:

  *a node that has received the same causally-closed set of finalized blocks (in ANY arrival order,
   grouped into ANY deltas, with ANY amount of buffering) reaches the SAME finalized state as any peer.*

This file models THAT reception as a FOLD of the CRDT merge over the received blocks
(`catchupFrom = blocks.foldl (fun B b => mergeLace B [b]) []`) — each received block is merged into the
growing lace, exactly the skip-if-present insertion `receive_block`/`apply_with_buffering` performs (the
orphan buffer only DELAYS a merge until the block's past is present; it never admits a block out of causal
order and never drops one whose past arrives later, so the SET of blocks that ultimately enter the keyset is
invariant to the buffering — see `node/src/catchup.rs::out_of_order_delivery_converges_to_full_chain`). We
prove:

* **`catchup_keyset` (the reconstruction is exact).** `laceIds (catchupFrom blocks) = blocks.toFinset-ids`:
  catching up from a received block list yields a lace whose content-addressed keyset is EXACTLY the set of
  received block ids. The fold of merges accumulates the union (`LaceMerge.laceIds_mergeLace`), independent
  of order (so any arrival permutation gives the same keyset).
* **`catchup_order_independent` (arrival order is irrelevant).** Two nodes that receive the SAME set of
  blocks in DIFFERENT orders reach laces with the SAME keyset. This is the order-independence of catch-up:
  the lossy/out-of-order gossip + orphan-buffering converge to one content-addressed state.
* **`catchup_converges_to_leader` (THE convergence — a laggard matches the leader).** A node that catches up
  from the leader's full block set reaches the SAME finalized executed state as the leader: same keyset
  (`catchup_keyset`) ⇒ `SameView` (`LaceMerge.sameView_of_canonical_eq_ids`) ⇒ same `tauOrder` ⇒ same
  `executeTau` (`LaceMerge.merge_convergence_to_state`). This is "a caught-up node reaching the same
  finalized state IS LaceMerge convergence applied", stated end-to-end for the catch-up path.

## SCOPE.

FAITHFUL (matches the node catch-up path as a pure function of the received block SET):
* `catchupFrom blocks` — the fold of skip-if-present merges. The orphan buffer
  (`catchup.rs::OrphanBuffer`) is a SCHEDULING device: it reorders WHEN each block's merge happens so that a
  block is merged only once its predecessors are present, but the multiset of blocks merged is exactly the
  received set, and `mergeLace`'s keyset is order-independent (`LaceMerge.merge_comm/assoc`). So the keyset
  of the node's lace after catch-up depends only on the received SET — which is what `catchup_keyset` states.

SIMPLIFIED (a faithful PROJECTION, stated, not hidden — inherited from `LaceMerge`):
* The `tauOrder`-agreement seam (`hOrder`) is taken as an explicit hypothesis, TRUE because
  `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder` is permutation-invariant on canonical laces (it reads the lace through
  `lookup`/`filter`/`qsort`, all multiset-determined). We do NOT re-derive that permutation-invariance here
  (the named `LaceMerge` residual); everything else — the catch-up reconstruction + the convergence wire — is
  proved. For the identical-representative case `hOrder` is `tauOrder_deterministic` (`rfl`).
* Signature validity / causal closure are the §8 / `WellFormedDelta` hypotheses of `LaceMerge`; here a
  caught-up node is fed a well-formed closed set (`receive_block`/`apply_with_buffering` enforce sig+seq+
  equivocation at the Rust boundary — the A1 fix — and the buffer enforces causal order before each merge).

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); NO `sorry`/`:=True`/`native_decide`.

/-! ## 1. The catch-up reconstruction — a FOLD of the CRDT merge over received blocks.

A node catching up ingests blocks one delta at a time (`handle_push` calls `apply_with_buffering`, which
merges each block — possibly after buffering it until its predecessors land). We model the net effect as a
left-fold of `mergeLace` over the received blocks, starting from the empty lace (a fresh joiner). The orphan
buffer's reordering is invisible at this level: it only changes WHICH ARRIVAL becomes WHICH fold step, and
the keyset of a fold of merges is the union of all merged-in ids regardless of step order. -/

/-- **`catchupFrom blocks`** — the lace a node reconstructs by merging each received block in turn
(`catchup.rs::apply_with_buffering` over a received batch, with buffering folded out). Starts from the empty
lace (fresh joiner); a node already holding `B₀` catches up via `catchupOnto B₀ blocks`. -/
def catchupFrom (blocks : List Block) : Lace :=
  blocks.foldl (fun B b => mergeLace B [b]) []

/-- **`catchupOnto B₀ blocks`** — a node that already holds `B₀` (e.g. a checkpoint or its prior lace)
catching up by merging each received block. The lagging-node case: `B₀` is what it had before falling behind,
`blocks` are the finalized blocks it was missing. -/
def catchupOnto (B₀ : Lace) (blocks : List Block) : Lace :=
  blocks.foldl (fun B b => mergeLace B [b]) B₀

/-! ## 2. THE RECONSTRUCTION LAW — the caught-up keyset is exactly the received-id set. -/

/-- **`catchupOnto_keyset` (reconstruction is exact, lagging case).** Catching `blocks` up ONTO a
held lace `B₀` yields a keyset that is `laceIds B₀` plus exactly the received block ids. The fold of merges
accumulates the union one id at a time (`laceIds_mergeLace`), so the result depends only on the SET of
received ids — NOT their arrival order or grouping. This is the load-bearing fact behind "a caught-up node
holds exactly what it had plus what it received". -/

/-- **`catchup_order_independent`.** Two nodes that receive the SAME set of blocks (here: one list a
PERMUTATION of the other — same multiset, hence same id-toFinset) in DIFFERENT orders reconstruct laces with
the SAME keyset. The order-independence of the lossy/out-of-order catch-up: whatever order gossip delivered
the finalized blocks in, the caught-up content-addressed state is identical. -/

/-- **`catchup_order_independent_set` (the SET form).** More generally, any two received lists with
the SAME id-keyset reconstruct the same keyset, even if not literal permutations (e.g. one carries a
duplicate-gossip copy, or content-addressing collapses equal-id blocks). The robust statement the
dissemination layer relies on: catch-up converges on the id SET, not the delivery sequence. -/

/-! ## 4. THE CONVERGENCE THEOREM — a caught-up node matches the leader's finalized state.

We compose §2 (the caught-up keyset equals the received id set) with `LaceMerge.merge_convergence_to_state`
(same keyset + canonical + content-agreement ⇒ same executed state). The setup: a LEADER holds a canonical
lace `leader`; a LAGGARD catches up from a received list `recv` whose ids are exactly the leader's keyset
(it received the same causally-closed finalized set — what the catch-up `Pull`/`Push` deliver, with their
causal past). Then the laggard executes to the SAME `RecChainedState` as the leader. -/

/-- **`catchup_converges_to_leader` (THE end-to-end catch-up convergence).** A laggard node that
catches up from a received block list `recv` whose content-addressed keyset equals the leader's lace keyset —
with both laces canonical and content-agreeing on shared ids (the §8 content-addressing bridge) and finalizing
the same `tauOrder` (the `BlocklaceFinality` permutation-invariance seam) — EXECUTES TO THE SAME finalized
`RecChainedState` as the leader. This is the precise statement that *a node which has received the same
causally-closed set of finalized blocks reaches the same finalized state as any peer*: catch-up reconstruction
(`catchup_keyset`) feeding LaceMerge convergence (`merge_convergence_to_state`), end to end. -/

`catchup_converges_to_leader`). -/

/-! ## 5. NON-VACUITY — a concrete multi-step catch-up over a real (forked) finalized set.

Mirrors `node/src/catchup.rs`'s integration tests + `LaceMerge`'s Byzantine-fork witness: a LAGGARD receives
the SAME three causally-closed blocks (genesis + a creator-9 FORK `fork1 ∥ fork2`) as the leader, but in
REVERSE arrival order (the orphan buffer reorders them back), and the reconstruction reaches the SAME keyset
as the leader's full lace. The `#guard`s are the model⟺node differential: `apply_with_buffering` over these
blocks in any order yields the leader keyset, matching `catchup.rs::out_of_order_delivery_converges_to_full_chain`
and `two_replicas_converge_to_same_keyset`. -/

-- Two laggards converge to the SAME keyset despite different arrival orders.
#guard laceIds laggardCatchup == laceIds laggardCatchup2
-- A laggard that already held genesis, catching up the fork delta, lands on the leader keyset.
#guard laceIds (catchupOnto [b0] [fork1, fork2]) == laceIds leaderLace
-- Idempotent re-catch-up (duplicate gossip / at-least-once): re-receiving is inert.
#guard laceIds (catchupOnto laggardCatchup [b0, fork1, fork2]) == laceIds leaderLace

/-! The `#guard`s are the project's machine-checked non-vacuity teeth (a false `#guard` is a BUILD ERROR).
Against a CONCRETE multi-step catch-up over a Byzantine-forked finalized set: (i) a laggard receiving the
finalized blocks in reverse / shuffled order reconstructs EXACTLY the leader's keyset; (ii) two laggards with
different arrival orders converge; (iii) catching a delta ONTO a held genesis lands on the leader keyset; (iv)
re-catch-up is idempotent. So the convergence theorems constrain a REAL non-trivial catch-up, and the model
reproduces `catchup.rs`'s order-independent reconstruction. -/
