# Dregg2.Distributed.Revocation — topology-parametrized capability revocation.

Capability revocation is **clean single-machine** (`Authority.Credential`: the kernel revocation
registry is a grow-only `RevocationSet`, and `revoke_blocks_verify` flips a credential out of
admissibility the instant its id lands in the set). But **across nodes** there is a gap: a cap
revoked on node `m` is still honored by node `n` *until `n` sees the revocation*. This is the
non-monotone residue `Authority.CSpace` flags — "only `revoke` carries the CAP/FLP cost, with n=1
giving immediate full revocation and distributed giving topology-bounded revocation". This module
turns that prose into a **proved, topology-parametrized guarantee** (the dregg4 single-machine
principle: the honest bounds are *distributed* bounds — parametrize by the propagation model; n=1
collapses them to the strong property).

## The model (one new structure, everything else REUSED)

* A `RevEvent` is a revocation as it actually happens in a distributed system: *which* credential,
  at *which* origin node, at *which* logical issue-time. (The credential id REUSES
  `Authority.Credential.credId`; revocation content REUSES the `RevocationSet` G-Set.)
* A `Topology` is the propagation model: `nodes` (a finite participant set) and `delay : m → n → ℕ`
  — the bound on how long a revocation issued at `m` takes to reach `n` (logical time; the worst-
  case propagation delay of the gossip/consensus layer). `delay m m = 0` (a node sees its own
  revocations immediately) is the one law.
* A `System` is a `Topology` together with the log of `RevEvent`s that have been issued.
* **`localRevSet T log n t`** is what node `n` *locally believes* is revoked at time `t`: exactly
  the revocations that have had time to propagate — `event.issuedAt + T.delay event.origin n ≤ t`.
  This is the per-node `RevocationSet` reconstructed from the topology + the global log.
* **`honors`** = the per-node admissibility decision: `Authority.Credential.verify` against `n`'s
  *local* revocation set (REUSED verbatim — the same fail-closed keys-as-caps gate, just fed the
  stale local view).

## The theorems (the two faces of the single-machine principle)

* `eventual_bounded_revocation` — **distributed ⇒ EVENTUAL-BOUNDED**. If a credential was revoked
  at origin `m` at time `τ`, then for every node `n` and every `t ≥ τ + delay m n`, node `n` does
  NOT honor it. The bound `τ + delay m n` is **explicit**, and the property is "honored at most
  until the bound, NEVER after".
* `immediate_revocation` — **single-machine (n=1 / instantaneous propagation) ⇒ IMMEDIATE**. If the
  topology propagates instantly (`delay ≡ 0`, the n=1 collapse), then a credential revoked at `τ`
  is not honored at any `t ≥ τ` — the strong property, derived as a **corollary** of the bounded
  one (the bound `τ + 0 = τ`).
* `tightness_tooth` — **the bound is TIGHT (not vacuous)**. An explicit two-node system where a
  credential revoked at origin `m` at `τ` IS still honored by `n` at a time `t` with
  `τ ≤ t < τ + delay m n` — a stale-but-not-yet-propagated revocation being honored. So the bound
  cannot be improved; it is a real delay, not `0`.
* `single_machine_collapse` — the n=1 instance of the tooth's setup: under instantaneous
  propagation the stale window has length `0`, so the tooth's witness disappears and honoring stops
  exactly at `τ`.

§8 boundary: the attestation soundness is inherited from `Authority.Credential.verify`
(`CryptoKernel.verify` oracle) and never re-litigated. The propagation `delay` is an interface
parameter (the `World`/gossip layer supplies it); Lean assumes only `delay m m = 0`. The *liveness*
of propagation — that a revocation issued at `m` actually reaches `n` within `delay m n` — is the
hypothesis `Propagates` made explicit and witnessed, not smuggled.

Pure, computable, `#eval`/`#guard`-able.

/-! ## 1. The propagation model — topology, events, and the per-node local view.

`Time` is logical (`ℕ`): a monotone causal clock (cf. `Time.Causal` — the frame-invariant
happens-before order). A `Node` is a participant id. The topology's `delay m n` is the *bound* on
how long a revocation issued at `m` takes to be honored everywhere; the gossip/consensus layer is
the realiser. -/

/-- **A `Topology`** — the propagation model. `nodes` is the finite participant set; `delay m n`
is the worst-case logical delay for a revocation issued at `m` to reach (be honored at) `n`. The
single law `selfDelay` says a node sees *its own* revocations immediately — `delay m m = 0` — which
is the seam through which the single-machine collapse (n=1 ⇒ instantaneous) flows. -/

/-! ## 2. The per-node admissibility decision — `honors` (REUSES `Credential.verify`).

A node `n` HONORS a credential at time `t` exactly when the keys-as-caps verifier accepts it against
`n`'s *local* revocation view. Same fail-closed gate as single-machine (`Authority.Credential.verify`
= §8-oracle ∧ not-locally-revoked); the only difference is the revocation set fed in is the stale
`localRevSet`, not a global one. The whole distributed gap lives in that substitution. -/

/-- **`honors T log n t cred`** — does node `n` honor credential `cred` at time `t`? Exactly
`Authority.Credential.verify` against `n`'s local revocation set at `t`. REUSED verbatim: the
distributed model adds NO new admissibility logic, it only feeds the verifier a topology-derived
stale view. -/

    (T : Topology) (log : List RevEvent) (n : Node) (t : Time) (cred : VC Digest Proof) : Bool :=
  verify (localRevSet T log n t) cred

/-- A node honoring `cred` at `(n,t)` forces `cred`'s id to be NOT in `n`'s local revocation set
(the negative-discharge leg of `verify`). The contrapositive is what every revocation theorem uses:
once the id IS locally revoked, `honors` is false. -/

    (T : Topology) (log : List RevEvent) (n : Node) (t : Time) (cred : VC Digest Proof)

/-! ## 3. The keystone — DISTRIBUTED ⇒ EVENTUAL-BOUNDED revocation.

If `cred` was revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` (a `RevEvent` is in the log), then for every node
`n` and every `t ≥ τ + delay m n`, node `n` does NOT honor `cred`. The bound `τ + delay m n` is
EXPLICIT, and the property is "honored at most until the bound, and NEVER after it". -/

/-- A revocation of `cred` issued at origin `m` at time `τ`, recorded in the global log. The honest
hypothesis: a revocation actually happened (the log entry is the witness — no vacuous "True"). -/
def RevokedAt (log : List RevEvent) (cred : VC Digest Proof) (m : Node) (τ : Time) : Prop :=
  { cred := credId cred, origin := m, issuedAt := τ : RevEvent } ∈ log

/-- **THE KEYSTONE — `eventual_bounded_revocation`.** DISTRIBUTED ⇒ EVENTUAL-BOUNDED. If `cred` was
revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` (`RevokedAt`), then for EVERY node `n` and EVERY time `t` at or
after the explicit bound `τ + T.delay m n`, node `n` does NOT honor `cred`:

    honors T log n t cred = false        whenever   τ + T.delay m n ≤ t.

So a revoked cap is honored *at most until the revocation propagates* (the bound `τ + delay m n`)
and NEVER after. The propagation `delay` is the topology's; the proof routes through the local view
becoming revoked once the event has propagated (`mem_localRevSet`) and the fail-closed `verify`
(`revoke_blocks_verify`'s negative discharge). -/
theorem eventual_bounded_revocation [AddCommGroup Digest] [CryptoKernel Digest Proof]
    (T : Topology) (log : List RevEvent) (cred : VC Digest Proof) (m : Node) (τ : Time)
    (hrev : RevokedAt log cred m τ) (n : Node) (t : Time)
    (hbound : τ + T.delay m n ≤ t) :
    honors T log n t cred = false := by
  -- The event has propagated to `n` by `t`, so `cred`'s id is in `n`'s local revocation set.
  have hmem : credId cred ∈ (localRevSet T log n t).spent := by
    rw [mem_localRevSet]
    exact ⟨{ cred := credId cred, origin := m, issuedAt := τ }, hrev, rfl, hbound⟩
  -- A locally-revoked id ⇒ `verify` rejects (fail-closed negative discharge).
  unfold honors verify isRevoked
  rw [decide_eq_true (by exact hmem)]
  simp

/-! ## 4. The single-machine collapse — INSTANTANEOUS ⇒ IMMEDIATE (a corollary).

The dregg4 single-machine principle: n=1 (one node) — or, equivalently, instantaneous propagation —
collapses the bound `τ + delay m n` to `τ`, recovering the strong property "never honored at or
after `τ`". We model both n=1 *and* the instantaneous-link idealisation by `delay ≡ 0`. -/

/-- **`Instantaneous T`** — the single-machine / instantaneous-propagation idealisation: every link
has zero delay. This holds automatically for a one-node topology (every pair is `(m,m)`, and
`selfDelay` forces `delay m m = 0`); see `oneNode_instantaneous`. -/
def Instantaneous (T : Topology) : Prop := ∀ m n, T.delay m n = 0

/-- A ONE-NODE topology is `Instantaneous`: with a single participant `p`, every `(m,n)` pair is
`(p,p)`, and `selfDelay` gives `delay p p = 0`. The n=1 collapse is a *fact about the topology*, not
an extra assumption. -/
theorem oneNode_instantaneous (T : Topology) (p : Node) (hsingle : ∀ m, m ∈ T.nodes → m = p)
    (_hp : p ∈ T.nodes) :
    (∀ m ∈ T.nodes, ∀ n ∈ T.nodes, T.delay m n = 0) := by
  intro m hm n hn
  rw [hsingle m hm, hsingle n hn]
  exact T.selfDelay p

/-- **`immediate_revocation`** — SINGLE-MACHINE (instantaneous propagation) ⇒ IMMEDIATE revocation,
a COROLLARY of `eventual_bounded_revocation`. Under `Instantaneous T` (`delay ≡ 0`, the n=1
collapse), a credential revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` is NOT honored by any node `n` at ANY time
`t ≥ τ` — the bound `τ + delay m n` collapses to `τ + 0 = τ`. This is the STRONG property: a revoked
cap is never honored after revocation. -/

    honors T log n t cred = false := by
  apply eventual_bounded_revocation T log cred m τ hrev n t
  rw [hinst m n, Nat.add_zero]
  exact ht

/-! ## 5. The TOOTH — the bound is TIGHT (not vacuous).

A stale-but-not-yet-propagated revocation IS honored. We exhibit a concrete two-node system where a
credential revoked at origin `m=0` at time `τ=0` is still honored by node `n=1` at time `t=4`, with
`τ ≤ t < τ + delay m n` (the propagation delay is `5`, so `0 ≤ 4 < 5`). This shows
`eventual_bounded_revocation`'s bound cannot be tightened to anything below `τ + delay m n` — the
delay is real, and the guarantee is *eventual-bounded*, not immediate. -/

/-- **THE TOOTH (tightness).** In `toothTopology`, the credential `toothCred` was revoked at origin
`0` at time `τ = 0`, yet node `1` STILL HONORS it at time `t = 4` — because the cross-link delay is
`5`, and `τ + delay 0 1 = 0 + 5 = 5 > 4`. A stale-but-not-yet-propagated revocation being honored.
This witnesses that `eventual_bounded_revocation`'s bound is TIGHT: honoring persists up to
(but not including) `τ + delay m n`, so the guarantee cannot be strengthened to immediate in the
distributed setting. -/

/-! ## 6. Non-vacuity of the spec surface (a stale window exists).

`eventual_bounded_revocation` is non-vacuous because its hypothesis `RevokedAt` is *witnessed*
(`tooth_revoked`) AND its conclusion is *falsifiable before the bound* (`tightness_tooth`: honoring
is `true` strictly inside `[τ, τ + delay)`). The guarantee therefore says something real at exactly
the boundary — it is not a `True`-carrier. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity, assembled.** There is a system + credential where (a) the revocation is real, (b)
the credential is honored at some time strictly before the bound (stale window non-empty), and (c)
the credential is NOT honored at the bound. So `eventual_bounded_revocation` discriminates: the
"never honored after `τ + delay`" content rules out a real behavior that the "before the bound"
witness exhibits. -/
