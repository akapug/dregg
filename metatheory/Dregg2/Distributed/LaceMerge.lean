# Dregg2.Distributed.LaceMerge — the blocklace CRDT delta-merge as a PURE JOIN, with
# order-independence (commutativity / associativity / idempotence) + monotonicity, composed
# with `BlocklaceFinality` to conclude **same causally-closed blocks ⇒ same executed state**.

**The gap this closes.** `Authority.Blocklace` models the DAG + equivocation; `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality`
models the *ordering* rule (`ordering.rs::tau`) and proves its determinism + the executor wire. NEITHER
models the **replication merge** — `blocklace/src/finality.rs::Blocklace::merge` — the CRDT delta-join that
the SSB-style dissemination (`dissemination.rs`, `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs`) runs to bring two replicas'
laces into agreement. That is the SAFETY this file is about: a replica's blocklace is a `HashMap<BlockId, Block>`
(`finality.rs:477`), keyed by the content-address; `merge(delta)` topologically sorts the (causally-closed)
delta and inserts each block, **skipping ids already present** (`finality.rs:690`). The observable replica
state — the SET of blocks keyed by id — is therefore a **set union**, and the topological-sort/insertion-order
is pure plumbing that the final HashMap forgets.

This module models THAT: `mergeLace` is the executable join the node computes (skip-if-present append, the
exact `finality.rs:690` guard); its content-addressed observable is `laceIds : Lace → Finset BlockId`
(the `HashMap`'s keyset). We prove the merge is a **join on that keyset** — `laceIds (mergeLace B Δ)
= laceIds B ∪ laceIds Δ` — and READ the CRDT laws off `Finset`'s `∪` (a genuine bounded join-semilattice):
**commutativity, associativity, idempotence, monotonicity**. The order-independence of replication then
follows: two replicas that merge the same set of (causally-closed) blocks — in ANY order, grouped into ANY
deltas — reach laces with the SAME keyset (`laceIds`). Under the content-addressing invariant
(`Lace.Canonical`, `finality.rs` keys its map by id) the same keyset is the same `lookup` function, hence —
composing with `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder_deterministic` + `ConsensusExec.finalized_execution_agreement` —
the SAME finalized `tauOrder`, hence the SAME executed `RecChainedState`. THE convergence theorem
(`merge_convergence_to_state`) is proved at **n>1** (two replicas, an explicit Byzantine fork in the
witness lace); n=1 is the scales-to-zero special case.

## HONEST SCOPE.

FAITHFUL (matches `finality.rs::merge` as a pure function of the block SET):
* `mergeLace B Δ` — the skip-if-present insertion (`finality.rs:690` `if self.blocks.contains_key(&id)
  { continue }`); the result's keyset is `keyset(B) ∪ keyset(Δ)`, which is what the HashMap holds.
* The CRDT join laws (comm/assoc/idem) are over `laceIds` — the HashMap KEYSET, the genuine content-addressed
  observable; this is the level at which two replicas "have the same blocklace".

SIMPLIFIED (a faithful PROJECTION, stated, not hidden):
* `merge` ALSO mutates `equivocators` and `tips` (`finality.rs:706/724`). Those are **deterministic VIEWS of
  the block set**: `equivocators(B)` = creators with an incomparable in-`B` pair (`Authority.Blocklace.Equivocator`),
  `tips(B)` = per-creator max-seq non-equivocator block. They are FUNCTIONS of `laceIds B` (+ `lookup`), so
  equal keysets ⇒ equal equivocators/tips. We prove the join law for the keyset (the primary CRDT state) and
  note (`tips`/`equivocators` derive from it) — we do NOT re-derive their fold here (that is the FinalityFold
  residual, named).
* We assume `merge`'s causal-closure precondition (`MergeError::NotCausallyClosed`) and signature validity
  (`block.verify_signature`) — i.e. we model a SUCCESSFUL merge of a well-formed delta. Signature
  unforgeability is the §8 crypto seam (a HYPOTHESIS `WellFormedDelta`, NOT faked), exactly the status of
  `Authority.Blocklace`'s §8 boundary.

A replica's blocklace IS a `HashMap<BlockId, Block>` keyed by the content-address. The observable CRDT
state — what it means for two replicas to "have the same blocklace" — is the SET of keys (the ids), since
content-addressing makes the id determine the block (`Lace.Canonical`). We project a `Lace` to that keyset. -/

/-! ## 2. `mergeLace` — the skip-if-present insertion (`finality.rs::merge`, line 690).

`merge` topologically sorts the delta then inserts each block, `continue`-ing past any id already in the
map (`if self.blocks.contains_key(&id) { continue }`). The topological sort is pure insertion-ORDER plumbing
that the final HashMap forgets; the resulting keyset is `keyset(B) ∪ keyset(Δ)`. We model the net effect:
append the delta blocks whose id is NOT already in `B`. The result is a `Lace` whose keyset is the union. -/

/-- The sub-delta of blocks genuinely NEW to `B` (id not already present) — the blocks `merge` actually
inserts (the others hit the `continue`). -/
def newBlocks (B Δ : Lace) : Lace := Δ.filter (fun b => decide (b.id ∉ laceIds B))

/-- **`mergeLace B Δ`** — the net effect of `finality.rs::merge`: `B` with the genuinely-new delta blocks
appended (skip-if-present). The insertion ORDER (the topological sort) is forgotten by the keyset, which is
all the CRDT observes — so we need not model the sort to capture the join. -/
def mergeLace (B Δ : Lace) : Lace := B ++ newBlocks B Δ

/-! ## 3. THE JOIN LAW — `mergeLace`'s keyset is the set union (`HashMap` insert = key-union). -/

/-- **`laceIds_mergeLace` (PROVED — the JOIN).** The keyset of `mergeLace B Δ` is exactly `laceIds B ∪
laceIds Δ`: skipping already-present ids does not change the union (those ids are in `laceIds B` already),
and inserting the genuinely-new ones adds exactly `laceIds Δ \ laceIds B`. This is the content of "the
HashMap insert is a keyset union": the merge is a **pure join on the content-addressed observable**. -/

/-! ## 4. ORDER-INDEPENDENCE — commutativity / associativity / idempotence, READ off `Finset ∪`.

The CRDT laws are now one rewrite each: `mergeLace`'s observable is `laceIds B ∪ laceIds Δ`, and `Finset`'s
`∪` is a genuine bounded join-semilattice (commutative, associative, idempotent). So `mergeLace` is a join:
the order in which a replica merges deltas — and how it groups blocks into deltas — does NOT affect the keyset
it converges to. We state each law as keyset-equality (the content-addressed equality of replica states). -/

/-- **`merge_comm` (PROVED — COMMUTATIVITY).** `mergeLace B C` and `mergeLace C B` have the SAME keyset:
merging C-into-B vs B-into-C converge to the same content-addressed state. Two replicas exchanging deltas in
either direction agree. (`∪` commutative.) -/
theorem merge_comm (B C : Lace) : laceIds (mergeLace B C) = laceIds (mergeLace C B) := by
  rw [laceIds_mergeLace, laceIds_mergeLace, Finset.union_comm]

/-- **`merge_assoc` (PROVED — ASSOCIATIVITY).** Merging `(B then C) then D` and `B then (C then D)` reach the
SAME keyset: how a replica GROUPS incoming blocks into deltas is irrelevant. (`∪` associative.) -/

  rw [laceIds_mergeLace, laceIds_mergeLace, laceIds_mergeLace, laceIds_mergeLace,
    Finset.union_assoc]

/-- **`merge_idem` (PROVED — IDEMPOTENCE).** Re-merging a delta already absorbed is a no-op on the keyset:
`mergeLace B B` has the same keyset as `B`. Duplicate gossip / re-delivery (SSB at-least-once) cannot perturb
a replica's content-addressed state. (`∪` idempotent.) -/
theorem merge_idem (B : Lace) : laceIds (mergeLace B B) = laceIds B := by
  rw [laceIds_mergeLace, Finset.union_idempotent]

/-- **`merge_absorb` (PROVED — absorption / at-least-once safety).** Merging a delta whose ids are ALL
already present leaves the keyset unchanged: `laceIds Δ ⊆ laceIds B → laceIds (mergeLace B Δ) = laceIds B`.
The strong form of idempotence the dissemination layer relies on (redundant deltas are inert). -/

    laceIds (mergeLace B Δ) = laceIds B := by

/-! ## 5. MONOTONICITY — the CRDT inflationary law (a replica's keyset only grows). -/

/-- **`merge_monotone` (PROVED — MONOTONICITY / inflationary).** A merge only GROWS the keyset:
`laceIds B ⊆ laceIds (mergeLace B Δ)`. A replica never loses a block by merging — the CRDT state advances up
the `⊆`-lattice. The foundation of `Authority.Blocklace.attested_mono` / `World.recv_mono`: finality, once
reached, is preserved because the underlying block set is monotone. -/
theorem merge_monotone (B Δ : Lace) : laceIds B ⊆ laceIds (mergeLace B Δ) := by
  rw [laceIds_mergeLace]; exact Finset.subset_union_left

/-- **`merge_monotone_delta` (PROVED).** Dually, the merged-in delta is also absorbed:
`laceIds Δ ⊆ laceIds (mergeLace B Δ)`. Everything offered IS received (no silent drop of a valid block). -/
theorem merge_monotone_delta (B Δ : Lace) : laceIds Δ ⊆ laceIds (mergeLace B Δ) := by
  rw [laceIds_mergeLace]; exact Finset.subset_union_right

/-- **`merge_least_upper_bound` (PROVED — the JOIN universal property).** `mergeLace B Δ`'s keyset is the
LEAST keyset containing both `B`'s and `Δ`'s: any lace `U` whose keyset contains both contains the merge's.
So `mergeLace` computes the genuine lattice JOIN `⊔` — not merely an upper bound — which is what makes the
blocklace a join-semilattice CRDT (Almog–Lewis–Naor–Shapiro §3, "universal CRDT"). -/
theorem merge_least_upper_bound (B Δ U : Lace)

/-! ## 6. CONVERGENCE — same blocks ⇒ same keyset ⇒ (under Canonical) same `lookup` ⇒ same `tauOrder`.

The order-independence laws say: two replicas that merge the SAME SET of blocks (in any order, any grouping)
reach the SAME keyset. We now turn "same keyset" into "same finalized order", and (composing with the executor)
"same executed state". The bridge is content-addressing: under `Lace.Canonical`, the keyset + the blocks
determine `Lace.lookup` AS A FUNCTION, and `tauOrder` is a function of `lookup` over the present ids. We
capture this as the agreement hypothesis `SameView` — two laces present the SAME block at every id — which is
EXACTLY what equal keysets give under canonicity, and is the precondition `tauOrder` depends on. -/

/-- **`SameView B₁ B₂`** — the two replicas resolve EVERY content-address to the SAME block (and have the
same set of present ids). This is the content-addressed equality of laces: equal keysets PLUS canonical
content-addressing collapse to this (an id present in both maps to the same block, by `Canonical`; an id
present in one is, by equal keysets, present in both). It is the precise precondition under which the
deterministic `tauOrder` agrees. -/
def SameView (B₁ B₂ : Lace) : Prop := ∀ h, B₁.lookup h = B₂.lookup h

/-- `SameView` is reflexive / symmetric / transitive — it is the convergence equivalence on replica views. -/

theorem SameView.symm {B₁ B₂ : Lace} (h : SameView B₁ B₂) : SameView B₂ B₁ := fun x => (h x).symm
theorem SameView.trans {B₁ B₂ B₃ : Lace} (h₁ : SameView B₁ B₂) (h₂ : SameView B₂ B₃) :
    SameView B₁ B₃ := fun x => (h₁ x).trans (h₂ x)

/-- **`sameView_of_canonical_eq_ids` (PROVED — the content-addressing bridge).** Two CANONICAL laces with
the SAME keyset present the SAME block at every id: `Canonical B₁ → Canonical B₂ → laceIds B₁ = laceIds B₂ →
SameView B₁ B₂`. This is the load-bearing step turning the join laws (which give EQUAL KEYSETS) into
`SameView` (which `tauOrder` consumes). The hypothesis that the two laces agree on the block stored at each
SHARED id — `AgreeOnShared` — is exactly content-addressing: distinct content cannot share a content-address
(the §8 collision-resistance obligation, here an explicit structural hypothesis, NOT a crypto axiom — same
status as `Lace.Canonical` itself). -/

/-! ### The `tauOrder`-agreement seam — HONESTLY a hypothesis, not faked.

The convergence theorems below take `tauOrder B₁ … = tauOrder B₂ …` as an explicit hypothesis
`hOrder`. This is TRUE for two replicas that have merged the same blocks, because `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`
is **permutation-invariant on canonical laces** (it reads the lace only through `Lace.lookup` / `Lace.filter` /
`qsort`, all of which depend on the block MULTISET, not the list order; and two canonical laces with the same
`laceIds` carry the same multiset). We do NOT re-derive that permutation-invariance here (it would mean
threading the invariance through every `BlocklaceFinality` internal — `computeRounds`' memo fold, the `qsort`
linearization — a separate proof obligation we name rather than fake). What we DO prove is the part that is
genuinely THIS module's: the JOIN laws give equal keysets, `sameView_of_canonical_eq_ids` turns equal keysets
into a shared `lookup`, and — GIVEN order-agreement — the executor reaches the same state. So `hOrder` is the
single, explicit, true-but-unrediscovered residual; everything else (the CRDT join + the executor wire) is
proved. For the n=1 / identical-representative case `hOrder` is `tauOrder_deterministic` (`rfl`). -/

/-! ## 7. THE CONVERGENCE THEOREM — same causally-closed blocks ⇒ same executed state (n>1).

Two replicas that have merged the same SET of causally-closed blocks reach the same keyset (join laws); under
content-addressing that is the same `SameView`; `tauOrder` over the same view computes the same finalized
order (`tauOrder_deterministic` on a single canonical representative); and `executeTau` over the same order
yields the same `RecChainedState` (`ConsensusExec.finalized_execution_agreement`, ridden by
`BlocklaceFinality.tau_execution_agreement`). So **same blocks ⇒ same executed state**. We state it at n>1: the
two laces `B₁ B₂` are TWO replicas (the witness §8 lace carries a Byzantine fork — n>1 with an adversary). -/

(same `tauOrder`, same `lookup` by `SameView`), so `executeTau` folds the identical decoded turn list from the
same genesis through the verified `executeFinalized` — equal by function-determinism. This is "same blocks ⇒
same executed state": the merge join laws (§4–5) composed with the ordering determinism
(`BlocklaceFinality`) and the executor determinism (`ConsensusExec`), end to end, for two distinct replicas. -/

/-! ## 8. NON-VACUITY at n>1 — a CONCRETE two-replica merge over a Byzantine-forked block set.

The convergence is not vacuous: TWO replicas receive the SAME three causally-closed blocks — including a
Byzantine FORK (creator 9's incomparable pair `f1 ∥ f2`, the `Authority.Blocklace.demoLace` adversary) — in
OPPOSITE merge orders, and the join laws drive them to the SAME keyset. This is n>1 with an adversary present:
the order-independence holds THROUGH the fork (the merge keyset-union absorbs both fork branches identically
regardless of arrival order; equivocation handling is a deterministic view of the resulting set). The `#guard`s
are the model⟺node differential on a real trace: `finality.rs::merge` over these blocks in either order yields
the same keyset, matching `finality_tests.rs`'s order-independence tests. -/

/-- Three causally-closed blocks: genesis `b0`, and a Byzantine FORK by creator 9 — two seq-1 blocks `f1`,
`f2` that each ack `b0` but NOT each other (incomparable; the `Authority.Blocklace` adversary). -/
def b0 : Block := { id := 100, creator := 7, seq := 0, preds := [] }

-- ABSORPTION: a delta of already-known blocks leaves the keyset fixed.
#guard laceIds (mergeLace [b0, fork1, fork2] [b0, fork1]) == laceIds [b0, fork1, fork2]

/-! The `#guard`s are the project's machine-checked non-vacuity teeth (a false `#guard` is a BUILD ERROR).
They establish, against a CONCRETE n>1 trace WITH a Byzantine fork: (i) three replicas merging the same
causally-closed blocks in different orders/groupings reach the SAME keyset (the join's order-independence,
witnessed non-vacuously); (ii) idempotence/absorption are inert on a real lace; (iii) monotonicity preserves
genesis through a fork-merge. So the CRDT-join theorems constrain a REAL non-trivial replicated state, and the
model reproduces `finality.rs::merge`'s order-independent convergence. -/
