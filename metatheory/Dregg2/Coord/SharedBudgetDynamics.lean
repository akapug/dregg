# Dregg2.Coord.SharedBudgetDynamics — the SHARED-BUDGET DYNAMICS across the coordination tree:
# tau-ordered resolution conservation, epoch rebalance, and the Stingray Byzantine ceiling.

**The gap this closes.** `Distributed/EntangledJoint.lean` proved the *static-snapshot* shared-budget
facts: per-agent `spent ≤ ceiling` (`tryDebit_invariant`) and aggregate `totalSpent ≤ Σ ceilings`
(`totalSpent_le_ceilings`) on a FIXED allowance table. It does NOT model the **dynamics** that make
the optimistic over-allocation safe: `coord/src/shared_budget.rs`'s escalation/resolution lifecycle
(`Open → Closing → Rebalancing → Open`, `shared_budget.rs:98-107`) — specifically

  * `resolve_with_ordering` (`shared_budget.rs:551-587`): when concurrent debits OVERSPEND the true
    balance, Tier-3 (Cordial-Miners `tau`) provides a total order on the conflicting debit blocks;
    the resolver processes them in tau order, ACCEPTS a debit iff the running balance suffices, and
    REJECTS it otherwise (first-come-wins). THIS is the budget "conserved across the coordination
    tree": the accepted debits never exceed the true balance.
  * `rebalance` (`shared_budget.rs:614-678`): the epoch-close that deducts reported spending from the
    balance, rejects over-ceiling reports, and redistributes fresh allowances (version bump).
  * `compute_allowance_ceiling` (`shared_budget.rs:309-314`): the Stingray Byzantine formula
    `ceiling = balance * (f+1) / (2f+1)`, whose safety is the `f * ceiling` worst-case-overspend
    bound (`shared_budget.rs:21-28`, `test_byzantine_agent_overspend_is_bounded`).

None of these dynamics are modelled anywhere. This module models them faithfully and proves the
conservation/safety properties the running code relies on — the part that closes the loop on why the
deliberately-over-allocated allowances (`Σ ceilings > balance`, what lets agents spend concurrently)
are nonetheless SAFE.

## What is modelled (faithful to `coord/src/shared_budget.rs`)

  * `resolveOrdered` = `resolve_with_ordering` (`shared_budget.rs:560-580`): fold the tau-ordered
    debit amounts through a running balance; accept `a` iff `a ≤ remaining`, subtract on accept,
    reject otherwise. Returns the per-debit `Resolution` list and the final remaining balance —
    `shared_budget.rs:565-576` exactly. (We model the AMOUNTS in tau order; the block-id lookups and
    `DebitResolution` map are administrative.)
  * `Allowance`/`ceiling` = `AgentAllowance` (`shared_budget.rs:140-210`) and
    `compute_allowance_ceiling` (`shared_budget.rs:309-314`), `ResourceAmount = ℕ` (u64).
  * `rebalance` = `SharedResourceBudget::rebalance` (`shared_budget.rs:614-678`): sum reports
    (rejecting any over-ceiling, `:642-648`), deduct from balance (clamp at 0 on overspend,
    `:664-670`), bump version. We prove its balance-conservation on the no-overspend path.

## Safety properties PROVED (the conservation across the coordination tree)

  1. **TAU-RESOLUTION CONSERVATION** (`resolveOrdered_accepted_le_balance`): the SUM of all ACCEPTED
     debit amounts after `resolve_with_ordering` never exceeds the starting `total_balance`. This is
     THE property that makes optimistic overspend safe — even though the agents collectively *tried*
     to spend more than the balance (`is_overspent`), the tau-ordered resolution accepts only a
     balance-respecting prefix. The over-allocated ceilings never cause a real over-withdrawal.
     (`shared_budget.rs:565` `if amount <= remaining_balance` is exactly the accept gate.)
  2. **RESOLUTION DETERMINISM / FIRST-WINS** (`resolveOrdered_prefix_accepts`): a debit is accepted
     iff it fits the balance remaining after all EARLIER (tau-smaller) accepted debits — the
     first-come-wins rule the total order enforces; the same tau order ⇒ the same accept/reject
     verdicts on every node (consensus-consistency of the resolution).
  3. **REBALANCE BALANCE-CONSERVATION** (`rebalance_conserves`): on the no-overspend path,
     `new_balance + totalReported = old_balance` — the epoch-close exactly transfers the reported
     spend out of the pool (`shared_budget.rs:668-670` `self.total_balance -= total_spent`). No
     value is created or destroyed by reconciliation.
  4. **STINGRAY BYZANTINE BOUND** (`overspend_bounded_by_f_ceiling`): with `n` agents, at most `f`
     Byzantine, ceiling `= balance*(f+1)/(2f+1)`, the worst-case UNDETECTED overspend before
     rebalance is at most `f * ceiling` — `shared_budget.rs:21-28`'s stated invariant, PROVED:
     honest agents (`n - f`) reveal true spend at rebalance, so only the `f` Byzantine claims are
     unverifiable, each capped at `ceiling`.
  5. **CEILING IS A REAL SUB-BALANCE FRACTION** (`ceiling_le_balance`): `ceiling ≤ balance` for all
     `f` (since `f+1 ≤ 2f+1`) — no single agent's allowance exceeds the pool; over-allocation is
     purely in the SUM across agents (`Σ ceiling` can exceed balance, the concurrency win), never
     per-agent.

## Connection to the running code + to EntangledJoint

`resolveOrdered`/`rebalance`/`ceiling` are `shared_budget.rs` transcribed; the Rust differential
(`coord/src/coord_diff.rs`) runs the GENUINE `SharedResourceBudget` (`try_optimistic_debit` →
`escalate` → `resolve_with_ordering`) over the `test_full_escalation_round_trip` scenario
(`shared_budget.rs:1716`) and asserts the accept/reject verdicts + final balance agree with this Lean
model. The bridge to `EntangledJoint`: that module's `totalSpent ≤ Σ ceilings` is the *optimistic*
bound; THIS module's `Σ accepted ≤ balance` is the *settled* bound after escalation — together they
are the full COD safety story (optimistic over-allocate, tau-resolve back within the true balance).

## Scope

Ed25519 spending-certificate signatures (`shared_budget.rs` rebalance reports) are the named crypto
assumption — a "report" here is a verified report; we model the COUNTING/conservation `rebalance`
does on verified reports. The Byzantine bound is over the modelled allowance arithmetic. No
`sorry`/`:=True`/`native_decide`. `#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}).
No executor import.

allotted `ceiling balance f`, and at most `f` Byzantine, the maximum overspend the honest majority
cannot detect before rebalance is `f * ceiling balance f`. We prove: the total an adversary of `f`
agents can spend (each up to its ceiling) is `f * ceiling`, and this is the entire undetectable
surplus, because the `n - f` honest agents reveal their true spending at rebalance. Stated as: the
adversarial spend `≤ f * ceiling`. -/

The `f * ceiling` overspend is a genuine bound: with `f ≥ 1` and the ceiling a `(f+1)/(2f+1) ≈ 1/2`
fraction, `f * ceiling < balance * f` — the Byzantine surplus is sub-linear in the naive
`n * ceiling` worst case, which is the entire point of the `(f+1)/(2f+1)` choice over `1/1`. -/
