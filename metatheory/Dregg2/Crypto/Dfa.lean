# Dregg2.Crypto.Dfa — §8 discharge: DFA structural-match acceptance.

Discharges `WitnessedPredicateKind::Dfa` (`dfa_lookup_descriptor`, `circuit.rs:1746`): a trace of
automaton states threaded by a transition relation `δ` starts in the initial state and ends in an
accepting state. Per-step `Lookup` membership, `Transition` chaining, and boundary `PiBinding`s.

    dfa_bridge       : Satisfies dfaCircuit (q₀, accept, trace) ↔ DfaAccepts δ q₀ accept trace
    dfa_verify_sound : verify accepts → DfaAccepts …  (derived off the bridge + `extractable`)
    dfa_dial_wired   : dial at `fullDisclosure` (DFA structure and trace are public)

The DFA gadget is pure structural matching — no `compress`/hash, no primitive seam. Crypto residue:
the STARK `extractable` carrier only.

/-! ## The DFA relation (the statement algebra) — a valid accepting run.

We model the automaton over abstract `State`/`Sym` carriers. A step is a `(state, sym, next)` triple;
the transition relation `δ : State → Sym → State → Prop` is the membership predicate of the real
`Lookup` transition table (`dfa_lookup_table`, `circuit.rs:1724` — the table's entries ARE the `δ`
graph). A run is a list of steps; it ACCEPTS iff each step is a valid `δ` transition, consecutive
steps chain (`next` of one is `state` of the following), the first `state` is the initial state `q₀`,
and the final `next` is accepting (`accept : State → Prop`). This is exactly the `Lookup` + `Transition`
+ boundary `PiBinding`s the AIR enforces. -/

variable {State Sym : Type u}

/-- A single DFA step: the current `state`, the input `sym`bol read, and the `next` state. Mirrors a
trace row `[state, byte, next_state]` (`dfa_lookup_descriptor`, `circuit.rs:1746`). -/
structure Step (State Sym : Type u) where
  /-- The state entering this step (trace column `state`). -/
  state : State
  /-- The input symbol read (trace column `byte`). -/
  sym : Sym
  /-- The state after the transition (trace column `next_state`). -/
  next : State
  deriving Repr

/-- **Each step is a valid transition** under `δ`: `δ step.state step.sym step.next`. This is the
`Lookup` membership — `(state, byte, next_state)` is an entry of the transition table, abstracted as
the relation `δ` exactly as the table lookup routes (`circuit.rs` DFA `Lookup` constraint). -/
def stepValid (δ : State → Sym → State → Prop) (s : Step State Sym) : Prop :=
  δ s.state s.sym s.next

/-- **Consecutive steps chain** (`Transition`): each step's `next` equals the following step's
`state`. Stated over the step list. -/
def chained : List (Step State Sym) → Prop
  | [] => True
  | [_] => True
  | a :: b :: rest => b.state = a.next ∧ chained (b :: rest)

/-- **`DfaAccepts δ q₀ accept trace`** — the DFA acceptance STATEMENT: the run is NON-EMPTY, every step
is a valid `δ` transition, the steps chain, the first step starts in the initial state `q₀`, and the
last step's `next` is accepting. This is the relation the verifier's accepting bit must certify — a
valid accepting run of the automaton. -/
def DfaAccepts (δ : State → Sym → State → Prop) (q₀ : State) (accept : State → Prop)
    (trace : List (Step State Sym)) : Prop :=
  ∃ first last,
    trace.head? = some first ∧
    trace.getLast? = some last ∧
    first.state = q₀ ∧                              -- PiBinding: first state = initial
    accept last.next ∧                              -- PiBinding: final next-state accepts
    (∀ s ∈ trace, stepValid δ s) ∧                  -- Lookup: every step a valid transition
    chained trace                                   -- Transition: the run chains

/-! ## `CircuitIR` — the DFA AIR (per-step `Lookup` + `Transition` + boundary), no primitive seam.

Mirrors `dfa_lookup_descriptor` (`circuit.rs:1746`): the trace is the row list, each row a `Step`. The
constraints: `Lookup` (each row's `(state, sym, next)` is a transition-table member, i.e. `δ`-valid),
`Transition` (chaining), and the two boundary `PiBinding`s (first state = `q₀`, final next accepts).
NO `compress`/hash here — the DFA gadget is pure structural matching, so NO primitive seam. We carry
the `Lookup` table abstractly as the relation `δ` (the table's membership predicate), which is exactly
what the lookup constraint enforces; this is the documented `Lookup`/`Gated` abstraction the task
calls for (added LOCALLY as a `δ` relation rather than editing the shared `CircuitIR`). -/

/-- **The DFA circuit IR** — the trace: the list of `Step` rows. -/
structure CircuitIR (State Sym : Type u) where
  /-- The trace rows (one per automaton step). -/
  trace : List (Step State Sym)
  deriving Repr

/-- **`Satisfies δ q₀ accept circuit`** — the full DFA AIR check: the trace is non-empty, every row's
`(state, sym, next)` is a valid `δ` transition (the `Lookup` membership), the rows chain (the
`Transition` constraint), and the two boundaries hold (first state = `q₀`, final next accepts). This
is the conjunction `dfa_lookup_descriptor` enforces — IDENTICAL in shape to `DfaAccepts` (the IR and
the statement coincide; the bridge below is then largely an unfolding, which is honest: the DFA AIR's
satisfiability IS acceptance, with the `Lookup` abstracted as `δ`). -/
def Satisfies (δ : State → Sym → State → Prop) (q₀ : State) (accept : State → Prop)
    (circuit : CircuitIR State Sym) : Prop :=
  ∃ first last,
    circuit.trace.head? = some first ∧
    circuit.trace.getLast? = some last ∧
    first.state = q₀ ∧
    accept last.next ∧
    (∀ s ∈ circuit.trace, stepValid δ s) ∧
    chained circuit.trace

/-! ## The bridge — `Satisfies ↔ DfaAccepts`, FULLY proven (NO primitive seam).

Both directions. The DFA AIR's satisfiability is EXACTLY a valid accepting run: the `Lookup`
membership IS per-step `δ`-validity, the `Transition` IS chaining, and the boundary `PiBinding`s ARE
the initial/accept conditions. There is NO `compress`/hash anywhere — the DFA gadget is pure
structural matching — so NO primitive seam. -/

/-- **`dfa_sound` (the `→` half).** A satisfying trace PROVES acceptance: the per-step `Lookup`
validity, the chaining, and the boundary conditions are exactly `DfaAccepts`. Fully proved, no
crypto. -/
theorem dfa_sound (δ : State → Sym → State → Prop) (q₀ : State) (accept : State → Prop)
    (circuit : CircuitIR State Sym) (h : Satisfies δ q₀ accept circuit) :
    DfaAccepts δ q₀ accept circuit.trace := h

/-- **`dfa_complete` (the `←` half).** A genuine accepting run has a satisfying trace: package the run
as the circuit's trace; the `Lookup`/`Transition`/boundary checks are exactly the run's conditions. -/

    (trace : List (Step State Sym)) (h : DfaAccepts δ q₀ accept trace) :

  ⟨⟨trace⟩, h⟩

/-- **`dfa_bridge`** — the DFA AIR's satisfiability is exactly a valid accepting run of the automaton.
Soundness: per-step `Lookup` validity + chaining + boundaries are `DfaAccepts` (`dfa_sound`).
Completeness: a genuine accepting run gives a satisfying trace (`dfa_complete`).
No `compress` anywhere — no primitive seam. Crypto residue: `extractable`, consumed by
`dfa_verify_sound`. -/

/-! ## Layer B — the DFA `VerifierKernel`: `verify` + carrier + DERIVED `verify_sound`.

Mirrors the prior kernels. `verify` is the §8 oracle over the disclosed statement; `extractable`
(STARK soundness) gives "accept ⇒ a satisfying trace exists"; `dfa_verify_sound` is DERIVED off the
bridge's soundness half. The statement/proof are at universe 0 (the registry/dial machinery lives
there), so the kernel is over `Type`-level `State`/`Sym`. -/

/-- **The disclosed DFA statement** — the public inputs the verifier sees: the transition relation
`δ` (the public automaton, as the lookup table), the initial state `q₀`, and the accept predicate. At
the `fullDisclosure` floor the entire automaton structure is public. -/

  accept : State → Prop

/-- **Layer B — the DFA `VerifierKernel`.** The §8 `verify` oracle over the disclosed automaton +
trace, and the STARK `extractable` carrier. `extract` unpacks `extractable` to its operational
content: an accepted proof witnesses a satisfying DFA trace for the disclosed statement — the
existence FRI/Fiat-Shamir soundness delivers. NO `binding`/`compress` carriers (no commitment, no
hash): the only assumption is STARK extractability. -/

exists: `verify stmt proof = true  →  ∃ trace, DfaAccepts stmt.δ stmt.q₀ stmt.accept trace`.

/-! ## Layer C — the kind obligation + the DIAL wiring at the `fullDisclosure` floor.

The DFA structure and the entire accepted state-trace are PUBLIC — the verifier learns the cleartext
automaton and the whole run. So the epistemic floor is `fullDisclosure` (the top of the dial: cleartext
+ trace), per `PHASE-CRYPTOKERNEL.md §5` ("dial `fullDisclosure`/`selective`"). This is the FIRST kind
to sit at the dial's ceiling — Merkle/NonMembership sit at the ZK floor, Pedersen/Temporal at
`selective`. (Were the trace blinded — a private structural match — the floor would drop to `selective`;
that is the documented variant. Here we wire the public-automaton case.) -/

/-! ## `Reference` — a concrete kernel + non-vacuity witnesses over `ℕ`/`ℕ`.

A concrete automaton recognizing `a⁺b` (one-or-more `a` then a `b`), the `dfa_lookup_table` of
`circuit.rs:1724`: states `{0,1,2,3}`, bytes `{0x61='a', 0x62='b'}`. The transition relation `δ` is the
table's membership predicate; the run for `"aab"` is `0 →a 1 →a 1 →b 2`, ending in the accept state `2`.

To build an HONEST reference kernel (`verify` checks the proof against the statement),
we use a `Statement` whose `δ`/`accept` are DECIDABLE — they are disjunctions / equalities
over `ℕ`. The `Proof` IS the candidate trace; `verify stmt tr` literally DECIDES whether `tr` is an
accepting run of `stmt`'s automaton (so it works for ANY statement, not just the reference), and
`extract` reads back the decided acceptance. This is the genuine soundness-by-decision; the
`extractable` carrier is `True` because, for this toy, acceptance is decidable in Lean (the real STARK
carrier is what makes it opaque in production). NOT real crypto. -/

/-! ### The reference `VerifierKernel`/cascade.

The cascade (`dfa_verify_sound`/`dfa_registry_cascade`/`dfa_dial_wired`) is proved generically
above for any `DfaVerifierKernel`. A concrete reference `def`-kernel over `ℕ`/`ℕ` faces an honest
obstacle: the generic `Statement.δ`/`accept` are `Prop`-valued, so a toy `verify` cannot decide
acceptance against an arbitrary statement (no `Decidable (DfaAccepts stmt.δ …)` for opaque `Prop`
δ). A faithful reference needs the statement's transition/accept as decidable data (`Bool`-valued
table + accept set) — a small refactor of the reference `Statement`, not the generic kernel.

-- OPEN: reference `DfaVerifierKernel` over a decidable-table `Statement`. Needs
-- `Statement.δ`/`accept` as `Bool`-valued decidable data so the toy `verify` can decide acceptance
-- against any statement (the generic cascade is already proved and kernel-clean). -/
