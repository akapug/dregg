# Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeReduction — the sponge/commitment CR REDUCED to the permutation compression CR.

`Dregg2/Circuit/Poseidon2Binding.lean` grounds the whole full-state commitment tower on a SINGLE
named assumption `Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` (`∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys`), and the
crypto-ledger classified that named assumption as IRREDUCIBLE PRIMITIVE #4 "at the sponge level".

That left a real gap: `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is a statement about an UNBOUNDED-arity hash over `List ℤ`.
The genuine cryptographic primitive a Poseidon2 implementation rests on is much smaller — the
collision-resistance of ONE FIXED-WIDTH permutation `P : State → State`, used as a per-block
compression. The sponge over that permutation is a CONSTRUCTION, and the security of the construction
is a THEOREM (the sponge / Merkle–Damgård domain-extension reduction), not a fresh assumption. This
module discharges that theorem.

## What is modelled (faithful to `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs::hash_many`)

The real `hash_many` (`poseidon2.rs:369`) over `inputs : &[BabyBear]`, `rate = 4`, width 16:

```rust
let mut state = Poseidon2State::new();           // all-zero state
state.state[4] = BabyBear::new(inputs.len());    // capacity domain-sep: length
for chunk in inputs.chunks(rate) {               // absorb, rate-4 chunks
    for (i, &e) in chunk.iter().enumerate() { state.state[i] += e; }
    state.permute();                             // the FIXED-WIDTH permutation P
}
state.state[0]                                   // squeeze slot 0
```

abstracted as a `SpongeMachine`:
  * `perm    : State → State`     — the fixed-width Poseidon2 permutation (`Poseidon2State::permute`).
  * `init    : ℕ → State`         — `new()` then capacity slot ← length (the length domain-sep tag).
  * `absorb  : State → List ℤ → State` — add a (≤rate) chunk into the rate slots (`state[i] += e`).
  * `squeeze : State → ℤ`         — read slot 0.
  * `chunksOf rate`               — `inputs.chunks(rate)` (modelled by `List.toChunks`, flatten-invertible).

with `step s a := perm (absorb s a)` the per-block compression and
`spongeOf xs := squeeze (foldl step (init xs.length) (chunksOf xs))` the whole `hash_many`.

## The reduction (a real proof, NOT a relabel)

`Poseidon2SpongeCR (spongeOf …)` is DISCHARGED from THREE separate pieces — two irreducible
crypto carriers and one structural domain-separation fact, ALL stated explicitly:

  1. **`CompressionCR M`** — IRREDUCIBLE PRIMITIVE: ONE permutation call, used as the per-block
     compression `step = perm ∘ absorb`, is collision-resistant as a chaining function (equal next
     FULL state ⇒ equal predecessor state AND equal absorbed block). Primitive #4 for a single `perm`.
  2. **`SqueezeBindsReachable M`** — the truncation residual: the slot-0 squeeze is injective on
     REACHABLE final sponge states (a digest collision without a final-state collision is exactly a
     last-permutation truncation collision). The honest narrow-output bit.
  3. **`InitStepSeparated M`** — STRUCTURAL domain separation: an `init` output (rate slots 0,
     capacity = length tag) is never a `step` output (a `perm` image). This is the length-prefix
     domain separation that makes the construction prefix-free; it is a structural property of the
     real `init`/`perm` (proved for the `Reference` machine by construction), NOT a crypto assumption.

`spongeCR_of_reduction`: a digest collision ⇒[2] final-state collision ⇒[1 + 3 MD peel] equal block
lists ⇒[`chunksOf` flatten-invertible] equal inputs. The crypto content is exactly `CompressionCR` +
`SqueezeBindsReachable`; `InitStepSeparated`, `chunksOf`, the induction are structural.

l4v bar: every theorem pins `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (`#assert_axioms`).

/-! ## §1 — the irreducible carriers + the structural domain-separation field. -/

variable {State : Type}

/-- **`CompressionCR M`** — the per-block compression `step = perm ∘ absorb` is collision-resistant as
a chaining function: a collision in the next FULL state forces equal predecessor state AND equal
absorbed block. THE irreducible primitive (one permutation call), primitive #4 for a single `perm`.

⚠ **BROKEN AS NAMED — FALSE for ANY REAL SPONGE, so `foldl_step_eq`, `finalState_inj` and the headline
`spongeCR_of_reduction` below are ALL VACUOUSLY TRUE at deployed parameters**
(`Crypto.SpongeCompressionRegrounded.compressionCR_false_of_finite_state`;
`docs/deos/VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2). Uncurried, `step : State × List ℤ → State` has an INFINITE
domain (`List ℤ`) and a FINITE codomain — and `[Finite State]` is the WHOLE hypothesis, needing no
numeric bound, because a fixed-width permutation state IS a finite type. So the reduction that demotes
the tower's `spongeCR` carrier from "an unbounded list-hash is injective" to "ONE permutation call is
CR" transports nothing at a real sponge.

**The honest replacement is `Crypto.SpongeCompressionRegrounded`** — `spongeCR_of_reduction`'s
advantage-bounded sibling, via `peel`: a CONSTRUCTIVE extractor that walks the two `foldl step` chains
from the last block inward and RETURNS the first divergence as an explicit `(state, block)` collision
— this file's own `foldl_step_eq` induction run BACKWARDS (where that theorem CONSUMES `CompressionCR`,
`peel` PRODUCES the collision a disagreement forces), with `InitStepSeparated` discharging the
boundary exactly as it does here. Carries an explicit undischarged `Eff`. This def is KEPT so the
record and the teeth keep compiling. -/

two inputs with equal digests have equal final states. The honest truncation residual. -/
def SqueezeBindsReachable (M : SpongeMachine State) : Prop :=
  ∀ xs ys : List ℤ, M.spongeOf xs = M.spongeOf ys → M.finalState xs = M.finalState ys

/-- **`InitStepSeparated M`** — STRUCTURAL domain separation: an `init` output is never a `step`
(`perm`) output. The length-prefix tag (`state[4] = len`, rate slots 0) lives in a part of the state a
fresh `perm` image does not reproduce; this makes the construction prefix-free. A structural property
of the real `init`/`perm` (the `Reference` machine proves it by construction), not a crypto carrier. -/
def InitStepSeparated (M : SpongeMachine State) : Prop :=
  ∀ (n : ℕ) (s : State) (a : List ℤ), M.init n ≠ M.step s a

/-! ## §2 — the MD induction: equal final states ⇒ equal block lists (⇒ equal inputs).

By double `reverseRecOn`: a matched final state forces (via `CompressionCR`) the last blocks equal and
the predecessors equal, recursing. The empty-vs-nonempty boundary (`init` vs `step` output) is the
case `InitStepSeparated` rules out — that is exactly where the length-prefix earns its keep. -/

/-- Equal `foldl step` runs (from ANY inits in the `init`-image) have equal block lists. The crux: the
asymmetric base cases equate an `init` with a `step` output, excluded by `InitStepSeparated`. Nested
`reverseRecOn` peels the LAST block on each side, so `foldl_concat` exposes the terminal `step`. -/

equality (`foldl_step_eq`) with the flatten-invertibility of `chunksOf`. Pure structural + the
compression CR; no truncation hardness yet (this is the FULL-state level). -/

collision-resistant, REDUCED to: the per-permutation-call compression CR (`hC`), the slot-0 truncation
residual (`hSq`), and the structural length-prefix domain separation (`hSep`). A real reduction: a
digest collision is lifted (truncation residual) to a FINAL-STATE collision, which the MD induction
peels into a compression collision; no fresh assumption beyond the two named carriers. -/

A concrete machine over `State := ℕ × List ℤ` (chaining nat × accumulated blocks), with an INJECTIVE
"permutation" (the carriers HOLD), so every reduction above FIRES on a real instance — and the
carriers are provably FALSE on a degenerate machine (a constant squeeze / a non-prefix-free init),
witnessing they are not `True`. The genuine Poseidon2 leaves CR as the standing obligation; here we
discharge with a provably-injective stand-in, exactly as `PortalFloor.Reference` does. -/

`Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2RealizedSponge` is the bundle the whole `StateCommit` tower consumes; it
carries `spongeCR` as a FIELD. Before this module that field was the IRREDUCIBLE sponge-level CR.
`realizedSpongeOfReduction` now BUILDS that bundle from a `SpongeMachine` + the reduction, so the
`spongeCR` the tower consumes is PROVED by `spongeCR_of_reduction` (the MD/permutation reduction)
rather than assumed at the sponge level. The named obligation drops from "the unbounded list-hash is
injective" to "ONE permutation call is CR (`CompressionCR`) + the slot-0 truncation residual
(`SqueezeBindsReachable`)" — a strictly smaller, deeper carrier. -/

the REAL `babyBearD4W16` p3 params), with its `spongeCR` field DISCHARGED by the permutation reduction.
This is what makes `Poseidon2SpongeCR` DISCHARGEABLE (not primitive-at-the-sponge-level): the
tower's `spongeCR` carrier is now a THEOREM over `CompressionCR` + `SqueezeBindsReachable`. -/
