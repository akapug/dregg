# Dregg2.Crypto.BlindedSet — §8 discharge: blinded issuer-set membership.

A holder proves membership in an issuer's authorized set (a Poseidon2 Merkle commitment over its
members) without revealing which member (`blinded_leaf = hash_fact(leaf,[blinding])`). The
membership relation IS a Merkle membership against the issuer root, so the gadget reuses
`Crypto.Merkle` wholesale. Blinding is a separate epistemic obligation (dial floor +
`HolderAnonymity` carrier), never an `axiom`/`sorry`.

    blindedset_bridge       : Satisfies blindedSetCircuit (root, member) ↔ MemberOf member set
    blindedset_verify_sound : verify accepts → MemberOf  (derived off the bridge + `extractable`)
    blindedset_dial_wired   : dial pinned to verifier at `acceptanceOnly` (ZK floor; holder hidden)

Cryptographic residue: (a) `compress` collision-resistance (`collisionHard`, consumed by
`extractable`); (b) holder-anonymity indistinguishability (`HolderAnonymity` carrier). Both are
honest `Prop` carriers, never `axiom`/`sorry`.

/-! ## The blinded issuer-set membership relation (reusing the Merkle gadget).

The authorized set is committed as a Poseidon2 Merkle tree; `root` is the issuer's
authorized-set commitment. A holder is authorized iff its member key has a Merkle path
recomposing the issuer root — i.e. `Merkle.MerkleMembers`. `compress` (the node hash) stays
abstract; the bridge is the pure recomposition equivalence, with NO primitive seam. The
HOLDER-ANONYMITY (blinding) is a SEPARATE epistemic obligation handled by the dial floor +
the `HolderAnonymity` carrier below — it is NOT a constraint of the membership relation. -/

variable {Digest : Type u}

/-- **`MemberOf compress root member`** — the BlindedSet STATEMENT relation: `member` is in the
issuer's authorized set committed at `root`, i.e. it has a Merkle path recomposing the issuer
root. This is DEFINITIONALLY `Merkle.MerkleMembers` (a BlindedSet membership IS a Merkle
membership against the issuer root); the reuse is total, no new combinatorics. -/
def MemberOf (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest) (root member : Digest) : Prop :=
  MerkleMembers compress root member

/-! ## `CircuitIR` — the blinded membership AIR, REUSING the Merkle gadget verbatim.

`generate_blinded_merkle_poseidon2_trace` is the Merkle membership trace plus a per-row blinding
column (`blinded = hash_fact(current, [blinding])`) and a public-input swap (`blinded_leaf` for
the cleartext leaf). The MEMBERSHIP constraints — `MerkleHash` per row, `Transition` continuity,
the boundary `PiBinding`s — are EXACTLY the Merkle AIR's. So the circuit IS a `Merkle.CircuitIR`;
the blinding column is the epistemic (anonymity) layer, orthogonal to the recomposition the
bridge proves. We therefore reuse `Merkle.CircuitIR`/`Merkle.Satisfies` directly. -/

/-- **The blinded-set circuit IR** — a `Merkle.CircuitIR` (the membership sub-AIR); blinding is
the orthogonal anonymity column, not part of the recomposition relation. -/
abbrev CircuitIR (Digest : Type u) := Merkle.CircuitIR Digest

/-- **`Satisfies compress circuit root member`** — the blinded-set AIR check: the Merkle
membership AIR over `(root, member)` (every row's `MerkleHash`, `Transition` continuity, the two
boundary `PiBinding`s). The blinding is the epistemic layer (dial floor), not a satisfiability
constraint — so satisfiability IS Merkle satisfiability. -/
def Satisfies (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest)
    (circuit : CircuitIR Digest) (root member : Digest) : Prop :=
  Merkle.Satisfies compress circuit root member

/-! ## The bridge — `Satisfies ↔ MemberOf`, FULLY proven by REUSING `merkle_bridge`.

Both directions are `merkle_bridge` verbatim (BlindedSet membership = Merkle membership against
the issuer root). `compress` is abstract throughout — NO primitive seam. The only cryptographic
residue is `compress`'s CR (consumed by `extractable`, never here) and the holder-anonymity
indistinguishability (the dial-floor carrier, below). -/

/-- **`blindedset_sound` (the `→` half).** A satisfying blinded-membership trace PROVES the
holder is in the issuer's authorized set: `merkle_sound` extracts the recomposing path. -/
theorem blindedset_sound (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest) (root member : Digest)
    (circuit : CircuitIR Digest) (h : Satisfies compress circuit root member) :
    MemberOf compress root member :=
  merkle_sound compress root member circuit h

/-- **`blindedset_complete` (the `←` half).** A genuine authorized member has a satisfying
blinded-membership trace (`merkle_complete` builds it from the path). -/
theorem blindedset_complete (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest) (root member : Digest)
    (h : MemberOf compress root member) :
    ∃ circuit : CircuitIR Digest, Satisfies compress circuit root member :=
  merkle_complete compress root member h

/-- **`blindedset_bridge`** — the blinded-set AIR's satisfiability is exactly issuer-set
membership: a satisfying trace proves the holder is authorized (`blindedset_sound`), and every
authorized member has a satisfying trace (`blindedset_complete`). This is `merkle_bridge` reused
both directions — no primitive seam. Blinding lives in the dial floor (holder anonymity), not here;
`compress` CR is consumed by `blindedset_verify_sound`'s `extractable`, never by the bridge. -/
theorem blindedset_bridge (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest) (root member : Digest) :
    (∃ circuit : CircuitIR Digest, Satisfies compress circuit root member)
      ↔ MemberOf compress root member :=
  merkle_bridge compress root member

-- Tripwires: both bridge directions rest only on `merkle_bridge` — no primitive seam.

/-! ## Holder anonymity — the blinding obligation, as an honest indistinguishability carrier.

This is what makes a BlindedSet proof MORE private than a bare Merkle membership: the verifier
learns "this holder is in the issuer's set" but NOT WHICH member. We carry it exactly as
`Privacy.blinded_membership_hides_element` does — the verifier-visible `view` of two authorized
members is computationally INDISTINGUISHABLE. It is a `Prop` carrier (the ZK simulator/advantage
obligation, a circuit obligation per §8), NEVER discharged by exhibiting a witness pair. -/

/-- **`HolderAnonymity`** — the blinded-set anonymity carriers + law, bundled as a class (the
`CryptoKernel.lean`/`BlindedMembershipKernel` idiom). `view member` is everything the verifier
learns from a blinded proof of `member` (the issuer root + the blinded transcript — by design it
leaks nothing about which member); `ViewIndistinguishable` is the advantage bound. The LAW: two
authorized members of the SAME issuer root have indistinguishable views. A lawful instance is the
circuit/ZK discharge (§8); `Reference` exhibits one, making the law non-vacuous. -/
class HolderAnonymity (Digest : Type u) where
  /-- The issuer's authorized-set Merkle commitment (the public root). -/
  compress : Digest → Digest → Digest
  /-- The verifier-visible view of a blinded membership proof of `member` at `root` (the root +
  blinded transcript). The point: it is independent of WHICH member, hiding the holder. -/
  view : Digest → Digest → Nat
  /-- Computational indistinguishability of two blinded views (the ZK advantage bound). -/
  ViewIndistinguishable : Nat → Nat → Prop
  /-- **LAW — holder anonymity**: two authorized members of the same issuer root produce
  indistinguishable blinded views, so a verifier confirms "authorized" while learning nothing
  about WHICH holder. (Hiding advantage bound; circuit obligation §8 — never an exhibited pair.) -/
  hides_law : ∀ (root m m' : Digest),
    MemberOf compress root m → MemberOf compress root m' →
    ViewIndistinguishable (view m root) (view m' root)

/-- **`blindedset_hides_holder` — holder anonymity, de-vacuified.** Given two GENUINE authorized
members `m`, `m'` of the same issuer `root`, their blinded views are indistinguishable: the
verifier learns "a holder is authorized" but NOT which one. Body is the kernel's `hides_law`
FIELD — non-vacuous (witnessed by `Reference`), NOT `sorry`. The analog of
`Privacy.blinded_membership_hides_element` for the issuer-set kind. -/

/-! ## Layer B — the blinded-set `VerifierKernel`: `verify` + carriers + DERIVED `verify_sound`.

Mirrors `MerkleVerifierKernel`. `verify` is the §8 oracle over the disclosed `(root, blinded_leaf)`;
`extractable` (STARK soundness + `compress` CR) gives "accept ⇒ a satisfying membership trace
against the issuer root exists"; `blindedset_verify_sound` is DERIVED off the bridge's soundness
half. The blinding does not enter soundness — it is the anonymity floor (above). -/

/-- **The disclosed blinded-set statement** — the public inputs the verifier sees: the issuer's
authorized-set Merkle root and the BLINDED member key (`blinded_leaf = hash_fact(leaf,[blinding])`,
`membership.rs:234`). The cleartext member is HIDDEN; `compress` CR binds the proof to the root. -/

  /-- The issuer's authorized-set Poseidon2 commitment (public). -/

  /-- The blinded member key proved authorized (public; hides which member). -/
  blindedMember : Digest

/-- **Layer B — the blinded-set `VerifierKernel`.** The `compress` primitive, the §8 `verify`
oracle over the disclosed `(root, blindedMember)`, and the STARK `extractable` carrier. `extract`
unpacks `extractable`: an accepted proof witnesses a satisfying membership trace against the
issuer root for SOME member key — the existence FRI/Fiat-Shamir + `compress`-CR soundness
delivers (the cleartext member stays hidden; the bridge needs only that SOME path exists). -/
class BlindedSetVerifierKernel (Digest : Type u) (Proof : Type u) where
  /-- The abstract Poseidon2 node hash (the Layer-A `compress`; CR is `collisionHard`). -/
  compress : Digest → Digest → Digest
  /-- **The §8 verify oracle** (`stark::verify` for the blinded membership AIR): does `proof`
  discharge the disclosed `(root, blindedMember)`? An opaque `Bool`; soundness is `extractable`. -/
  verify : Statement Digest → Proof → Bool
  /-- **CARRIER — STARK extractability/soundness** (FRI + Fiat-Shamir + `compress` CR binding the
  proof to the issuer root): accept ⇒ a satisfying membership trace for some member exists. A
  `Prop`; never proved, never `sorry`. -/
  extractable : Prop
  /-- `extractable` UNPACKED: an accepted proof witnesses a satisfying Merkle membership trace
  against the issuer root for SOME member key (the cleartext member is hidden by the blinding —
  the existential is exactly what the holder-anonymity buys). The form the bridge composes with. -/

      ∃ (member : Digest) (circuit : CircuitIR Digest),
        Satisfies compress circuit stmt.root member

variable {Proof : Type u}

/-- **`blindedset_verify_sound`** — given the STARK-soundness carrier `extractable`, an accepted
blinded-set proof proves some member is in the issuer's authorized set:
`verify stmt proof = true  →  ∃ member, MemberOf compress stmt.root member`.
Derived by composing `extract` with `blindedset_bridge`'s soundness half; never assumed. The member
stays existentially hidden, which is the holder anonymity the dial floor records. -/

/-! ## Layer C — the kind obligation + the DIAL wiring at the `acceptanceOnly` floor.

Blinded issuer-set membership discloses ONE bit ("this holder is authorized") and HIDES which
member (holder anonymity) — the zero-knowledge floor, like blinded Merkle membership. So the
epistemic floor is `acceptanceOnly` (NOT `selective`): the verifier learns only authorization,
nothing about the holder. We wire `EpistemicDial.DiscloseAt` to the verifier exactly as
`PredicateKernel` does for Merkle. -/
