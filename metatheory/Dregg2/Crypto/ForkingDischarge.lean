# `Dregg2.Crypto.ForkingDischarge` — RETIRING the deterministic forking-extractor hypothesis.

The crypto tree's protocol layer rests on ONE keystone, `HybridCombiner.hybrid_secure_if_either_floor`,
and that keystone TAKES two un-discharged reduction hypotheses:

  * `dlFork  : Forgery Cl pkc Q → SchnorrCurveField.DLSolver C G`
  * `msisFork : Forgery Pq pkp Q → ∃ w c c' z z', c ≠ c' ∧ IsSelfTargetMSISSolution … ∧ …`

and so do `pq_euf_cma_grounded_in_msis`, `DreggPqRefinement.dregg_pq_is_eufcma_under_msis` (the DEPLOYED
refinement) and `TurnAuthSignature.ForkingExtractor` — passed straight through by every protocol consumer
(`CapabilityChain`, `DowngradeResistance`, `RevocationSoundness`, `TurnSoundness`, `BlocklaceSafety`,
`ConsensusSafety`, `LightClientSoundness`, `WireAke`, `DualSchemeAuthority`, `UcSignature`). The prose in
each cites "the PROVED forking machinery of `HermineTSUF`", but `#assert_axioms` never sees a hypothesis:
the citation was never wired.

## Why the deterministic shape cannot be discharged — proved, not asserted

`HybridCombiner.Forgery S pk Q = ∃ m σ, ¬ Q m ∧ S.verify pk m σ` is a BARE existential witness: ONE
message, ONE signature, no algorithm, nothing to rewind. Rewinding is intrinsically probabilistic, and
`no_forked_pair_of_hits_le_one` PROVES the obstruction in the tree's own counting model: an adversary with
at most ONE accepting challenge per prefix has `forkProb = 0` and admits NO two-transcript event, so no
extraction is available at any hardness floor. A deterministic `Forgery` is exactly that adversary. The
hypothesis `fork : Forgery S pk Q → …` is therefore not merely un-discharged; in the stated model it is
un-DISCHARGEABLE. Fabricating a deterministic extractor would be laundering.

## What this file does instead — the bridge, and the honest residual

**§1 THE BRIDGE.** `ProbGameForger S pk Q A t β Ω` is the missing object: a probabilistic EUF-CMA adversary
in the finite forking model — a prefix world `Ω` fixing the ML-DSA commitment `comm ω` BEFORE the
Fiat–Shamir challenge, a response `resp ω c`, an accept predicate `acc`, and TWO soundness fields tying it
to both worlds at once:

  * `acc_wins`  — an accepting outcome IS an EUF-CMA win (a genuine `HybridCombiner.Forgery`);  ← GAME side
  * `acc_sound` — an accepting outcome IS an `IsSelfTargetMSISSolution` on the shared `comm ω`. ← FORKING side

`toProbForger` is the map into `HermineTSUF.ProbForger` (it is exactly the `acc_sound` field), so the whole
PROVED forking apparatus applies verbatim.

**§2 THE FORKING, DISCHARGED.** `forkPair_of_advantage` DERIVES the `msisFork` hypothesis' EXACT conclusion —
`∃ w c c' z z', c ≠ c' ∧ IsSelfTargetMSISSolution A t β z c w ∧ IsSelfTargetMSISSolution A t β z' c' w` —
from an advantage exceeding the challenge-guessing floor `1/|Rq|`, through `forkProb_ge_advantage` (the
PROVED Cauchy–Schwarz counting inequality), `forkProb_pos_of_advantage` and
`exists_forked_pair_of_forkProb_pos`. No hypothesis. `pq_advantage_bounded_under_msis` is the keystone in
the honest, advantage-bounded form: under `MSISHard`, EVERY probabilistic game forger's advantage is at most
`1/|Rq|` — the guessing floor, nothing more.

**§3 THE ONE RESIDUAL — `ForgeryRealizable`.** To keep the ~18 consumers' DETERMINISTIC conclusion
(`EufCma := ¬ Forgery`) we still need to cross from the bare `∃`-witness to an adversary. That crossing is
`ForgeryRealizable`: *if a forgery exists, it is produced by a probabilistic forking adversary of noticeable
advantage.* This is a MODELLING statement (the abstract `∃` is realized by an algorithm) — it assumes
NOTHING cryptographic. Everything cryptographic — the rewind, the shared commitment, the distinct
challenges, the MSIS/DL extraction — is PROVED downstream of it. Compare what it replaces: `msisFork`
assumed the entire extraction outright. `fork_of_realizable` derives `msisFork` from `ForgeryRealizable` +
the proved bound, so every consumer that took `msisFork` can now be fed a PROOF TERM.

**§4 THE CLASSICAL LEG.** `ProbSchnorrForger` is the mirror over the scalar field. `SchnorrEufCma`'s
`SchnorrForgeryFamily` carries `accepts_rewind` as an ASSUMED FIELD — the second transcript, hypothesized.
Here it is DERIVED: `prob_schnorr_yields_dlog` obtains the fork from the advantage, so
`no_prob_schnorr_family_under_dl` needs no assumed rewind. The floor is `SchnorrEufCma.SchnorrDLHardF`, the
field-scalar discrete-log assumption already in the tree.

**§5 THE KEYSTONES, RESTATED.** `hybrid_secure_if_either_floor_discharged` — `EufCma (hybrid Cl Pq)` under
`SchnorrDLHardF ∨ MSISHard`, with NO `dlFork` and NO `msisFork`; and
`dregg_pq_is_eufcma_under_msis_discharged` — the DEPLOYED `dregg-pq` ML-DSA refinement on `MSISHard` alone.

**§6 THE QUANTITATIVE KEYSTONE.** `GameForkingFamily` welds the game predicate to
`ProbCrypto.ForkingFamily`, so `game_forger_negl_under_msis_quant` gives the ensemble-level statement the
quant track already proves: `MSISHardQuantShape` + a growing challenge space ⟹ the game forger's advantage
ENSEMBLE is negligible.

**§7 TEETH.** The obstruction is proved (`no_forked_pair_of_hits_le_one`); the derived fork FIRES on a
concrete `ZMod 5` adversary of advantage `2/5 > 1/5`; and `keystone_msis_floor_load_bearing` shows the
discharged keystone is NON-VACUOUS and its floor LOAD-BEARING — `brokenToy` verifies everything (so `EufCma`
is FALSE) and our realizability bridge HOLDS for it, hence the keystone FORCES `¬ MSISHard` on the toy
instance, which is indeed easy. The floor is exactly what carries the conclusion.

/-! ## §0 — The obstruction, PROVED: a single-transcript adversary cannot be forked.

Before building anything, we prove why the deterministic shape is the wrong one. In the tree's own finite
counting model, an adversary with at most ONE accepting challenge per prefix world admits NO
distinct-challenge accepting pair — so `forkProb = 0` and there is nothing to extract, at any floor. A
deterministic `Forgery` (one message, one signature) IS such an adversary. This is the formal content of
"rewinding is intrinsically probabilistic". -/

extraction — no matter how hard the underlying problem is. The `fork` hypothesis cannot be discharged in

/-! ## §1 — THE BRIDGE: an EUF-CMA game adversary, in the forking model.

`ProbGameForger` is the object `HybridCombiner.Forgery` lacked. It lives in BOTH worlds at once: its
acceptance is an EUF-CMA win (`acc_wins`, so it produces genuine `Forgery` witnesses) AND an ML-DSA
verification equation (`acc_sound`, so it is a `HermineTSUF.ProbForger`). The map `toProbForger` is the
bridge — quite literally the `acc_sound` field — and it makes the PROVED forking bound apply to the GAME. -/

with signing transcript `Q`, presented in the finite forking model of `HermineTSUF`:

* `Ω` — the prefix world: the adversary's coins ⊕ the random-oracle answers STRICTLY BELOW its fixed
  forgery-challenge index. This is what fixes the commitment before the challenge is drawn.
* `comm ω` — the ML-DSA commitment `w`, a function of the prefix ALONE (so the two rewound runs share it).
* `resp ω c` — the response `z`.
* `out ω c` — the candidate forgery `(m, σ)` the adversary submits to the game.
* `acc ω c` — the accept predicate: the forger's win event.

and the two soundness fields, which are what make it a bridge:

* `acc_wins` — **the GAME leg**: an accepting outcome IS an EUF-CMA win, a fresh message with a verifying
  signature. So the adversary genuinely produces `HybridCombiner.Forgery` witnesses.
* `acc_sound` — **the FORKING leg**: an accepting outcome IS a genuine `IsSelfTargetMSISSolution` on the
  prefix-fixed commitment `comm ω` with challenge `c` (the ML-DSA verification equation, exactly the shape
  `HermineSelfTargetMSIS.selftarget_extract_nonzero` consumes).

Nothing here is a hardness assumption: both fields are properties a CONCRETE scheme's verifier satisfies. -/

`forkPair_of_advantage` produces, with NO hypothesis, exactly the conclusion the `msisFork` hypothesis used
to assume. The chain is entirely proved: advantage `> 1/|Rq|` ⟹ `forkProb > 0`
(`forkProb_pos_of_advantage`, from the Cauchy–Schwarz bound `forkProb_ge_advantage`) ⟹ two distinct-challenge
accepting outcomes on a SHARED prefix (`exists_forked_pair_of_forkProb_pos`) ⟹ two SelfTargetMSIS solutions
on the SHARED commitment (`acc_sound`). -/

/-- **THE `msisFork` HYPOTHESIS, PROVED.** A game adversary whose advantage exceeds the challenge-guessing
floor `1/|Rq|` YIELDS two SelfTargetMSIS solutions on a shared commitment with DISTINCT challenges — the
EXACT conclusion `HybridCombiner.pq_euf_cma_grounded_in_msis` took as its `fork` hypothesis. Nothing is
assumed: the two transcripts are derived from the probability being positive. -/

floor, EVERY probabilistic game forger against the scheme has advantage at most `1/|Rq|`: it can do no

The consumers conclude `EufCma := ¬ Forgery`, a DETERMINISTIC proposition about a bare `∃`-witness. Crossing
from that witness to an adversary is the one thing the probabilistic machinery cannot do for free — and it is
the ONLY thing left. `ForgeryRealizable` names it precisely and assumes nothing cryptographic. -/

/-- **`ForgeryRealizable` — THE SINGLE RESIDUAL MODELLING BRIDGE.** If the abstract game admits a `Forgery`
at all, that forgery is REALIZED by a probabilistic forking adversary of noticeable advantage (better than
guessing the challenge).

This is a statement about the MODEL, not about cryptography: it says the game's bare `∃ m σ` witness comes
from an actual algorithm with a prefix world and a rewindable challenge — the thing an abstract existential
quietly drops. It assumes NO extraction, NO rewind success, NO hardness. Everything cryptographic is proved
below it: `fork_of_realizable` DERIVES the reduction that `msisFork` used to assume outright.

Contrast the retired hypothesis, `msisFork : Forgery S pk Q → ∃ w c c' z z', c ≠ c' ∧ STMSIS ∧ STMSIS` —
that assumed the entire forking extraction, the whole cryptographic content, by fiat. -/

`hybrid_secure_if_either_floor` with BOTH forking hypotheses retired. The combiner itself

The hybrid `ed25519 × ML-DSA` signature is EUF-CMA-unforgeable if EITHER the discrete-log floor
`SchnorrDLHardF` OR the Module-SIS floor `MSISHard` holds. Compare the original
(`HybridCombiner.hybrid_secure_if_either_floor`), which additionally TOOK `dlFork` and `msisFork` — the two
un-discharged forking reductions — and passed them through to every consumer.

Here both are gone. What remains is: the two floors (irreducible, as they must be), and the two
REALIZABILITY bridges — modelling statements saying the game's bare `∃`-forgery is produced by an actual
adversary. Every cryptographic step (rewind, shared commitment/nonce, distinct challenges, MSIS/DL
extraction) is PROVED. -/

/-! ## §6 — THE QUANTITATIVE KEYSTONE.

`ProbCrypto.ForkingFamily` already carries the honest λ-indexed forking bound end-to-end (its `bound` field
is the ℝ-cast of `forkProb_ge_advantage`). What it lacked was the GAME leg. `GameForkingFamily` welds them:
a forking family whose every accepting outcome is a genuine `HybridCombiner.Forgery`. The quantitative
keystone is then the ensemble statement the quant track proves — `MSISHardQuantShape` + a growing challenge space
⟹ the game forger's advantage ENSEMBLE is negligible. -/

section Quant

/-! ## §7 — TEETH.

(a) THE OBSTRUCTION IS REAL: a single-transcript adversary has `forkProb = 0` and no forked pair — proved
    above, and exercised here on a concrete accept predicate.
(b) THE DERIVED FORK FIRES: a concrete `ZMod 5` game adversary of advantage `2/5 > 1/5 = 1/|C|` produces the
    two distinct-challenge SelfTargetMSIS solutions, with nothing assumed.
(c) THE DISCHARGED KEYSTONE IS NON-VACUOUS AND ITS FLOOR LOAD-BEARING: `brokenToy` verifies everything, so a
    `Forgery` EXISTS and `EufCma` is FALSE; our realizability bridge HOLDS for it; therefore the discharged
    keystone FORCES `¬ MSISHard` on the toy instance — and the toy instance is indeed easy. The MSIS floor is
    exactly what carries the conclusion; strip it and the keystone breaks.
(d) THE CLASSICAL LEG FIRES: a probabilistic Schnorr forger family over `ZMod 5` (where DL is easy) yields a
    `DLSolverF`, refuting `SchnorrDLHardF` — the classical mirror, with the rewind DERIVED. -/

/-- Exactly one accepting challenge. -/
theorem singleAcc_hits : hits singleAcc () = 1 := by decide

/-- **THE OBSTRUCTION FIRES.** The single-transcript adversary admits NO forked pair — so no extraction is
available from it at ANY hardness floor. This is why the deterministic `fork` hypothesis had to be
restated rather than proved. -/

/-! ### (b) The derived fork FIRES on a concrete game adversary. -/

/-- A concrete probabilistic GAME adversary over `ZMod 5`, against the `brokenToy` scheme (which verifies
everything, so every submission is a game win): commitment `0`, response `resp _ c = c`, accepting on
exactly the two challenges `{1, 2}` — advantage `2/5`, above the guessing floor `1/5`. Its `acc_sound` is
the SAME `IsSelfTargetMSISSolution` proof `HermineTSUF.exProbForger` carries, so it is a genuine bridge
object, not a relabel. -/

/-- **THE FLOOR IS LOAD-BEARING — proved THROUGH the discharged keystone.** `brokenToy` verifies everything,
so `Forgery brokenToy () noQueries` HOLDS (`HybridCombiner.brokenToy_forgeable`) and `EufCma` is FALSE. Our
realizability bridge HOLDS for it. So the discharged keystone, applied to the toy, FORCES `¬ MSISHard` on the
toy instance `[id | 1]` over `ZMod 5`. And it is indeed false there (the `2/5` adversary extracts a
solution). Hence: the keystone genuinely CONSUMES its Module-SIS floor — it is not a vacuous relabel, and
stripping the floor breaks the conclusion. -/
