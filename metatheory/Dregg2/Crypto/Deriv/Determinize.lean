# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.Determinize — Stage 4: the derivative automaton AS a `DfaAccepts` run.

The design §3 chains three edges into "the compiled boolean semantics is trusted":
  Edge A (Stage 1 `correctness`)  ∘  Edge B (this file + Stage 3)  ∘  Edge C (`Dfa.lean dfa_bridge`).

Edge C — the in-circuit `Dfa.lean` — consumes a TABLE-OPAQUE automaton: `DfaAccepts δ q₀ accept trace`
over an ABSTRACT `δ : State → Sym → State → Prop`, `accept : State → Prop`. It does not care HOW the
table was built (the AIR is table-opaque, design §3.2). So to connect dregg's derivative matcher to
the deployed AIR it suffices to exhibit the DERIVATIVE AUTOMATON in exactly that `DfaAccepts` shape
and prove it accepts EXACTLY `derives` — UP TO LANGUAGE, which is all the table-opaque AIR needs.

That is what this file does, kernel-clean:

  * the derivative automaton: `State := PredRE`, `Sym := Value`, `δ := derStep` (`s' = der a s`),
    `accept := nullAccept` (`null s = true`);
  * `runTrace R w` — the canonical accepting run threading `der` along `w` (one `Step` per frame);
  * **`derivativeDfa_correct`**: for a non-empty word, the `Dfa.lean`-shaped run `DfaAccepts derStep R
    nullAccept (runTrace R w)` holds IFF `derives w R = true` — the SAME `DfaAccepts` predicate the
    deployed AIR's accepting bit certifies (`Dfa.lean:66`).

Chaining with Stage 1 (`correctness`) and Stage 3's `sim_sound`, this gives: the run the AIR accepts
recognizes EXACTLY the denotational language `Matches`. The in-circuit `Dfa.lean` cascade is UNTOUCHED
(we IMPORT its `DfaAccepts`/`Step`/`dfa_bridge`, we do not edit them).

What is NOT here — `derivativeCompile_eq_tableDfa` against `compiler.rs`'s POWERSET `determinize`: that
needs `der_finite` (Stage 3's combinatorial wall) to know the derivative automaton has finitely many
states before a finite table can be EQUAL (up to a reachable-state bijection) to the powerset table.
Named precisely in the closing note; NOT closed with `sorry`.

`#assert_axioms`-clean, `sorry`-free.

/-! ## The derivative automaton — states `PredRE`, transition `der`, accept `null`. -/

/-- **`derStep`** — the transition relation of the derivative automaton: from state `s`, reading
frame `a`, the (deterministic) next state is `der a s`. This IS dregg's `der` viewed as the DFA `δ`
the deployed `Lookup` table would route. -/
def derStep (s : PredRE) (a : Value) (s' : PredRE) : Prop := s' = der a s

/-- **`nullAccept`** — the accepting predicate of the derivative automaton: a state accepts iff its
regex is nullable. This IS dregg's `null` viewed as the DFA accept set. -/
def nullAccept (s : PredRE) : Prop := null s = true

/-- **`runTrace R w`** — the canonical run of the derivative automaton on word `w` from start state
`R`: one `Step` per frame, threading `der`. The `i`-th step is `(Rᵢ, aᵢ, der aᵢ Rᵢ)` where `R₀ = R`
and `Rᵢ₊₁ = der aᵢ Rᵢ`. -/

/-- The first step starts in state `R` (for a non-empty word). -/
theorem runTrace_head (R : PredRE) (a : Value) (as : List Value) :
    (runTrace R (a :: as)).head? = some ⟨R, a, der a R⟩ := rfl

/-! ## `derivativeDfa_correct` — the run is accepted by the `DfaAccepts` predicate iff `derives`. -/

/-- **`derivativeDfa_correct`** — for a NON-EMPTY word, the derivative automaton's canonical run is a
valid accepting run (the EXACT `Dfa.lean` `DfaAccepts` predicate the deployed AIR certifies, `Dfa.lean:
66`) IFF the derivative matcher accepts the word. This is the design §3.2 step-2 (`derivativeDfa_correct`):
"running the DFA = iterating `der`," transported cleanly off Stages 0–1. The non-empty restriction is
because `DfaAccepts` requires a non-empty trace (≥1 transition); the empty-word case is the pure
boundary `derives [] R = null R`, handled by `Dfa.lean`'s boundary `PiBinding` directly. -/

/-- **`derivativeDfa_matches`** — chaining `derivativeDfa_correct` with Stage 1 `correctness`: the
`Dfa.lean`-shaped accepting run recognizes EXACTLY the denotational language `Matches`. This is the
end-to-end language identity "the run the AIR accepts = the spec language," for non-empty words. -/

    DfaAccepts derStep R nullAccept (runTrace R (a :: as)) ↔ Matches (a :: as) R := by

## The precise remaining wall for Stage 4 — NAMED, not closed.

`derivativeDfa_correct`/`_matches` above close the LANGUAGE-LEVEL connection the table-opaque AIR
needs: the derivative automaton, presented in the EXACT `Dfa.lean` `DfaAccepts` shape, accepts
exactly `derives` = `Matches`. Chained with `Dfa.lean`'s `dfa_bridge` (Edge C) this already gives
"the AIR's accepting bit certifies the denotational language of the derivative automaton."

What remains is `derivativeCompile_eq_tableDfa` (design §3.1 Edge B's literal table equality): that
the derivative automaton's table EQUALS (up to a reachable-state bijection) the POWERSET table
`compiler.rs::determinize` emits. Its ONE prerequisite — finiteness of the derivative state space, so
that there IS a finite δ-table to compare — is NO LONGER A WALL: `Deriv.Finiteness.der_finite`
(Stage 3) proves the reachable derivatives are finite up to `≅`, kernel-clean. So the table-equality
half is now UNBLOCKED; what is left is purely a Lean MODEL of `compiler.rs::determinize`'s powerset
construction + a direct language-equivalence `derivativeDfa ≃ powersetDfa` (the design says
language/bisim equivalence SUFFICES for the table-opaque AIR — exactly the regime
`derivativeDfa_matches` already lives in). The cleanest close routes everything through the derivative
automaton as the single source of truth (the language identity is proven here; its finiteness is
proven in Stage 3) and reconciles the deployed powerset table by language-equivalence. NOT closed
with `sorry`.
