# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.SymbolicEmptiness — Tier 2 of the symbolic-VPA lift: the FIRST
user-visible symbolic decision, `∃ w, derives w R = true` (guarded-regular-language NONEMPTINESS)
over the INFINITE `Value` alphabet, decided by SAT-FILTERED derivative reachability.

Companion to `docs/DESIGN-symbolic-vpa-lift.md` §5 tier 2. Registered in `Dregg2.lean`. Builds on tier 0 (`SatOracle.lean`: `PredSat`, the deployed minterm witnesses)
and the derivative tower (`Core`/`Correctness`/`Finiteness`/`SymbolicDerivative`).

## The over-approximation `step` cannot decide emptiness — and the fix

`SymbolicDerivative.step r = leaves (𝜕 r)` collects EVERY leaf of the symbolic derivative,
IGNORING branch conditions. It is a sat-FREE over-approximation: a residual is listed even when the
branch leading to it is satisfied by NO `Value`. Harmless for finiteness (a finite superset is still
finite); FATAL for emptiness — deciding `∃ w, derives w R` as "some `null`-state is `step`-reachable"
is UNSOUND, reporting words no `Value` sequence realizes.

Two obstructions to naive sat-filtering of `𝜕 r`, both discovered by reading the tower:

  1. `𝜕 r`'s node CONDITIONS are placeholders — `firstPred l := .tt` (`SymbolicDerivative.lean:30`)
     for the `cat` split, which concretely branches on the frame-INDEPENDENT `null l`, not on any
     `Value`. So the symbolic conditions do NOT faithfully encode when `der a r` selects a leaf;
     filtering `𝜕 r`'s leaves by their own branch predicate is unsound for `cat`/`star`.
  2. The branch of a leaf is a CONJUNCTION (a minterm) of the leaf predicates on its path, and tier 0
     only decides single-leaf `PredSat`, not minterms.

The SOUND realization sidesteps both by filtering CONSTRUCTIVELY: take the concrete derivatives
`der a r` under the deployed minterm WITNESSES `candidates = [braceVal, dataVal]` (the two frames
that realize `braceP` / `¬braceP`, from tier 0). Every residual is then `der a r` for a REAL
`a : Value` — SOUNDNESS is BY CONSTRUCTION (no placeholder condition, no minterm oracle), and the
candidate frames ARE the accepting witness word. This is exactly "keep a residual iff SOME deployed
minterm-witness realizes it" = sat-filtering by `PredSat`, realized so the witness is in hand.

## What is decided, and what is the residual (scoped HONESTLY)

* `satStep` (the sat-filtered step) + `reachableWithin`/`nonemptyWithin` (bounded reachability) —
  COMPUTE (kernel `#guard`).
* Decision SOUNDNESS is a real theorem: `nonemptyWithin n R = true → ∃ w, derives w R = true`
  (and via `correctness`, `→ ∃ w, Matches w R`). The witness word is the candidate frames on the
  accepting path.
* The UNSAT canary BITES: a contradictory `R` (`sym braceP ⋒ sym ¬braceP`, and `bot = sym .ff`)
  decides NONEMPTY = FALSE by kernel eval, whereas the sat-FREE `step` reaches a NULLABLE residual
  (`inter ε ε` / `ε`) via a branch no `Value` takes and would WRONGLY call it nonempty.

WHAT IS PROVED (no `sorry`, no laundered `em`, no `native_decide`):
  * the sat-filtered step (`satStep`, via the deployed minterm witnesses) + `nonemptyWithin`;
  * SOUNDNESS (`nonemptyWithin_sound`): a `true` verdict yields a REAL accepting `Value` word;
  * the leaf-factoring `der_factors` — for a DEPLOYED `R`, `der a R` depends on `a` ONLY through
    `leaf braceP a` (two minterm classes), which `candidates` covers (`canonicalWitness`);
  * BOUNDED COMPLETENESS and hence the BOTH-DIRECTIONS bounded decision
    (`nonemptyWithin_iff_bounded`: `nonemptyWithin n R = true ↔ ∃ w, |w| ≤ n ∧ derives w R = true`)
    and a genuine `boundedNonemptyDecidable : Decidable (∃ w, |w| ≤ n ∧ derives w R = true)`;
  * the biting UNSAT canary (a sat-FREE step would call `contradictionRE` nonempty; this does not).

⚠ WHAT IS **NOT** PROVED (stated exactly, so the bounded result is not mistaken for the full one):
the UNBOUNDED decision `Decidable (∃ w, derives w R = true)` — i.e. `nonemptyWithin n R = false →
¬∃ w, derives w R` for words of ANY length. The contrapositive of `nonemptyWithin_iff_bounded`
gives only "no accepting word of length `≤ n`"; it says NOTHING about longer words. Closing it needs
THREE unbanked ingredients (the earlier "`der_finite` + `DecidableEq PredRE`" recipe is INSUFFICIENT):
  (a) a DECIDABLE similarity `≅` (or an ACI normalizer). Plain `DecidableEq PredRE` will NOT
      terminate a fixpoint: `der a (star r) = cat (der a r) (star r)` grows the SYNTACTIC state set
      without bound even though the `≅`-quotient is finite. No `Decidable`/`DecidableRel` instance
      for `Sim` exists anywhere under `Dregg2/Crypto/Deriv/`.
  (b) a BRIDGE from `satStep`/`der`-reachability into `Finiteness.der_finite`'s `steps` — `der_finite`
      bounds the sat-FREE symbolic `step`, not the concrete `der` reachability used here, and the
      `step ↔ der` relation is not banked.
  (c) pigeonhole excision (an accepting word implies one of length `< N`, the finite `≅`-class count).
      STILL OPEN. Its two SUPPORTING lemmas are now BANKED in `Similarity.lean`: `≅`-invariance of
      `null` (`PredRE.sim_null`) and the `der`-congruence `Sim R S → Sim (der a R) (der a S)`
      (`PredRE.sim_der`), iterated along a word by `PredRE.sim_derList`. So `der` is now known to
      descend to the `≅`-quotient; what (c) still lacks is the pigeonhole/counting step itself.

/-! ## §1 The deployed minterm witnesses and the sat-filtered step. -/

/-- **`candidates`** — the deployed guard leaf algebra's minterm WITNESSES: `braceVal` realizes the
`braceP` minterm and `dataVal` realizes `¬braceP` (tier 0, `SatOracle.predSat_braceP` /
`predSat_not_braceP`; `leaf_braceP_brace`/`leaf_braceP_data`). Every frame the deployed guards can
distinguish is `≈` one of these two, so concrete derivatives under `candidates` capture the whole
sat-filtered fan-out of the deployed fragment. -/
def candidates : List Value := [braceVal, dataVal]

/-- **`satStep r`** — the SAT-filtered derivative step, realized CONSTRUCTIVELY: the concrete
derivatives of `r` under the deployed minterm witnesses. Contrast `step r = leaves (𝜕 r)`, which
lists residuals reachable only via UNSAT branches: here every residual is `der a r` for a REAL
`a ∈ candidates`, so it is genuinely reachable (soundness by construction) and `a` is a witness. -/
def satStep (r : PredRE) : List PredRE := candidates.map (fun a => der a r)

/-- The candidate frames genuinely realize the two deployed minterms (tier-0 witnesses): the
`braceP` branch is taken by `braceVal`, the `¬braceP` branch by `dataVal`. This is "each satStep
edge's branch is `PredSat`", made concrete — the soundness ingredient, exhibited. -/
theorem candidate_minterm_witnesses :
    leaf braceP braceVal = true ∧ leaf braceP dataVal = false :=
  ⟨leaf_braceP_brace, leaf_braceP_data⟩

/-! ## §2 `derList` — the concrete derivative along a word (the accepting-path re-executor).

`derList` and `derives_eq_null_derList` are DEFINED ONCE, in the lower `Similarity.lean`
(`PredRE` namespace), and opened above — this module previously carried byte-identical copies,
which survived only because the two sat in different namespaces. Only `derList_append`, which
`Similarity` does not carry, lives here. -/

/-! ## §3 Bounded sat-filtered reachability + the decision function. -/

/-- **`reachableWithin n R`** — every residual reachable from `R` by at most `n` sat-filtered steps.
Structurally terminating on `n`; `Finiteness.der_finite` bounds the `n` at which this saturates
(residual C2 — the unbounded fixpoint). -/
def reachableWithin : Nat → PredRE → List PredRE
  | 0,          R => [R]
  | Nat.succ n, R => (reachableWithin n R).flatMap (fun s => s :: satStep s)

/-- **`nonemptyWithin n R`** — the DECISION (bounded): does some residual reachable from `R` within
`n` sat-filtered steps accept the empty word? When `true`, `R`'s language is genuinely nonempty
(`nonemptyWithin_sound`). Sat-FILTERED, so an accepting residual reachable only through an
unsatisfiable branch is NOT counted — unlike the sat-free `step`. -/
def nonemptyWithin (n : Nat) (R : PredRE) : Bool := (reachableWithin n R).any null

/-! ## §4 Decision SOUNDNESS — a `true` answer exhibits a real accepting word. -/

/-- Every sat-reachable residual is a concrete derivative `derList w R` for a real candidate word
`w` — soundness by construction, the candidate frames on the path forming the witness. -/
theorem reachableWithin_sound :
    ∀ {n : Nat} {R s : PredRE}, s ∈ reachableWithin n R → ∃ w, derList w R = s := by

      rw [derList_append]
      show der a (derList w R) = s
      rw [hw]; exact ha

/-- **`nonemptyWithin_sound`** — the DECISION IS SOUND: if the bounded sat-filtered search reports
nonempty, then `R`'s guarded regular language over the infinite `Value` alphabet genuinely contains
a word. The witness is the candidate frames along the accepting derivative path. -/
theorem nonemptyWithin_sound {n : Nat} {R : PredRE}

  obtain ⟨s, hs, hnull⟩ := h
  obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := reachableWithin_sound hs
  exact ⟨w, by rw [derives_eq_null_derList, hw]; exact hnull⟩

/-- **`nonemptyWithin_matches`** — the same, phrased on the DENOTATIONAL language via the verified
matcher `correctness` (`derives ↔ Matches`): a `true` decision exhibits a word in `{ w | Matches w R }`. -/
theorem nonemptyWithin_matches {n : Nat} {R : PredRE}
    (h : nonemptyWithin n R = true) : ∃ w, Matches w R := by
  obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := nonemptyWithin_sound h
  exact ⟨w, (correctness w R).mp hw⟩

/-! ## §5 The UNSAT canary — the tell that the sat-filter does real work.

`contradictionRE` = "one frame that is BOTH a brace and not a brace" — empty (no `Value` satisfies
`braceP ∧ ¬braceP`). The sat-filtered decision returns FALSE; the sat-FREE `step` reaches the
NULLABLE residual `inter ε ε` (via the impossible conjunction) and would WRONGLY return true. -/

/-- `R⊥ := (sym braceP) ⋒ (sym ¬braceP)` — a single frame constrained to be a brace AND not a brace.
Genuinely empty. -/
def contradictionRE : PredRE := .inter (.sym braceP) (.sym (.not braceP))

section Canary

-- SAT: `sym braceP` accepts exactly `[braceVal]`. The decision computes NONEMPTY = TRUE — and only
-- because `braceVal` (a real deployed minterm witness) realizes the `braceP` branch.
#guard nonemptyWithin 1 (.sym braceP) = true

-- The `true` answer corresponds to a CONCRETE accepting word (the candidate frame), matched by the
-- verified denotation — no `decide` (which stalls on the `String` field compare), a direct witness.

-- UNSAT #1 (the contradiction): the sat-filtered decision correctly returns FALSE...
#guard nonemptyWithin 3 contradictionRE = false
-- ...while the sat-FREE `step` ALREADY reaches a NULLABLE residual (`inter ε ε`) at depth 1 — the
-- exact over-approximation bug: a nullable state reachable only via the branch `braceP ∧ ¬braceP`
-- that NO `Value` takes. This is the tell that sat-filtering is load-bearing.
#guard (step contradictionRE).any null = true

-- UNSAT #2 (`bot = sym .ff`): the leaf `.ff` fires on no frame, so the language is empty. The
-- sat-filtered decision returns FALSE...
#guard nonemptyWithin 2 bot = false
-- ...while sat-free `step bot = [ε, bot]` lists the NULLABLE `ε` (reachable only via the unsat `.ff`
-- branch) and would call `bot` nonempty.
#guard (step bot).any null = true

end Canary

/-! ## §6 The DEPLOYED fragment and its leaf-factoring — the load-bearing new content (C1).

The completeness residual `(C1)` hinges on a single structural fact: for the guards the templater
actually writes, `der a R` depends on the frame `a` ONLY through `leaf braceP a`. The deployed guard
leaf algebra is the boolean algebra GENERATED by the single atom `braceP` — its members are exactly
the predicates whose single-frame reading cannot distinguish two frames that `braceP` cannot
(`braceP`, `¬braceP`, `tt`, `ff`, and their boolean combinations). We capture that SEMANTICALLY as
`LeafDeployed`, then lift it structurally to `IsDeployed R`. This is strictly the deployed algebra of
tier 0 (`deployed_guard_minterms_decided`: the minterms are `braceP` / `¬braceP`), not a re-authored
peer. -/

/-- **`LeafDeployed φ`** — the leaf predicate `φ` reads a single frame ONLY through `leaf braceP`:
it gives the same verdict on any two frames that `braceP` cannot tell apart. This is EXACTLY the
condition under which `der a (.sym φ)` factors through the two deployed minterm classes, and it holds
for every member of the boolean algebra generated by `braceP` (the deployed guard leaf algebra). -/
def LeafDeployed (φ : Pred) : Prop :=
  ∀ a b : Value, leaf braceP a = leaf braceP b → leaf φ a = leaf φ b

/-- **`IsDeployed R`** — every `sym` leaf of `R` is `LeafDeployed`: `R` is a guard the deployed
templater fragment can write. Closed under all `PredRE` constructors (so `der` preserves it,
`der_deployed`). -/
def IsDeployed : PredRE → Prop
  | .ε         => True
  | .sym φ     => LeafDeployed φ
  | .alt l r   => IsDeployed l ∧ IsDeployed r

  | .star r    => IsDeployed r
  | .neg r     => IsDeployed r

/-- `leaf (.not p) a = !(leaf p a)` — `Pred.eval` on `.not` is Boolean negation (definitional). -/
theorem leaf_not (p : Pred) (a : Value) : leaf (.not p) a = !(leaf p a) := rfl

/-- `braceP` itself is `LeafDeployed` (trivially — it is the generating atom). -/
theorem leafDeployed_braceP : LeafDeployed braceP := fun _ _ h => h

/-- `¬braceP` is `LeafDeployed`: it reads `a` only through `leaf braceP a`, negated. -/
theorem leafDeployed_not_braceP : LeafDeployed (.not braceP) := fun a b h => by
  rw [leaf_not, leaf_not, h]

/-- `tt` is `LeafDeployed`: constantly `true`, so it distinguishes no frames. -/
theorem leafDeployed_tt : LeafDeployed .tt := fun _ _ _ => rfl

/-- `ff` is `LeafDeployed`: constantly `false`. -/
theorem leafDeployed_ff : LeafDeployed .ff := fun _ _ _ => rfl

/-- **`der_factors`** — the load-bearing structural factoring: for a DEPLOYED `R`, two frames that
`braceP` cannot distinguish (`leaf braceP a = leaf braceP b`) yield the SAME concrete derivative
`der a R = der b R`. Structural induction on `R`: the `sym` case is exactly `LeafDeployed`; every
other constructor recurses (the frame-independent `null l` guard of `cat` is untouched). This is
residual `(C1)`(i), discharged. -/
theorem der_factors {a b : Value} (hab : leaf braceP a = leaf braceP b) :
    ∀ {R : PredRE}, IsDeployed R → der a R = der b R := by

/-- **`der_deployed`** — the deployed fragment is CLOSED under `der`: the concrete derivative of a
deployed guard is again a deployed guard. So the whole reachable state space of a deployed `R` under
`der` stays deployed, and `der_factors` applies at every step (needed for `derList_factors`). -/

reports nonempty. The proof canonicalizes `w` (`derList_factors`) onto a candidate word the search

deployed guard: `∃ w, |w| ≤ n ∧ derives w R = true`. Decided by kernel evaluation of `nonemptyWithin`

section DeployedGuards

/-- `contradictionRE` is IN the deployed fragment (its leaves are `braceP` and `¬braceP`, both
`LeafDeployed`). So the biting `nonemptyWithin 3 contradictionRE = false` is not merely SOUND but,
via `nonemptyWithin_iff_bounded`, COMPLETE: no accepting word of length `≤ 3` exists. -/
example : IsDeployed contradictionRE := by
  simp only [contradictionRE, IsDeployed]
  exact ⟨leafDeployed_braceP, leafDeployed_not_braceP⟩

/-- `noDoubleBraceRE` — the actual deployed templater guard — is in the fragment (leaves `tt`, from
`star any`, and `braceP`). So the FULL bounded decision applies to the real guard. -/
example : IsDeployed noDoubleBraceRE := by
  simp only [noDoubleBraceRE, BB, PredRE.any, IsDeployed]
  exact ⟨leafDeployed_tt, leafDeployed_braceP, leafDeployed_braceP, leafDeployed_tt⟩

-- SAT: a deployed guard with a real accepting frame decides NONEMPTY = TRUE by kernel eval...
#guard nonemptyWithin 1 (.sym braceP) = true
-- ...and `noDoubleBraceRE` accepts `[]` (no adjacent braces), so it is nonempty at bound 0.
#guard nonemptyWithin 0 noDoubleBraceRE = true
-- UNSAT: the empty guards decide FALSE — now a COMPLETE verdict (both are deployed).
#guard nonemptyWithin 3 contradictionRE = false
#guard nonemptyWithin 2 bot = false

-- The bounded `Decidable` for the real guard `noDoubleBraceRE` is inhabited by a `true` verdict:
-- an accepting word of length `≤ 0` genuinely exists (the empty word), proven THROUGH the
-- both-directions bounded iff (not a bare soundness `⇒`).
example : ∃ w, w.length ≤ 0 ∧ derives w noDoubleBraceRE = true :=
  (nonemptyWithin_iff_bounded (n := 0) (R := noDoubleBraceRE) (by
    simp only [noDoubleBraceRE, BB, PredRE.any, IsDeployed]
    exact ⟨leafDeployed_tt, leafDeployed_braceP, leafDeployed_braceP, leafDeployed_tt⟩)).mp rfl
