# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.Similarity — Stage 3 foundation: the ACI similarity over `PredRE`,
# proven LANGUAGE-SOUND.

Brzozowski finiteness holds only UP TO SIMILARITY `≅` — the associativity / commutative-dedup /
idempotence (ACI) congruence on `alt`, which is what collapses the syntactically-infinite set of
derivatives to a finite quotient. The ITP'25 `finiteness-derivatives` proof (`Similarity.lean`)
defines exactly this `Sim` relation and quotients the state space by it.

This module ports `Sim` to `PredRE` AND proves the fact that licenses the quotient at all:
**similarity is LANGUAGE-SOUND** — `R ≅ S → (Matches w R ↔ Matches w S)` for every word `w`. Without
this, "finite up to `≅`" would be a quotient by a relation that does not respect the matched
language, and the finiteness would be vacuous/unsound (the `feedback-dont-launder-vacuity` discipline:
prove the quotient relation is the RIGHT one). With it, every `≅`-class is a genuine language class,
so a finite set of `≅`-classes IS a finite set of recognized languages.

This is the load-bearing SEMANTIC half of Stage 3. The remaining half — the COMBINATORIAL counting
(`pieces`/`neSubsets`/`toSum`: that `der a R` is `≅` a sum over a non-empty subset of the finite
`pieces R`) — is named as the precise wall in the module note at the bottom and in the report; it is
purely syntactic (no semantics) and is the ~2000-line `Permute`/`Pieces` development the design §3.3
rates months-scale.

It also carries the **DER-CONGRUENCE** `sim_der : R ≅ S → der a R ≅ der a S` (and its supporting
`sim_null : R ≅ S → null R = null S`, plus the word-iterated `sim_derList`). This is what makes `der`
WELL-DEFINED ON THE `≅`-QUOTIENT — the bounded ingredient (c) of `SymbolicEmptiness.lean`'s
unbounded-emptiness rung. It does NOT close that rung: the pigeonhole/counting step and a decidable
`≅` remain open there.

The der-congruence half is **SEMANTICS-FREE**: `sim_null`, `sim_der` and `sim_derList` are proved by
induction on the `Sim` derivation from the defining clauses of `null`/`der` alone, and `sim_null` is
placed BEFORE the language-soundness section so that independence holds by declaration order rather
than merely by assertion. Order alone is fragile (a later edit can cite a denotational lemma proved
in an earlier FILE and still build green), so the property is additionally pinned by
`#assert_not_depends_on` at the bottom of this module: the transitive proof-term closure of each
chain theorem is walked at build time and reaching `Matches`/`correctness`/`sim_sound`/`sim_derives`
is a hard ERROR. Consequently `sim_derives_syntactic` is a genuinely
independent route to the verdict-invariance that `sim_derives` gets denotationally. `sim_derives`
itself is unchanged and still denotational — the two are separate routes, not one rewritten.

`#assert_axioms`-clean, `sorry`-free.

/-- **`sim_null`** — `≅`-invariance of nullability, PROVED SYNTACTICALLY: induction on the `Sim`
derivation, discharging each case with `null`'s own defining clauses and Boolean algebra. NO appeal
to `Matches` / `correctness` / `sim_sound` / `sim_derives` — this lemma does not touch the
denotational tower at all.

Why it goes through: `null` is a homomorphism from the syntax into `Bool` (`alt ↦ ||`, `inter ↦ &&`,
`cat ↦ &&`, `neg ↦ !`, `ε`/`star ↦ true`, `sym ↦ false`), and every `Sim` law is a law that `||`
satisfies in `Bool` — `assoc` is `Bool.or_assoc`, `idem` is `b || b = b`, `dedup` is
`a || (b || a) = a || b`. So each case closes by case-splitting the finitely many `Bool`s. The
congruences transport their IHs through the corresponding Boolean operation; `catCong` only rewrites
the LEFT factor of a `cat`, and `null (cat l r) = null l && null r` is congruent in its left argument,
so it transports too. -/

/-! ## Language-soundness of `≅` — the fact that licenses the quotient.

`R ≅ S → ∀ w, Matches w R ↔ Matches w S`. Proven by induction on the `Sim` derivation; each ACI law
is a Boolean identity on the matched language (alt = ∪, so associativity/dedup/idempotence are the
∪-laws), and each congruence transports its premise's language-equality through the matching
denotation. This is the dregg-native analog of the (implicit) soundness ERE≤ relies on; we prove it
EXPLICITLY because it is the non-vacuity witness for the whole "up to `≅`" quotient. -/

/-! ## DER-CONGRUENCE — `≅` is preserved by the derivative.

`Sim` as defined above is a congruence for the SYNTAX constructors, but nothing in its definition
says the DERIVATIVE respects it. That is the ingredient every route to the `n`-free emptiness
decision needs: to search the `≅`-quotient state space one must know `der` is well-defined ON the
quotient, i.e. `R ≅ S → der a R ≅ der a S`.

The proof is structural induction on the `Sim` derivation. Every ACI law's `der`-image is an
instance of the SAME law (`der` distributes over `alt` verbatim), and every congruence transports
its IH. The one case with content is `catCong`: `der a (cat l r)` branches on `null l`, so the
congruence only goes through once we know `≅` preserves NULLABILITY — hence `sim_null` first. -/

/-- **`sim_der`** — THE der-congruence: similarity is preserved by the Brzozowski derivative, so
`der` descends to the `≅`-quotient. Structural induction on the `Sim` derivation; the `catCong`
case is the interesting one — it splits on the shared `null` value supplied by `sim_null`. -/

/-! ## Iterating the der-congruence along a whole word. -/

/-- **`derList w R`** — the derivative iterated along the word `w` (the state `derives` reaches
before its final `null` check). Exposed so the SYNTACTIC congruence below can be stated on the
regex itself, not only on the Boolean verdict. -/
@[simp] def derList : List Value → PredRE → PredRE
  | [],      R => R
  | a :: as, R => derList as (der a R)

/-- `derives` is `null ∘ derList` — the two agree by construction. -/
theorem derives_eq_null_derList (w : List Value) (R : PredRE) :
    derives w R = null (derList w R) := by
  induction w generalizing R with
  | nil => rfl
  | cons a as ih => simpa only [derives, derList] using ih (der a R)

/-- **`sim_derList`** — the der-congruence iterated: similar regexes stay similar after reading any
word. This is `sim_der` folded along `w`. -/
theorem sim_derList {R S : PredRE} (h : R ≅ S) (w : List Value) :
    derList w R ≅ derList w S := by
  induction w generalizing R S with
  | nil => exact h
  | cons a as ih => exact ih (sim_der h a)

/-- **`sim_derives_syntactic`** — `sim_derives` re-derived through the DERIVATIVE route: iterate
`sim_der` along the word, then apply `sim_null` at the end.

This route IS semantics-free, and the name is now earned. Its three ingredients — `sim_der`,
`sim_derList`, `sim_null` — are each proved by induction on the `Sim` derivation using only the
defining clauses of `null` and `der`; none of them mentions `Matches`, `correctness`, `sim_sound` or
`sim_derives`. The independence is pinned STRUCTURALLY, not just by inspection: `sim_null` is
declared ABOVE the language-soundness section in this file, so it typechecks in an environment where
`sim_sound`/`sim_derives` do not yet exist and therefore cannot appeal to them. Moving it back below
would be the mutation that detects a regression.

MEASURED, not asserted — and REPRODUCIBLY: walk the transitive constant-closure of each theorem's
proof term in the BUILT environment (`ConstantInfo.value?` with `allowOpaque := true`, which is
required for theorems; a probe that omits it, or that runs before `lake build Dregg2`, reads the
STALE olean and can report the opposite). Under that method, the closures of `sim_null`, `sim_der`,
`sim_derList` and `sim_derives_syntactic` contain NO occurrence of `Matches`, `correctness`,
`sim_sound` or `denote` — `sim_null`'s is `Sim.rec` + `null` + `Bool` operations + `Eq` plumbing and
nothing else — whereas the denotational `sim_derives` DOES close over the full `Matches`/`correctness`
block (roughly an order of magnitude larger). That gap is the independence. Exact constant COUNTS are
deliberately not quoted here: they drift with mathlib and with the probe's treatment of opaque
definitions, so a stale figure would read as precision it does not have; re-run the probe rather than
trusting a number in a comment.

Scope, precisely: this does NOT retroactively make `sim_derives` syntactic — that theorem is
unchanged and still goes through `sim_sound` → `correctness` → `Matches`, and it remains the
LANGUAGE-level statement (it is what licenses the `≅`-quotient as a quotient of recognized
languages). What is new is that a SECOND and genuinely independent route to the same *verdict*
equation now exists: the derivative route needs no denotational semantics at all. The two routes
agreeing is a TWO-GATES-PROVABLY-AGREE property of this file, not extra strength in either one. -/

/-! ## Semantics-freedom, CI-ENFORCED (not merely order-enforced).

Declaration order makes the der-congruence chain independent of the denotational tower at the moment
it is written; it does not KEEP it independent. A future edit could re-prove `sim_null` as
`simpa only [derives] using sim_derives h []` — semantically fine, axiom-clean, GREEN — and the
independence claim above would silently become false.

`#assert_not_depends_on` (Dregg2/Tactics.lean) makes that edit a BUILD ERROR: it walks the transitive
constant closure of each proof term (`ConstantInfo.value?`, `allowOpaque := true`) and errors, naming
the dependency path, if any of the denotational constants is reachable. This is the probe described in
the module header, promoted from a manual one-off to a standing gate. `sim_derives` is deliberately
NOT pinned — it is the denotational route, and pinning it would fail (correctly).

A rejector cannot detect its OWN blindness. The scanned-count once claimed that role and was
MEASURED FALSE: with `allowOpaque := false`, a deliberately semantic re-proof of `sim_null` was
reported `hit = none` at `scanned = 36` — the dependency MISSED, the count far above any tripwire,
because the root's TYPE constants are walked even when its VALUE is invisible. So the gate below
carries a POSITIVE CONTROL (`#assert_depends_on`, same walk): `sim_derives` reaches `sim_sound`
ONLY through its proof term, so a value-blind walk fails THAT line loudly instead of silently
green-lighting all four rejectors. -/

## Stage 3 (`der_finite`) — NOW CLOSED (this note records how `sim_sound` fits the closed proof).

`sim_sound` here is the SEMANTIC foundation of "finite up to `≅`": it proves the quotient relation
respects the matched language, so a finite set of `≅`-classes is a finite set of recognized
languages (non-vacuous). The COMBINATORIAL finiteness COUNT — once named here as the remaining wall —
is now BUILT AND PROVEN kernel-clean across the `Deriv.{Combinatorics,TTerm,Permute,
SymbolicDerivative,Pieces,Finite,Monotone,Finiteness}` modules:

  * `Deriv.Finiteness.der_finite` : `∃ xs, ∀ {n}, steps r n ⊆[≅] xs` — the whole symbolic-derivative
    state space fits, up to `≅`, in the fixed finite `⊕(pieces r)` (depends only on
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`).
  * the closure heart `Deriv.Finite.step_to_pieces` and the lift `Deriv.Monotone.toSumSubsets_monotone`
    + the `pieces`-similarity layer (`Deriv.Finiteness.pieces_equiv'`/`pieces_trans'`) are the ported
    ITP'25 tower (`step_to_pieces` / `Permute` nodup block / `pieces_equiv'`), over dregg's `Pred`.

So `sim_sound` (this module) is the language-soundness that makes that finite ≅-quotient a finite set
of recognized LANGUAGES. Stage 3 is closed; nothing here is a wall.

This is the design §3.3 "hard core #1 — months, not days," and it is NOT reduced by owning the
carrier (only the licensing/toolchain costs were). It is faithfully buildable (the structure
transfers; the leaf changes), but it is a multi-file syntactic-combinatorics port, not a
before-lunch close. It is named here so the next session opens the `pieces`/`Permute` port directly,
with the semantic foundation (`sim_sound`) already banked.
