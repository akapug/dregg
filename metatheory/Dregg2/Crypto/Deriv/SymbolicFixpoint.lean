# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.SymbolicFixpoint — the ADAPTIVE `≅`-fixpoint: symbolic emptiness made
RUNNABLE, consuming `AciComplete.simDecide` (previously consumed by NOTHING).

## The problem this closes

`predRE_emptiness_decidable` / `predRE_emptiness_decidable_general` are PROVEN `n`-free decisions,
but they decide at depth `emptinessBound R = |⊕(pieces R)|` — a POWERSET bound that kernel
evaluation cannot reach except for `ε` (bound 4). `SymbolicDecision.lean` §4 had to leave the
`false` verdict on the empty machine as a HYPOTHESIS (`contradiction_empty_of_bound_false`), and
even the BOUND ITSELF is intractable to compute (`⊕` materializes the powerset list).

The audit-named fix (docs/DESIGN-symbolic-decidability-status.md): dedup the reachable derivative
frontier UP TO `≅`, and stop when it saturates. The `≅`-class count is finite
(`satStep_reachable_finite` / `reachableWithinG_subset_pieces`) and SMALL in practice (a handful of
states), so a worklist that adds a derivative only when it is NOT `simDecide`-similar to an
already-seen state closes in a few pops — where the bound-based search needed `3^15+` residuals.

## What is built

* **`reachFixAux`** — the worklist: pop `s`; if `simDecide u s` for some seen `u`, DISCARD (the
  `≅`-dedup, `AciComplete.simDecide` finally consumed); else move `s` to `seen` and push its
  `satStepG` successors. Fuel-indexed (structural termination), returning `none` on fuel
  exhaustion and `some seen` on SATURATION (empty worklist).
* **`reachFix` / `emptyFix`** — the fixpoint and the emptiness verdict off it (`some true` =
  proven empty, `some false` = proven nonempty, `none` = fuel ran out).
* **Correctness** (`reachFix_any_null_iff`, `emptyFix_some_iff`): on saturation, a nullable seen
  state ⟺ a real accepting word — of ANY length, over the INFINITE `Value` alphabet.
  SOUNDNESS: every seen state is a concrete `derList w R` (`reachFixAux_sound`), so a nullable one
  exhibits its word. COMPLETENESS: the saturated `seen` is `satStepG`-closed UP TO `≅`
  (`reachFixAux_closed`), so by the der-congruence `sim_der` every cover-word's residual is
  `≅`-represented in `seen`, and `sim_null` (nullability is `≅`-INVARIANT) guarantees the dedup
  never dropped an accepting state. This is exactly why `≅`-dedup preserves the answer.
* **`predRE_emptiness_decidable_fix`** — the RUNNABLE `n`-free decision on
  `SymbolicRE ∧ RigidFull`: fixpoint first; on fuel exhaustion it falls back to the proven
  bound-based `predRENonemptyDecidableG`, so the instance is TOTAL and correct at EVERY fuel.
* **The `#guard`s fire on non-`ε` machines** — the deliverable the bound-based tower could not
  produce: `rolePlus` (a `symEq`-based cat/star guard) kernel-decides NONEMPTY, and `roleContra`
  (the contradictory machine, `emptinessBound ≥ 15` ⇒ `3^15+` residuals for the bounded search)
  kernel-decides EMPTY at ALL lengths — through `decide`, in a handful of worklist pops.
  `roleContra_empty` lands the very verdict-shape `SymbolicDecision.lean` left hypothetical.

## The `RigidFull`-reachability bridge (the CHECK, answered)

`simDecide` decides `≅` only when its LEFT argument is `RigidFull` (every atomic leaf
`predBEq`-decidable). Two facts make the fixpoint sound:

1. **Reachable derivatives of a `RigidFull` root STAY `RigidFull`** (`rigidRE_der` /
   `rigidRE_derList`, proven below): `der` never invents a leaf — it propagates the existing ones
   and introduces only `bot = sym .ff`, which is rigid. So rigidity is checked ONCE, at the root.
2. **A `SymbolicRE` root is in fact always `RigidFull`** — the boundary this item once named is
   CLOSED: the 07-19 `predBEq` widenings descend `not`/`and`/`or` structurally AND decide the
   `symMemberOf`/`digFieldEq`/`allOf`/`anyOf` leaves (AciNormal), so every `IsSymbolic` leaf class
   is `predBEq`-decidable — `rigidRE_of_isSymbolic` (SymbolicMintermsPlus) discharges the
   `RigidFull` side condition for the WHOLE `IsSymbolic` fragment. `contradictionRE` and
   enum-membership guards sit INSIDE the runnable fragment (`#guard`ed below); what remains
   outside `rigidRE` are only the `fieldEqField`/reactive leaves, which are outside `IsSymbolic`
   too. The instances below still take the (now always-dischargeable) `RigidFull` hypothesis
   so this module is untouched by the widening — every theorem transports unchanged, as
   `AciComplete`'s residual already states for its own.

## Termination, scoped honestly

Termination of the WORKLIST is structural (fuel). The instance is total and correct at every fuel
(the fallback arm is the already-proven bound-based decision, never `Classical.dec`). What is NOT
proven here: that fuel `(emptinessBound R + 1) * (|V| + 1) + 1` always suffices — the pigeonhole
"pairwise-non-`≅` seen states embed into `⊕(pieces R)` up to `≅`, so `|seen| ≤ emptinessBound R`"
is the named missing counting step (its ingredients, `reachableWithinG_subset_pieces` +
`simDecide_correct`, are both in hand). Saturation at SMALL fuel on the concrete machines is
instead kernel-WITNESSED by the `#guard`s — which is the operational point: the adaptive fixpoint
stops when the `≅`-frontier closes, not at the astronomical bound.

`#assert_axioms`-clean, `sorry`-free.

/-! ## §1 The rigidity bridge — reachable derivatives of a rigid root stay rigid.

This is the CHECK the fixpoint needs: `simDecide`'s correctness requires `RigidFull` on the left,
and every left argument the worklist ever passes is a reachable derivative. `der` propagates the
existing leaves and introduces only `bot = sym .ff` (rigid), so the whole reachable state space of
a `RigidFull` root is `RigidFull` — rigidity is a ROOT-ONLY obligation. -/

/-! ## §7 The deliverable `#guard`s — the fixpoint KERNEL-DECIDES non-`ε` machines.

`rolePlus` ("one or more role frames") is a `symEq`-based cat/star guard: NOT nullable at the
root, so its nonemptiness needs a real derivative step — and its `emptinessBound` is astronomical.
`roleContra` is the contradictory machine (`SymbolicMinterms`' UNSAT-minterm canary):
`emptinessBound ≥ 15` put its `n`-free `false` verdict out of kernel reach for the bounded search
(`3^15+` residuals); the fixpoint closes it in 4 `≅`-classes. -/
