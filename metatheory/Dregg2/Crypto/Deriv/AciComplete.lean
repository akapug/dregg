# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.AciComplete — FRAGMENT COMPLETENESS of `normalize`, and the
# NON-COMMUTATIVITY of `alt` under `≅` as a machine-checked COROLLARY.

`AciNormal.lean` argues in PROSE that `Sim`'s three `alt` laws (`assoc`, `idem`, `dedup`) are the
identities of a **left regular band** (`x(yz)=(xy)z`, `xx=x`, `xyx=xy`) and hence that
`alt a b ≅ alt b a` is NOT derivable — the fact the whole "order-preserving first-occurrence dedup,
never sort" design rests on. That argument is a model-theoretic sketch about the FREE left regular
band; nothing in it was checked. This module replaces it with theorems.

## What is proved

1. **`sim_key`** — the *first-occurrence disjunct sequence* is a `Sim`-INVARIANT on the pure-`alt`
   fragment. Stated as: the partial canonical key `key : PredRE → Option (List PredRE)` is constant
   on `≅`-classes, for EVERY `R S : PredRE` (no side condition — outside the fragment `key` is
   `none` on both sides, which is how the star/cat blind spots are absorbed honestly).

2. **`sim_normalize_eq`** — FRAGMENT COMPLETENESS:
   `Sim R S → Frag R → normalize R = normalize S`, where `Frag R` says every leaf of `R`'s `alt`
   spine is a `reEq`-decidable non-`alt` leaf (`ε`, or `sym p` with `p` in `predBEq`'s fragment).
   `Frag S` is not assumed — it FOLLOWS (`sim_frag`).

3. **`normalize_alt_comm_ne` / `not_sim_alt_comm`** — the FALSIFIER: two concrete distinct leaves
   with `normalize (a ⋓ b) ≠ normalize (b ⋓ a)`, hence by (2) `¬ Sim (a ⋓ b) (b ⋓ a)`. `alt` is
   NOT commutative under `≅`, as a theorem. Any normalizer that SORTS disjuncts therefore has an
   obligation that is not merely unproved but UNPROVABLE.

## How the invariance goes through, generator by generator

The key is `ddf ∘ altList` gated by rigidity, and its one structural law is
`ddf_append : ddf (u ++ v) = mergeR (ddf u) (ddf v)` (`mergeR l m = l ++ m.filter (∉ l)`), which
makes `key` a HOMOMORPHISM into the order-preserving-union monoid (`key_alt`). Then:

* `assoc` — a NO-OP on `altList`: both sides flatten to the same list by `List.append_assoc`.
  (Handled at the list level, so no `mergeR`-associativity is ever needed.)
* `idem` — `mergeR l l = l`; `dedup` — `mergeR l (mergeR m l) = mergeR l m`. Both need only that
  each element `y` of `l` satisfies `reEq y y = true`, which is exactly what rigidity buys.
* `altCong` — free, by the homomorphism `key_alt`.
* `negCong`, `interCong`, `catCong` — both sides have a NON-`alt`, NON-rigid head, so `key` is
  `none` on both. This is where the missing `starCong` / right-`catCong` stop mattering: the
  fragment simply does not contain those leaves, and `key` says so rather than guessing.
* `rfl`/`sym`/`trans` — the closure, for free, because the invariant is an EQUALITY of keys.

## THE WIDENING (second half of this file)

`Sim` is now a FULL congruence: `Similarity.lean` carries `catCongR` and `starCong`, and
`sim_null`/`sim_der`/`sim_sound` cover them. The obstruction that capped the first half — "recursing
would be UNSOUND without `starCong` and a right `catCong`" — is therefore GONE, and the second half of
this file takes the widening:

4. **`nrm`** — a RECURSIVE normalizer (`nlist` flattens the spine with every leaf normalized
   recursively; `nrm = foldList ∘ ddf ∘ nlist`), with **`nrm_sim : Sim (nrm R) R`** on ALL of
   `PredRE`.

5. **`sim_nkey`** — the recursive key `nkey R = ddf (nlist R)` (rigidity-gated) is a `Sim`-invariant.
   Where `sim_key` discharged `negCong`/`interCong`/`catCong` by `none = none` (the blind spot), every
   structural congruence now TRANSPORTS ITS IH through a key equation
   (`nkey_star`/`nkey_cat`/`nkey_inter`/`nkey_neg`, into `Option.map`/`bind`).

6. **`sim_nrm_eq`** — WIDENED COMPLETENESS on **`RigidFull`**: every ATOMIC LEAF is `reEq`-decidable,
   the STRUCTURE IS ARBITRARY (`star`/`cat`/`inter`/`neg` nodes are IN). `rigidFull_of_frag` proves
   this strictly contains `Frag`; the `#guard`s exhibit `star (a ⋓ a) ≅ star a`, which is `RigidFull`
   and not `Frag`, being collapsed by `nrm` and NOT by `normalize`.

7. **`simDecide_correct`** — hence `simDecide R S := reEq (nrm R) (nrm S)` is a genuine computable
   DECISION PROCEDURE for `≅` whenever the left argument is `RigidFull`.

## Scope, stated exactly (no laundering)

This is still NOT full `PredRE` completeness. What remains is ONE axis, not two: leaves outside
`predBEq`'s decidable fragment — the `atom` leaf is INSIDE it (`Exec.StateConstraint` carries
`DecidableEq`, `Exec/Program.lean`), and the 07-19 widenings put the compound `not`/`and`/`or`,
the n-ary `allOf`/`anyOf`, and the typed `symMemberOf`/`digFieldEq` leaves inside it too, so the
still-uncovered leaves are only `fieldEqField` and the reactive constructors — on which `rigidRE`
is fail-closed by the same one-sided-`reEq` discipline as `AciNormal`. That boundary widens exactly
as far as `predBEq` does, and every theorem below transports unchanged. The STRUCTURAL axis — the one `AciNormal`'s
residual §2 named as blocked — is closed. The residual is restated precisely at the bottom of this
file.

`normalize` itself is UNCHANGED (other modules depend on its shape); `nrm` is a new function beside
it, and the pure-`alt` results (1)–(3) stand on `normalize` exactly as before.

`Similarity.lean` is NOT edited (its `#assert_not_depends_on` pins stand). `sorry`-free.

/-! # THE WIDENING — a RECURSIVE normalizer, complete on the FULL rigid fragment.

`Sim` is now a FULL congruence (`Similarity.lean` carries `catCongR` and `starCong`, and
`sim_null`/`sim_der`/`sim_sound` cover them). The obstruction named in `AciNormal`'s residual §2 —
"recursing is UNSOUND under the present `Sim`: there is no `starCong` and `catCong` covers the left
factor only" — is therefore GONE. This section takes the widening.

`normalize` itself is left exactly as it is (it is `AciNormal`'s, and other modules depend on its
shape). The recursive normalizer is a NEW function `nrm`, built from the SAME two pieces:

* `nlist R` — the `alt` spine of `R`, flattened, with every non-`alt` LEAF normalized RECURSIVELY
  (`star r ↦ star (nrm r)`, `cat a b ↦ cat (nrm a) (nrm b)`, …). `ddf` is deliberately NOT applied
  at `alt` nodes: applying it there would force `mergeR`-ASSOCIATIVITY into the `assoc` case, whereas
  leaving the spine raw makes `assoc` `List.append_assoc` again — the same trick that keeps the
  pure-`alt` argument short.
* `nrm R := foldList (ddf (nlist R))` — dedup once, at the top of each spine.

and the canonical key becomes `nkey R = ddf (nlist R)` (gated by rigidity), which is a homomorphism
for `alt` (`nkey_alt`, into `mergeR` — unchanged) AND is now DETERMINED-BY-THE-KEY at every other
constructor (`nkey_star`/`nkey_cat`/`nkey_inter`/`nkey_neg`, into `Option.map`/`bind`). That second
family is what the new congruences buy: `starCong`/`catCongR` become one-line rewrites instead of
`key = none` on both sides.

The fragment widens from `Frag` (pure-`alt` over rigid leaves) to **`RigidFull`**: EVERY ATOMIC LEAF
is `reEq`-decidable, the STRUCTURE IS ARBITRARY — `star`, `cat`, `inter`, `neg` nodes are now IN.

## THE RESIDUAL — what is still NOT proved, after the widening.

`AciNormal`'s residual named TWO obstructions. **§2 (structural) is now CLOSED**; §3 (leaf equality)
is now closed for the `atom` leaf (`DecidableEq StateConstraint`), for the compound
`not`/`and`/`or` constructors, AND (second 07-19 widening) for the n-ary `allOf`/`anyOf` and the
typed `symMemberOf`/`digFieldEq` leaves, and remains open ONLY for the `fieldEqField`/reactive
leaves `predBEq` does not yet descend.

**CLOSED — the structural axis.** `sim_nrm_eq : Sim R S → RigidFull R → nrm R = nrm S` is completeness
on a fragment whose STRUCTURE IS ARBITRARY: `star`, `cat`, `inter` and `neg` nodes are inside it, at
any depth, and the `altCong` blind spot §2 named (`alt (star (alt a a)) b ≅ alt (star a) b`, two
disjuncts similar-but-unequal) is decided correctly — `#guard`ed. What paid for it is `Similarity`'s
`catCongR`/`starCong`: with a full congruence the recursion is SOUND (`nrm_sim`, unconditional), and
with the recursion the key determines itself at every constructor (`nkey_star`/`nkey_cat`/…), so the
four congruence cases of `sim_nkey` transport instead of collapsing to `none = none`.

**NARROWED — the leaf axis, now covering only the compound/typed leaves.** `rigidRE` demands
`predBEq p p = true` at every atomic leaf. The **`atom` leaf is now DECIDED**: `Exec.StateConstraint`
carries a real `DecidableEq` (added to `Exec/Program.lean` — all payloads decidable, incl. the
`Label`/`ClearanceGraph` lattice carriers), so `predBEq` totalizes on `atom` and every `atom`-leaf
term is now inside `RigidFull` (`#guard`ed: `rigidRE (.alt gAtom gAtom) = true`, `ddf` collapses the
`atom` pair to length 1). The compound `not`/`and`/`or` constructors are DESCENDED structurally,
and the second 07-19 widening added the n-ary `allOf`/`anyOf` (elementwise, `predBEqList`) and the
typed `symMemberOf`/`digFieldEq` leaves — enum-membership and owner-match guards are inside
`RigidFull` now. What is STILL outside are the leaves `predBEq` does not descend — `fieldEqField`
and the reactive constructors — exhibited on `gOut` (`fieldEqField`) at the end of the guard block.
The FULL statement, no rigidity side condition:

    `∀ R S, Sim R S → nrm R = nrm S`   -- FULL `PredRE`, no rigidity side condition

is still FALSE as stated only because of THOSE remaining leaves: `predBEq` answers `false` on an equal
`fieldEqField` pair, so `ddf` under-dedups there (`#guard`: the `gOut` pair stays length 2)
while `Sim.idem` holds. It becomes provable — with every theorem in this file transporting UNCHANGED,
since the invariance argument uses only `reEq_sound` plus reflexivity on the fragment — as `predBEq` is
extended to those constructors (each mechanical, the payloads are decidable; the `atom` closure here is
the template). THE NOW-UNBLOCKED FOLLOW-UP: widen `predBEq` over `fieldEqField` and the reactive
leaves to close the fragment entirely, and prove the then-unconditional full-`PredRE` statement.

**NOT a residual, but stated so it is not misread.** `≅` here is `Sim`, the ACI congruence on `alt`
plus the structural congruences. It contains NO unit/annihilator/star laws — `cat ε R ≅ R`,
`star (star R) ≅ star R`, `alt R (neg R) ≅ …` are not `Sim`-derivable and `nrm` does not attempt them.
"Complete for `≅`" therefore means complete for `Sim`, which is exactly the relation the Brzozowski
finiteness quotient is taken by (`Similarity.sim_sound`, `Finiteness.der_finite`) — it is the relation
`SymbolicEmptiness`'s unbounded rung needs decided, and `simDecide` now decides it on `RigidFull`.

What IS closed, restated: the order-preserving first-occurrence normal form is a COMPLETE invariant of
`≅` on the pure-`alt` fragment (`sim_normalize_eq`) and, recursively, on the whole rigid fragment
(`sim_nrm_eq`); and the SORTED normal form is UNREACHABLE (`not_sim_alt_comm`) — not merely unproved.
The "months-scale `Permute`/`Pieces`" estimate was priced against the sorting picture; the theorems
above say that price bought nothing, because the commutativity it needs is false.
