# `Dregg2.Crypto.MlDsaRing` — the REAL ML-DSA-65 polynomial ring `R_q = ℤ_q[X]/(X²⁵⁶+1)`, as EXECUTABLE `def`s.

FIPS 204. `q = 8380417`, `n = 256`. This module builds the negacyclic ring arithmetic and the ML-DSA
number-theoretic transform as plain computable `def`s (the same `leanc`-extractable shape as
`Dregg2.Crypto.Keccak` — BRICK 1, already byte-exact): no `Prop`, no classical choice, only `Nat`/`Array`
arithmetic reduced mod `q` with canonical reps in `[0, q)`.

It is BRICK 2 of replacing the `A = id` scalar caricature in `Fips204Verify.lean` with the real ML-DSA-65
verify. Every ML-DSA object — `SampleInBall`, `ExpandA`, the `t`/`z`/`w` vectors, the `A·z` matrix product —
lives in this ring, and the fast path multiplies polynomials in the NTT domain. So the correctness of the
whole verify rests on THIS module's `ntt`/`intt` being an honest length-256 negacyclic transform: the fast
`intt (pointwiseMul (ntt a) (ntt b))` must equal the ground-truth `schoolbookMul a b` (the real
`(a·b) mod (X²⁵⁶+1)` product, with the `X²⁵⁶ = −1` sign on wraparound).

## THE ANTI-FAKE GATE (checked, not asserted)

Executable `native_decide` theorems over CONCRETE polynomials pin the transform:

* `ntt_intt_id` — `intt (ntt a) = a` (round-trip; the inverse is a true inverse).
* `ntt_computes_negacyclic_mul` — `intt (pointwiseMul (ntt a) (ntt b)) = schoolbookMul a b`, on a pair with
  genuine high-degree wraparound (so the `X²⁵⁶ = −1` sign is exercised). THE load-bearing gate: the fast
  transform equals the real negacyclic ring product.
* `zeta_primitive_512th_root` — `ζ²⁵⁶ ≡ −1 (mod q)` for `ζ = 1753` (the property that makes the negacyclic
  NTT well-defined at all).
* `mul_mod_q_sanity` — `(q−1)·(q−1) ≡ 1 (mod q)` (reduction sanity).

`native_decide` runs the COMPILED `def`s. If the ζ-power order (FIPS 204 Algorithm 41 uses `ζ^{brv(k)}`, the
8-bit-reversed exponent), the bit-reversal, or the `intt` scaling (`256⁻¹ mod q = 8347681`) were wrong, these
theorems would NOT close. No `sorry`, no user `axiom`, no toy substitute for the transform.

## RESIDUAL

The gate theorems use `native_decide`, whose trusted base is `Lean.ofReduceBool` + `Lean.trustCompiler` (the
compiled-evaluation residual — the SAME class `Keccak` and `Fips204Verify` already name for their extracted
cores).

`q = 8380417` admits a primitive 512th root of unity `ζ = 1753`. The forward NTT (Algorithm 41) is a
length-256 negacyclic Cooley–Tukey transform whose twiddle at step `k` is `ζ^{brv(k)}`, where `brv` reverses
the low 8 bits of `k`. The inverse (Algorithm 42) is the Gentleman–Sande dual with twiddle `−ζ^{brv(k)}`
followed by scaling every coefficient by `256⁻¹ mod q = 8347681`. -/
