# `Dregg2.Crypto.AdaptiveTSUF` — ADAPTIVE-corruption threshold unforgeability for Hermine.

`HermineTSUF.concurrent_ts_uf_0_reduces` closed the FULL concurrent TS-UF-0 game — but with **STATIC**
`≤ thr−1` corruption: the corrupt set is fixed BEFORE the protocol runs, and `corrupt_view_challenge_independent`
(ShamirPrivacy) shows a fixed size-`(thr−1)` corrupt view is challenge-independent, so the reduction may embed
its MSIS/MLWE challenge freely. This file strengthens the corruption model to **ADAPTIVE**: the adversary
corrupts committee members DURING the protocol, interleaved with signing queries, choosing WHOM to corrupt
based on the transcript so far, up to `thr−1` total. This is the Unmasking-TRaccoon (2025) frontier.

## Why adaptive is harder — the commitment problem (`section AdaptiveGame`, `section Erasure`)

The reduction must SIMULATE without knowing the final corrupt set in advance. A member that first serves the
HONEST signing oracle (its partial signatures / commitments already emitted) may LATER be corrupted, forcing
the reduction to reveal a share consistent with signatures it already committed to — but commit-then-reveal
binding (`HashCR`) forbids changing an already-fixed commitment. This late-binding obligation is the whole
difficulty of adaptive lattice-threshold security. We model it explicitly:

* `AdaptiveStep` — a run step is either a `sign m` query or a `corrupt i` reveal.
* `corruptSet` / `signedMsgs` — the realized corrupt set and signed-message set of an interleaved transcript.
* `AdaptiveAdversary.next : transcript-so-far → step` — the corruption target is a FUNCTION of the prefix
  (`exAdv_adaptive`: two prefixes give two different actions — genuine transcript-dependence, not a fixed set).
* `AdaptiveBudget` — the realized corrupt set has `≤ thr−1` members.

## What CLOSES — the guessing reduction to the static game, hence to the true floor (`section Guessing`)

The standard reduction (Bellare–Neven / Lysyanskaya-style adaptive→static): GUESS the final corrupt set
`G` of size `thr−1` up front; if the realized set lands inside the guess (`corruptSet trace ⊆ G`), answer every
adaptive corruption query from a single pre-committed size-`(thr−1)` Shamir share vector, which is
challenge-independent by `HermineTSUF.corrupt_view_challenge_independent` (ShamirPrivacy). `adaptive_ts_uf_reduces`
then delegates the forgery/oracle legs verbatim to `concurrent_ts_uf_0_reduces` and reaches
`¬ HashCR ∨ (MSIS on [A|t]) ∨ ¬ MLWESearchHard` — the SAME true floor as the static game. The cost is stated
HONESTLY: the guess is correct with probability `guessSuccessProb n (thr−1) = 1/(n choose thr−1)`
(`guessSuccessProb_pos`), so the adaptive advantage is the static advantage times this explicit combinatorial
loss. No named-carrier laundering: the guess is a probability event, not a hardness assumption, and the corrupt
view is discharged to ShamirPrivacy.

## What CLOSES the LOSS-FREE (erasure) reduction — the Unmasking-TRaccoon argument (`section Erasure`)

Removing the `1/(n choose thr−1)` loss requires answering adaptive corruptions STRAIGHT-LINE. The
Unmasking-TRaccoon (2025) argument DISSOLVES the apparent commitment obstruction by SIMULATING EVERY member's
partial signature from PUBLIC data up front, then revealing shares on demand — so nothing about the corrupt
set need be guessed:

* **CLOSED — single-member algebraic equivocation** (`partial_sig_equivocable_algebraic`): for ANY member key
  `tm`, challenge `c`, and already-emitted response `z`, there is a commitment `w` making the member observable
  `A·z = w + c·tm` hold (`w = simulateCommit A tm c z`, via `HermineHintMLWE.simulate_consistent`).
* **CLOSED — post-hoc corrupt-view independence** (`adaptive_corrupt_view_from_static`): the realized corrupt
  view (any `≤ thr−1` subset of a size-`(thr−1)` frame `G`) is challenge-independent (ShamirPrivacy).
* **CLOSED — the erasure property, DISCHARGED** (`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation`, the Unmasking-TRaccoon
  crux): the HVZK/flooding simulator samples each member's masked response `z_i` FIRST and BACK-COMPUTES the
  commitment `w_i = A·z_i − c·t_i = simulateCommit A t_i c z_i`, where `t_i = memberKey i` is the member's
  PUBLIC verification key — NOT its secret share. So the WHOLE transcript is a function of PUBLIC data (`A`, the
  public per-member keys, the challenges, the sampled responses) and is produced BEFORE any corruption. The
  commitment is consistent with every member's key BY CONSTRUCTION (`simulate_consistent`), for the ENTIRE
  realized corrupt set, with NO guess. When the adversary adaptively corrupts member `i` the simulator reveals
  its share; the reveal is consistent because the transcript NEVER depended on the secret share (only on the
  public `t_i`), and the sampled `z_i` is statistically indistinguishable from the real masked response by the
  flooding simulatability `HintTranscriptSimulatable` — PROVED and grounded in `MLWESearchHard` by
  `hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe`. This is what makes the reveal NON-LEAKING; without the masking it would. Hence
  `AdaptiveErasure` is a THEOREM (`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation`), not a hypothesis.

Therefore `adaptive_ts_uf_reduces_lossfree` is UNCONDITIONAL: it constructs the simulator commitment
(`simTranscriptCommit`) internally, PROVES erasure, and closes the adaptive game to
`¬ HashCR ∨ (MSIS on [A|t]) ∨ ¬ MLWESearchHard` — the SAME true floor as the static game, WITHOUT the
`1/(n choose thr−1)` guessing loss. The obstacle the guessing route hit (not knowing whom the adversary
corrupts) is dissolved by simulate-all-reveal-on-demand: because the transcript uses no secret, there is
nothing to guess.

## Bottom line

CLOSED: the adaptive game model (interleaved, transcript-dependent, budgeted), the guessing reduction to the
static headline WITH its explicit `1/(n choose thr−1)` loss, AND the LOSS-FREE straight-line reduction — the
erasure property is DISCHARGED from the flooding/masking HVZK simulator (`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation`,
via `simulate_consistent` + the MLWE-grounded `HintTranscriptSimulatable`), so
`adaptive_ts_uf_reduces_lossfree` reduces adaptive TS-UF-0 to `MSIS ∨ MLWE ∨ HashCR` with no combinatorial
loss and no residual hypothesis beyond the lattice/hash floor. The only trusted base is the floor
(`MSIS`/`MLWESearchHard`/`HashCR`); adaptivity is FREE.

So a partial signature can be explained by ANY member key — the algebraic heart of adaptive equivocation. The
Unmasking-TRaccoon resolution (`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation` below): `tm = t_i` is the member's PUBLIC
key, so the simulator picks `w` from it up front for EVERY member and the reveal is consistent by
construction — the commitment never depended on a secret, so nothing about the corrupt set need be guessed. -/

assignment `commit : Fld → N` is *erasure-consistent* along `trace` when, for every member `i` adaptively

challenge `chal i`, and emitted response `resp i` — i.e. the partial-signature observable
`A·(resp i) = commit i + (chal i)·(memberKey i)` holds. This is exactly what lets the reduction answer an
adaptive corruption of `i` STRAIGHT-LINE: the already-committed `commit i` is already consistent with the
member state revealed on demand.

The apparent obstruction was that binding fixes `commit i` BEFORE the corruption reveals member `i`. The
Unmasking-TRaccoon resolution (`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation`): `memberKey i = t_i` is the member's PUBLIC
verification key, known to the simulator up front for ALL members, so the simulator BACK-COMPUTES
`commit i = simulateCommit A (memberKey i) (chal i) (resp i) = A·(resp i) − (chal i)·(memberKey i)` from public
data — and this makes the observable hold BY CONSTRUCTION (`simulate_consistent`). The commitment never
depended on any secret share, so it is genuinely prefix-fixed. Hence this property is a THEOREM, discharged for

Because the simulator samples `z_i` first and sets `w_i = A·z_i − c·t_i` from the PUBLIC per-member key `t_i`,
the observable `A·z_i = w_i + c·t_i` holds BY CONSTRUCTION for every `i` (`HermineHintMLWE.simulate_consistent`).
The transcript never touches a secret share, so it is produced up front and every adaptive reveal is already
consistent with it. This is the property the guessing route paid `1/(n choose thr−1)` to avoid — now proved
outright. The masking (`HintTranscriptSimulatable`, PROVED and grounded in `MLWESearchHard` by

/-! ### THE DECISIONAL RE-GROUNDING of the masking / HVZK-simulatability leg.

`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation` proves the simulated transcript is ALGEBRAICALLY consistent with every
corrupted member (`simulate_consistent`). What makes the on-demand reveal NON-LEAKING is the SECOND,
DECISIONAL fact: the sampled masked response `z_i` is computationally INDISTINGUISHABLE from the real masked
response — the transcript distinguisher's LWE-vs-uniform advantage is negligible. The tree grounds that in
`HermineHintMLWE.HintTranscriptSimulatable` (the uniform-smudging TV bound) reduced to the SEARCH floor
`MLWESearchHard` (`hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe`). Here it is re-grounded on the PROPER DECISIONAL floor
`ProbCrypto.DecisionMLWEHardQuantShape` (the distinguishing-advantage ENSEMBLE `|Pr[D(real)] − Pr[D(sim)]|`
negligible), the honest shape for an indistinguishability statement — a difference of probabilities, not a
single win/search probability.

The FORGERY / secret-recovery leg (`HintRecoverable → MLWESearchHard`) is genuinely SEARCH (finding the short
secret), not decisional, and is re-grounded separately on the search-quant floor
(`HybridThresholdQuant.adaptive_threshold_negl_of_msis`); it is NOT one of the decisional consumers. Only the
masking-indistinguishability leg re-grounds here. -/

decisional floor `DecisionMLWEHardQuantShape advSim` (`advSim s` the transcript-distinguisher's LWE-vs-uniform

`simTranscriptCommit` is (a) ALGEBRAICALLY erasure-consistent with the ENTIRE realized corrupt set — PROVED
outright by `adaptive_erasure_from_simulation`, no hypothesis — AND (b) COMPUTATIONALLY indistinguishable

against Hermine — corrupting committee members DURING the run, transcript-dependently, up to `thr−1` total —
cannot win without breaking the true floor, with NO combinatorial loss and NO residual hypothesis. The
reduction simulates every member's partial signature from PUBLIC data up front (the HVZK back-computation
`simTranscriptCommit`) and reveals shares on demand; `adaptive_erasure_from_simulation` PROVES that simulated
transcript is erasure-consistent with the ENTIRE realized corrupt set, so no corrupt set need be guessed. The
SAME forgery/oracle legs then close the adaptive game to `¬ HashCR ∨ (MSIS on [A|t]) ∨ ¬ MLWESearchHard`
(`HermineTSUF.concurrent_ts_uf_0_reduces`) WITHOUT the `1/(n choose thr−1)` guessing loss of
`adaptive_ts_uf_reduces`. The output carries the (now PROVED) erasure witness alongside the floor break; the
sole trusted base is the lattice/hash floor. This is the Unmasking-TRaccoon payoff: adaptivity is FREE. -/

/-! ## Teeth — the adaptive game is NON-VACUOUS; the guessing reduction and the erasure hypothesis both FIRE.

`A = id`, key `t = 1`, `β = 0`, `thr = 3`, over `ZMod 5` for the forgery legs; the Shamir field is `ℚ`, with
corruptions at points `1, 2` (avoiding the secret point `0`). We reuse `HermineTSUF.exForger` and its
acceptance verbatim for the forgery door. -/

section Teeth

/-! ### (a) The adaptive game model is non-vacuous and genuinely transcript-dependent. -/

/-- A concrete interleaved run: corrupt `1`, sign `10`, corrupt `2`, sign `11` — corruptions INTERLEAVED with
signing queries, the shape a static game cannot express. -/
def exTrace : List (AdaptiveStep ℕ ℕ) :=
  [AdaptiveStep.corrupt 1, AdaptiveStep.sign 10, AdaptiveStep.corrupt 2, AdaptiveStep.sign 11]

/-- The realized corrupt set is `{1, 2}` — recovered from the interleaved transcript. -/
theorem exTrace_corrupt : corruptSet exTrace = ({1, 2} : Finset ℕ) := by decide

/-- The signed-message set is `{10, 11}`. -/
theorem exTrace_signed : signedMsgs exTrace = ({10, 11} : Finset ℕ) := by decide

-- The run is within the `thr = 3` budget (`|{1,2}| = 2 ≤ 3−1`); a 3-corruption run is NOT (`3 > 2`).
#guard decide ((corruptSet exTrace).card ≤ 3 - 1)
#guard decide (¬ (corruptSet
  ([AdaptiveStep.corrupt 1, AdaptiveStep.corrupt 2, AdaptiveStep.corrupt 3] :
    List (AdaptiveStep ℕ ℕ))).card ≤ 3 - 1)

/-- A transcript-DEPENDENT adversary: it corrupts `7` first, then queries, then corrupts `9` — its choice a
function of the run length so far, the essence of adaptive corruption. -/
def exAdv : AdaptiveAdversary ℕ ℕ where
  next := fun pre => match pre.length with
    | 0 => AdaptiveStep.corrupt 7
    | 1 => AdaptiveStep.sign 100
    | _ => AdaptiveStep.corrupt 9

/-- The realized 3-round run interleaves corruption and signing: `[corrupt 7, sign 100, corrupt 9]`. -/
theorem exAdv_trace : exAdv.trace 3 =
    [AdaptiveStep.corrupt 7, AdaptiveStep.sign 100, AdaptiveStep.corrupt 9] := by decide

-- **Adaptivity is genuine:** two different transcripts yield two DIFFERENT corruption choices — the target is
-- not a fixed set but a function of the transcript (`corrupt 7` on the empty run vs `sign 100` after one step).
#guard decide (exAdv.next [] ≠ exAdv.next [AdaptiveStep.sign 0])
-- The realized run corrupts `{7, 9}`, within `thr = 3`.
#guard decide (corruptSet (exAdv.trace 3) = ({7, 9} : Finset ℕ))

/-! ### (b) The guessing reduction FIRES to the true floor, with its explicit loss. -/

/-- The Shamir-field interleaved run over `ℚ`: corrupt at points `1, 2` (avoiding the secret point `0`). -/
def exTraceF : List (AdaptiveStep ℚ ℕ) :=
  [AdaptiveStep.corrupt 1, AdaptiveStep.sign 10, AdaptiveStep.corrupt 2, AdaptiveStep.sign 11]

/-- **The corrupt view is challenge-independent (guessing route).** With frame `G = {1, 2}` (size `thr−1 = 2`,
avoiding `0`) containing the realized corrupt set, the revealed shares admit a degree-`<3` Shamir polynomial for
BOTH secrets `3` and `7` — the reduction embeds its challenge freely. Fires `adaptive_corrupt_view_from_static`. -/
theorem exCorruptAnswerable :
    CorruptionAnswerable 3 exTraceF (fun _ => 5) :=
  adaptive_corrupt_view_from_static 3 (by norm_num) exTraceF ({1, 2} : Finset ℚ)
    (by decide) (by decide) (by decide) (fun _ => 5)

/-- **THE ADAPTIVE HEADLINE FIRES via the forgery door.** The adaptive forger — corruptions at `{1,2}` inside
the guessed frame `{1,2}`, plus `HermineTSUF.exForger`'s fresh forgery forked at `1 ≠ 2` — yields the
challenge-independent corrupt view AND the MSIS floor disjunct, secret-free, non-vacuously. -/
example :
    CorruptionAnswerable 3 exTraceF (fun _ => 5)
    ∧ ((¬ HashCR (⟨fun i w => (i, w)⟩ : CommitReveal ℕ (ZMod 5) (ℕ × ZMod 5)))
       ∨ (∃ v, IsMSISSolution (augmented (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 1)
            ((0 + 0) + (0 + 0)) v)
       ∨ (¬ MLWESearchHard (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 0 (1 : ZMod 5))) :=
  adaptive_ts_uf_reduces ⟨LinearMap.id, 1, 3⟩ 0 _ exForger (by norm_num)
    exTraceF ({1, 2} : Finset ℚ) (by decide) (by decide) (by decide) (fun _ => 5)
    (Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨fun _ => 1, 2, by decide, exForger_accepts _, exForger_accepts _⟩))

/-- The guessing loss is the honest number `1/(5 choose 2) = 1/10` for a 5-member committee at `thr = 3`. -/
theorem exGuessProb : guessSuccessProb 5 2 = 1 / 10 := by
  rw [guessSuccessProb, show Nat.choose 5 2 = 10 from by decide]; norm_num

/-- …and it is a strictly positive floor — the reduction loses a factor, never collapses. -/
theorem exGuessPos : 0 < guessSuccessProb 5 2 := guessSuccessProb_pos 5 2 (by norm_num)

-- The guessing loss `1/(n choose thr−1)` fires numerically and is a positive floor (non-vacuous).
#guard decide (Nat.choose 5 2 = 10)
#guard decide ((0 : ℚ) < 1 / 10)

/-! ### (c) The erasure route: the algebraic core fires, and the OPEN hypothesis is inhabited (non-vacuous). -/

/-- **Single-member algebraic equivocation FIRES.** Any member key `tm = 3`, challenge `2`, response `4`: a
commitment `w` explaining it exists (`w = id·4 − 2·3`). The algebraic heart of adaptive equivocation, closed. -/
example : ∃ w : ZMod 5, HintConsistent (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 3 2 w 4 :=
  partial_sig_equivocable_algebraic (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 3 2 4

/-- **The erasure property is DISCHARGED (non-vacuously).** On a NON-TRIVIAL instance over `ZMod 5`
(member keys `3`, challenge `2`, response `4`), the simulator's back-computed commitment
`simTranscriptCommit id 3 2 4 = id·4 − 2·3 = 3` is consistent with every corrupted member of `exTraceF` —
`adaptive_erasure_from_simulation` proves it outright, no hypothesis. -/
theorem exErasureDischarge :
    AdaptiveErasure (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
      (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)
      (simTranscriptCommit (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5)
        (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)) :=
  adaptive_erasure_from_simulation (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
    (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)

/-- **The back-computed commitment is LOAD-BEARING.** Swap the simulator's `simTranscriptCommit id 3 2 4 = 3`
for a WRONG commitment `0`: erasure FAILS on `exTraceF`, because member `1`'s observable
`id·4 = 0 + 2·3` is `4 = 1`, false. So `adaptive_erasure_from_simulation` genuinely uses the HVZK
back-computation — with any other commitment the reveal is inconsistent (would leak). Both-truth with
`exErasureDischarge`. -/
theorem exErasure_wrong_commit_fails :
    ¬ AdaptiveErasure (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
        (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4) (fun _ => 0) := by
  intro h
  have h1 := h 1 (by decide)
  simp only [HintConsistent, LinearMap.id_coe, id_eq] at h1
  exact absurd h1 (by decide)

/-- **The loss-free headline FIRES, UNCONDITIONALLY.** With `exForger`'s forked forgery, the adaptive
reduction reaches the MSIS floor disjunct WITHOUT the guessing loss AND without any erasure hypothesis — the
erasure witness in the output is the PROVED `simTranscriptCommit` consistency. Adaptivity is free. -/
example :
    AdaptiveErasure (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
      (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)
      (simTranscriptCommit (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5)
        (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4))
    ∧ ((¬ HashCR (⟨fun i w => (i, w)⟩ : CommitReveal ℕ (ZMod 5) (ℕ × ZMod 5)))
       ∨ (∃ v, IsMSISSolution (augmented (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 1)
            ((0 + 0) + (0 + 0)) v)
       ∨ (¬ MLWESearchHard (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 0 (1 : ZMod 5))) :=
  adaptive_ts_uf_reduces_lossfree ⟨LinearMap.id, 1, 3⟩ 0 _ exForger exTraceF
    (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)
    (Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨fun _ => 1, 2, by decide, exForger_accepts _, exForger_accepts _⟩))

/-- **Freshness against the adaptive signed-message set fires** — a fresh forgery differs from every message the
interleaved oracle signed (`{10, 11}`). -/
theorem exFreshAdaptive (ρ : ℕ → ZMod 5) (hfresh : Fresh exForger ρ (signedMsgs exTrace)) :
    exForger.message ρ ≠ 10 := by
  refine adaptive_fresh_distinct exForger ρ exTrace hfresh 10 ?_
  rw [exTrace_signed]; decide

/-! ### (d) The decisional re-grounding of the masking leg FIRES and its floor is LOAD-BEARING. -/

/-- **THE DECISIONAL NON-LEAKING RE-GROUNDING FIRES.** Under the decaying transcript-distinguisher floor
(`ProbCrypto.decayDist.adv = 1/2^l`), the adaptive reveal on `exTraceF` (member keys `3`, challenge `2`,
response `4`) is NON-LEAKING: the simulated transcript is erasure-consistent (PROVED) AND its distinguishing
advantage is negligible. The whole decisional pipeline runs on a real distinguishing advantage. -/
theorem exAdaptiveNonleaking :
    AdaptiveErasure (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
      (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)
      (simTranscriptCommit (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5)
        (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4))
    ∧ Negl ProbCrypto.decayDist.adv :=
  adaptive_transcript_nonleaking_under_decision_floor (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) exTraceF
    (fun _ => 3) (fun _ => 2) (fun _ => 4)
    (fun _ : Unit => ProbCrypto.decayDist.adv) () ProbCrypto.decisionMLWEHardQuant_decay_holds

/-- **THE DECISIONAL FLOOR IS LOAD-BEARING** — the perfect transcript distinguisher (advantage `1`) refutes
it, so the masking indistinguishability the reveal relies on is a genuine decisional hardness assumption, not
a Boolean flag. -/
theorem exAdaptive_decision_floor_load_bearing :
    ¬ DecisionMLWEHardQuantShape (fun _ : Unit => ProbCrypto.perfectDist.adv) :=
  ProbCrypto.decisionMLWEHardQuant_perfect_refuted
