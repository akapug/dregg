# Dregg2.Crypto.Bridge — §8 discharge: cross-chain observation-bridge comparison predicate.

Discharges `WitnessedKind.bridge`: an observed foreign value `v` both (a) opens against a committed
foreign-state digest `c` and (b) clears a disclosed `threshold` (`threshold ≤ v`). Mirrors
`bridge_action_air.rs`.

    bridge_bridge       : Satisfies bridgeCircuit (c, threshold, v) ↔ BridgeRelation compress (c,threshold,v)
    bridge_verify_sound : verify accepts → BridgeRelation …  (derived off the bridge + `extractable`)
    bridge_dial_wired   : dial at `selective` floor (commitment + threshold disclosed; `v` hidden)

The comparison half (`RecordCircuit.range_proves_le`) is fully proved with no primitive seam.
Cryptographic residue: the abstract `compress` opening equation (CR/binding is the Layer-A
`collisionHard`/`binding` carrier, never touched by the bridge) and the STARK `extractable` carrier.

/-! ## The Bridge relation (the statement algebra) — an observed value that OPENS + CLEARS a threshold.

The bridge observes a foreign value `v : Int`. The disclosed statement is the committed foreign-state
digest `c : Digest` and the expected `threshold : Int`. The relation: the prover knows an OPENING of
`c` to a digest `vDigest` of the observed value (with a blinding `salt`), AND the observed value clears
the threshold (`threshold ≤ v`). The digest-opening is over the ABSTRACT Layer-A `compress` (its
collision-resistance / binding is the carried `CryptoPrimitives.collisionHard`/`binding`, NEVER invoked
here — like Merkle); the comparison is the honest `RecordCircuit.range` gadget. `vDigest` is the
digest the observed value commits to (the foreign-state limb the AIR binds, `bridge_action_air.rs`); the
linkage `vDigest ↔ v` is part of the witness the prover supplies. -/

variable {Digest : Type u}

/-- **`Opens compress c vDigest salt`** — the digest-OPENING half of the bridge: the disclosed
commitment `c` is the `compress` of the observed value's digest `vDigest` with the blinding `salt`. This
mirrors the boundary `PiBinding` of `bridge_action_air.rs` (the committed foreign digest pinned to the
witnessed limbs). `compress` is ABSTRACT — this is a pure equation; its collision-resistance / binding
is the Layer-A `collisionHard`/`binding` carrier, consumed elsewhere (the verifier-kernel
extractability), NEVER by the bridge. NO primitive seam: like Merkle's node hash, the opening is just an
equation over the uninterpreted `compress`. -/
def Opens (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest) (c vDigest salt : Digest) : Prop :=
  c = compress vDigest salt

/-- **`BridgeRelation compress c threshold v vDigest salt`** — the full bridge statement: the observed
value `v` OPENS against the committed foreign digest `c` (`Opens`, via `vDigest` + `salt`) AND CLEARS
the disclosed `threshold` (`threshold ≤ v`, the comparison the §5 note names). The relation the
verifier's accepting bit must certify — a foreign observation that both matches the committed state and
satisfies the expected comparison. -/
def BridgeRelation (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest)

  Opens compress c vDigest salt ∧ threshold ≤ v

/-! ## `CircuitIR` — the bridge AIR: a one-sided range gadget (comparison) + the opening boundary.

Mirrors `bridge_action_air.rs`: the trace carries the observed value's digest limbs (pinned to the
committed `c` by the boundary `PiBinding` — the OPENING) and the comparison column. The comparison is
the §5 "range gadget": a `DIFF` column carrying `v - threshold` and its `DIFF_BITS` boolean
decomposition with the high-bit-zero non-negativity constraint (exactly `RecordCircuit.range_iff`,
one-sided — a `Gte` threshold). We carry the comparison's bit-witness directly (`cmpBits` decomposes
`v - threshold`, proving `threshold ≤ v`) plus the opening witness (`vDigest`, `salt`). The COMPARISON
has NO primitive seam (pure range combinatorics); the OPENING rides the abstract `compress` equation
(its CR is the Layer-A carrier). -/

/-- **The bridge circuit IR** — the trace: the comparison range-gadget bit-witness plus the opening
witness. `cmpBits` is the boolean decomposition of `v - threshold` (the `Gte` comparison gadget, the §5
range gadget); `vDigest`/`salt` are the foreign-value digest + blinding the opening boundary pins to the
committed `c` (`bridge_action_air.rs` limbs). -/

/-- **`Satisfies compress circuit c threshold v`** — the full bridge AIR check, over the disclosed
commitment `c` and threshold, and the witnessed observed value `v`: the comparison gadget's `DIFF_BITS`
is boolean (`Binary` per-bit gate) and recomposes the difference (`DIFF` recomposition gate)
— `bitsToInt cmpBits = v - threshold`, exactly `range_iff`, giving `threshold ≤ v` — AND the opening
boundary holds: `c = compress vDigest salt` (the foreign digest pinned to the committed state). This is
the conjunction the bridge AIR enforces. -/
def Satisfies (compress : Digest → Digest → Digest)

  -- comparison gadget: cmpBits is a boolean decomposition of v - threshold (⇒ 0 ≤ v - threshold ⇒ threshold ≤ v).

/-! ## The bridge — `Satisfies ↔ BridgeRelation`, BOTH directions.

The COMPARISON half rides the honest `range_iff` gadget (`Exec/RecordCircuit.lean`), which has NO
assumed soundness — `→` uses `range_proves_le`, `←` uses `range_complete`. The OPENING half is a pure
`compress` equation carried through both directions (no `compress` algebra is needed — the equation is
just threaded). There is NO primitive seam inside the gadget: the comparison is pure combinatorics, and
the opening is an uninterpreted equation whose CR/binding lives in the Layer-A `collisionHard`/`binding`
carriers (consumed by `bridge_verify_sound`, never here). -/

/-- **`bridge_sound` (the `→` half).** A satisfying trace PROVES the relation: the comparison gadget's
`range_proves_le` forces `threshold ≤ v`, and the opening boundary IS `Opens`. Fully proved, no crypto
(the opening equation is threaded, never opened). -/

`threshold ≤ v` build a boolean decomposition of `v - threshold` (`range_complete`), and carry the
opening witness (`vDigest`, `salt`) the relation supplies. The bit-width is the prover's chosen width
(the canonical `Int.toNat`-based one, whose `2^width` exceeds the difference). -/

/-- **`bridge_bridge`** — the bridge AIR's satisfiability is exactly `Opens c ∧ threshold ≤ v`.
Soundness: the comparison range gadget forces `threshold ≤ v` (`range_proves_le`), the opening
boundary IS `Opens`. Completeness: a genuine relation yields a satisfying trace via `range_complete`.
The comparison core is fully proved with no primitive seam; the opening is an abstract `compress`
equation threaded through, with CR/binding in the Layer-A carrier consumed by `bridge_verify_sound`. -/

exists for the disclosed `(c, threshold)` at some observed value `v`"; `bridge_verify_sound` is DERIVED

/-! ## Layer C — the kind obligation + the DIAL wiring at the `selective` floor.

The committed foreign-state digest `c` and the expected `threshold` are DISCLOSED (the verifier learns
WHICH foreign state + WHICH comparison the observation clears), but the exact observed value `v` is the
hidden witness — the proof testifies "the observed value opens against `c` and clears `threshold`"
without revealing `v` itself. So the epistemic floor is `selective` (chosen facts — the commitment +
threshold — plus the conclusion), NOT the `acceptanceOnly` ZK bottom (which would hide the commitment
too) and NOT `fullDisclosure` (which would reveal the observed value). This matches
`PHASE-CRYPTOKERNEL.md §5` ("the comparison AIR (range gadgets)") and parallels Pedersen / Temporal,
which also sit at `selective` (they disclose the commitments / window). We wire `EpistemicDial.DiscloseAt`
to the verifier exactly as the prior kinds do. -/
