# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomQueryDial` — the query budget is LOAD-BEARING, because dialling it up FLIPS the
verdict at the same game.

`RomQueryFloor.romCollision_hard` proves the random-oracle collision floor against `RomEff F Q` at a
polynomially bounded `Q`. A floor with a hypothesis raises the question its own statement cannot
answer: is `hQ : PolyBounded ..` doing work, or is `Hard (romCollisionGame F) (RomEff F Q)` true for
every `Q`? In the second case `RomEff` would be a smallness condition that the budget merely
decorates, and `RomQueryFloor`'s escape from `FloorGames.hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` would rest
on the tree shape alone.

## What this file settles

`romCollision_exhaustive_budget_false`: at `Q l = |D l|` — enough calls to read the oracle's whole
truth table — the floor is FALSE. The class `RomEff F Q` then contains `bruteComp`, which queries
every domain point, reconstructs `H` from the answers, and returns a collision. It wins on EVERY
oracle (pigeonhole, `RomQueryFloor.romCollision_always_solvable`), so its advantage is the constant
`1`, refuted by `ConcreteSecurity.not_negl_one`.

`binaryRom_budget_separates` states the consequence at the deployed family: at `Q l = l` the floor
holds (`RomQueryFloor.binaryRom_hard_linear_budget`), at `Q l = 2·2^l` it does not. Same game, same
win relation, same class SHAPE — only the budget differs, and the verdict flips. `Q` is a dial
between the two horns.

## ⚑ What the budget bounds is CALLS, not thought

`bruteComp` is `noncomputable` and uses `Classical.choice` twice over: `reconstruct` rebuilds the
oracle from the answer list, and `pickColl` selects a collision out of the reconstructed function by
`Exists.choose`. That is not a defect of the construction — it is the model's content. `RomOracle.
QueryBounded` bounds the number of oracle calls along a path and says nothing whatever about the
continuations `k : R → OracleComp ..`, which are arbitrary Lean functions. `bruteComp` is
`FloorGames.choiceAdv` in every respect except one: it PAYS for its knowledge of `H`, one query per
domain point. `RomQueryFloor.choiceAdv_not_romEff` excludes `choiceAdv` from the class at a
polynomial budget because it knows without asking; `bruteComp` asks, and at an exhaustive budget it
is admitted, and the floor falls. The exclusion is about queries and nothing else.

This is the residual `RomQueryFloor` names, seen from the other side: the budget is a query count,
not a running time, and `bruteComp` shows exactly how much an unbounded-thought adversary can buy
with `|D l|` calls — everything.

/-! ## §1 — RECONSTRUCTION: the answers to every domain point ARE the oracle. -/

/-- **THE ORACLE, REBUILT FROM AN ANSWER LIST.** `reconstruct ds rs d0` reads `x`'s answer off `rs`
at `x`'s position in `ds`, falling back to `d0` when `x` does not occur. It is the only thing a
query tree ever has: a list of points it asked about and a list of what came back. -/

/-- **READING EVERY POINT RECOVERS THE ORACLE.** When `ds` meets the whole domain, the answers to
`ds` determine `H` exactly. `List.idxOf` returns the FIRST occurrence and `ds[ds.idxOf x] = x` holds
for every `x ∈ ds`, so duplicates in `ds` do no harm and `ds.Nodup` is not needed. -/

/-! ## §2 — the brute-force attack: read the whole oracle, then choose a collision. -/

/-- **THE COLLISION, CHOSEN.** Given the oracle in hand, pick a collision of it wherever one exists.
`Exists.choose` — the same non-constructive selection `FloorGames.choiceAdv` performs. What §3 does
differently is PAY for the oracle: `pickColl` is applied only to a function reconstructed from
`|D l|` answers that were actually asked for. -/

/-- **THE CHOSEN PAIR IS A COLLISION, AT EVERY ORACLE OF A COMPRESSING FAMILY.** Pigeonhole supplies
the existence (`RomQueryFloor.romCollision_always_solvable`), so the `dif` takes its positive branch
and `Exists.choose_spec` is the win. -/

/-- **⚑ THE BRUTE-FORCE QUERY TREE.** It queries EVERY point of the domain in turn, rebuilds `H`
from the answers, and returns a collision of it.

⚑ It is `noncomputable`, and its continuation is `Classical.choice` — deliberately. `RomOracle.
QueryBounded` bounds oracle CALLS along a path; the continuations are arbitrary Lean functions and
this file's point is that they may be as non-constructive as they like. A query-bounded adversary is
restricted in what it ASKS, not in what it THINKS. This tree is `FloorGames.choiceAdv` in every
respect except that it pays for its knowledge of `H`, one query per domain point — and §4 shows the
price is affordable exactly when the budget reaches `|D l|`. -/

/-- **⚑ THE BUDGET IS LOAD-BEARING — at a budget large enough to read the whole oracle, the floor is
FALSE.**

`RomQueryFloor.romCollision_hard` carries `hQ : PolyBounded ..`, and this theorem is what makes that
hypothesis content rather than decoration: at `Q l = |D l|` the SAME floor at the SAME game is
refuted. `RomEff F Q` is therefore not a smallness condition that holds for every budget, and
`RomQueryFloor`'s escape from `FloorGames.hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is not a property of the
`OracleComp` shape alone. The witness is `bruteComp`: it makes `|D l|` calls, learns `H`, and wins
with probability `1`. -/
