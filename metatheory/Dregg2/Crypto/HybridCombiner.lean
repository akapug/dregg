# `Dregg2.Crypto.HybridCombiner` — the KEYSTONE of "hybrid, not PQ-only".

The whole no-pre-quantum campaign ASSERTS that dregg's signatures and KEMs are HYBRID: a classical
component (ed25519 / X25519, hard iff discrete log is) welded to a post-quantum component (ML-DSA /
ML-KEM, hard iff a lattice problem is), verified/combined so that breaking ONE leaves the other holding.
This file PROVES that formal content — the two combiner security theorems the campaign leans on but never
stated:

* **Signatures (Part A).** A hybrid signature that verifies BOTH component signatures over the same
  message is EUF-CMA-unforgeable if EITHER component is. The reduction is the beautiful part: a hybrid
  forgery on a FRESH message `m*` is a PAIR `(σc*, σpq*)` with BOTH halves valid on `m*`, so PROJECTING
  the pair gives a forgery on the classical scheme AND, independently, a forgery on the pq scheme. Hence a
  hybrid forger yields a component forger on each side; if either component's EUF-CMA holds, the hybrid
  forger cannot exist. This is the "ed25519 OR ML-DSA suffices" theorem.

* **KEMs (Part B, X-Wing).** The hybrid shared secret `ss = KDF(ss_x ‖ ss_pq ‖ transcript)` is
  IND-CCA-secure if EITHER X25519 OR ML-KEM is — provided `KDF` is a **dual-PRF** (the standard X-Wing
  requirement, stated explicitly and reduced to, never hidden): keyed on EITHER input it preserves the
  unpredictability of that input. Breaking one component leaves the other's shared secret as an
  unpredictable key the adversary cannot pin, so the combined output stays unpredictable.

## No named-carrier laundering

Neither combiner introduces a hardness carrier. Each component's game bottoms out at the EXISTING floors:
`classical_euf_cma_grounded_in_dl` reduces the classical half to `SchnorrCurveField.SchnorrDLHard` (the
curve DL assumption) through the Schnorr EUF-CMA→DL forking reduction (a REDUCTION hypothesis, cited to the
proved forking machinery of `HermineTSUF`, NOT a re-asserted carrier); `pq_euf_cma_grounded_in_msis`
reduces the pq half to `Lattice.MSISHard` by feeding a forked ML-DSA forgery to the PROVED SelfTargetMSIS
extraction `HermineSelfTargetMSIS.no_forgery_under_msis_selftarget`. The combined
`hybrid_secure_if_either_floor` then says: the hybrid signature is unforgeable if EITHER `SchnorrDLHard` OR
`MSISHard` holds — the formal "hybrid, not PQ-only".

## Modelling notes (honest boundaries)

* EUF-CMA is modelled at the level `VRF.lean`/`RandomnessBeacon.lean` use: the signing oracle is captured
  by the set `Q` of queried messages (the hybrid signer signs each queried message with BOTH keys, so both
  component oracles see EXACTLY `Q`), a `Forgery` is a self-contained witness `(m, σ)` with `m` fresh
  (`¬ Q m`) and valid, and `EufCma := ¬ Forgery`. Freshness on the hybrid IS freshness on each component
  (same `m ∉ Q`), so the projection reduction is perfectly faithful without probabilistic machinery.
* The dual-PRF's load-bearing consequence — unpredictability-preservation keyed on either input — is
  modelled as key-wise INJECTIVITY, the SAME concrete proxy `RandomnessBeacon.lean` uses for
  unpredictability (an injective combine-hash = an unpredictable output). The full probabilistic dual-PRF
  is the standard X-Wing assumption; this captures its structural content and does not hide it.

/-! ## PART A — the hybrid signature ∧-combiner. -/

/-- **An abstract signature scheme** over carrier types: secret keys `SK`, public keys `PK`, messages
`Msg`, signatures `Sig`. `pkOf` is the public half of keygen; `sign sk m` signs; `verify pk m σ` decides
(as a `Prop`) whether `σ` is a valid signature on `m` under `pk`. -/
structure SigScheme (SK PK Msg Sig : Type*) where
  /-- The public key of a secret key (public output of keygen). -/
  pkOf : SK → PK
  /-- Signing: `sign sk m` produces a signature on `m`. -/
  sign : SK → Msg → Sig
  /-- Verification of a signature against a public key and message. -/
  verify : PK → Msg → Sig → Prop

/-! ### Correctness. -/

/-- **Correctness hypothesis.** Every honestly-produced signature verifies against the derived public key —
the relation a concrete scheme establishes between `sign` and `verify`. -/
def Correct {SK PK Msg Sig : Type*} (S : SigScheme SK PK Msg Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ (sk : SK) (m : Msg), S.verify (S.pkOf sk) m (S.sign sk m)

/-- **CORRECTNESS.** Given the hypothesis, an honestly-signed message verifies. -/
theorem correctness {SK PK Msg Sig : Type*} (S : SigScheme SK PK Msg Sig) (hc : Correct S)
    (sk : SK) (m : Msg) : S.verify (S.pkOf sk) m (S.sign sk m) := hc sk m

/-! ### EUF-CMA (existential unforgeability under chosen-message attack).

The signing oracle is captured by `Q : Msg → Prop`, the set of messages the adversary queried. A `Forgery`
is a FRESH-message signature: `m` not in `Q` (`¬ Q m`) with a verifying `σ`. `EufCma := ¬ Forgery` — no
adversary produces a valid signature on a message it never had signed (the abstract-game style of
`VRF.lean`/`RandomnessBeacon.lean`). -/

/-- **A forgery** against `pk` given the queried-message set `Q`: a FRESH message `m` (`¬ Q m`) carrying a
verifying signature `σ`. This is the adversary's win in the EUF-CMA game. -/
def Forgery {SK PK Msg Sig : Type*} (S : SigScheme SK PK Msg Sig) (pk : PK) (Q : Msg → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∃ (m : Msg) (σ : Sig), ¬ Q m ∧ S.verify pk m σ

/-- **EUF-CMA.** No forgery exists: no adversary with the signing oracle `Q` produces a valid signature on a
message outside `Q`. The named security game for the scheme. -/
def EufCma {SK PK Msg Sig : Type*} (S : SigScheme SK PK Msg Sig) (pk : PK) (Q : Msg → Prop) : Prop :=
  ¬ Forgery S pk Q

/-! ### The hybrid scheme — verify BOTH over the same message. -/

/-- **The hybrid verification relation** — verify BOTH component signatures over the SAME message: the
signature is a pair `(σc, σpq)` and it is valid iff the classical half AND the pq half each verify. This is
the whole content of "hybrid": acceptance requires both. -/

/-! ### The projection reductions — the "either suffices" proof.

A hybrid forgery on a fresh `m*` is a PAIR both of whose halves verify on `m*`. Projecting the first
coordinate is a classical forgery on the SAME fresh `m*`; projecting the second is a pq forgery. So a
hybrid forger yields a classical forger AND a pq forger — the load-bearing step. -/

/-- **PROJECT TO CLASSICAL.** A hybrid forgery yields a forgery on the classical component: take the fresh
message and the FIRST signature coordinate; the hybrid's `verify` gave `Cl.verify` as its left conjunct,
and freshness is the same `¬ Q m`. -/

  obtain ⟨m, σ, hfresh, hv⟩ := h
  exact ⟨m, σ.1, hfresh, hv.1⟩

/-- **PROJECT TO PQ.** Symmetrically, a hybrid forgery yields a forgery on the pq component: the SECOND
signature coordinate, on the same fresh message, valid by the right conjunct of the hybrid `verify`. -/

  exact ⟨m, σ.2, hfresh, hv.2⟩

/-- **THE HYBRID SIGNATURE COMBINER — EUF-CMA if EITHER component is.** If the classical OR the pq
component is EUF-CMA-unforgeable, so is the hybrid. Proof: a hybrid forger projects to a forger on EACH
component (the two projection reductions); whichever component's `EufCma` holds refutes its projection,
hence no hybrid forger exists. This is the formal "ed25519 OR ML-DSA suffices" — break one, the other still
holds. -/

/-! ### Anchoring the component games to the EXISTING floors (no re-asserted carrier).

Each component's `EufCma` bottoms out at a floor already in the tree — the classical half at
`SchnorrDLHard` (the curve discrete-log assumption), the pq half at `MSISHard` (Module-SIS). The bridge in
each case is a REDUCTION hypothesis (a forger ⟹ a solver / an MSIS witness), which is a THEOREM proved by
the existing forking + extraction machinery, NOT a hardness carrier. -/

/-- **CLASSICAL HALF grounded in discrete log.** Given the Schnorr EUF-CMA→DL reduction — a hybrid/classical
forgery yields a `DLSolver` on the curve (the forking-lemma reduction; reuses the PROVED forking machinery
of `HermineTSUF`, cited, not re-asserted) — the discrete-log assumption `SchnorrDLHard` implies the
classical scheme is `EufCma`. The floor is `SchnorrDLHard`; `fork` is a reduction. -/

/-- **PQ HALF grounded in Module-SIS.** Given the ML-DSA forgery→MSIS forking reduction — a fresh forgery
yields two SelfTargetMSIS solutions on a SHARED commitment `w` with DISTINCT challenges `c ≠ c'` (the
rewind/forking step of `HermineTSUF`, cited) — Module-SIS hardness on the augmented map `[A | t]` implies
the pq scheme is `EufCma`. The discharge runs THROUGH the PROVED extraction
`HermineSelfTargetMSIS.no_forgery_under_msis_selftarget`, so the ONLY floor invoked is `MSISHard`; `fork`
is a reduction, not a carrier. -/

end PqAnchor

/-- **THE KEYSTONE — hybrid unforgeable if EITHER FLOOR holds.** With the two forking reductions in hand,
the hybrid `ed25519 × ML-DSA` signature is EUF-CMA-unforgeable if EITHER the discrete-log floor
`SchnorrDLHard` OR the Module-SIS floor `MSISHard` holds. This is "hybrid, not PQ-only" as a theorem: a
quantum adversary that breaks the discrete-log half still faces MSIS; a lattice cryptanalyst that breaks
ML-DSA still faces discrete log. Only if BOTH floors fall does the hybrid fall. -/

/-! ### Teeth — the "either" is load-bearing, and the combiner is non-vacuous.

Toy schemes over `Unit` keys and `Bool` messages/signatures isolate the combiner. `secureToy` verifies
NOTHING (its `EufCma` holds — no forgery possible); `brokenToy` verifies EVERYTHING (a forgery on any fresh
message). With the empty query set (every message fresh):

* `hybrid secureToy brokenToy` is UNFORGEABLE — because ONE component (`secureToy`) is EUF-CMA, even though
  the other is fully broken. (Non-vacuity: the combiner delivers security from a single good component.)
* `hybrid brokenToy brokenToy` is FORGEABLE — if BOTH components are broken, the hybrid is broken. So the
  "either" hypothesis is LOAD-BEARING, not vacuous: one secure component is exactly what is needed. -/

/-! ## PART B — the hybrid KEM (X-Wing) combiner. -/

/-- **An abstract KEM** over carrier types: public keys `PK`, secret keys `SK`, ciphertexts `CT`, shared
secrets `SS`. `encaps pk = (ct, ss)` encapsulates; `decaps sk ct` recovers the shared secret. -/

/-! ### Unpredictability and the dual-PRF (the X-Wing requirement, stated explicitly).

A shared secret is UNPREDICTABLE when, as a function of the honest party's hidden encapsulation coins, it
is INJECTIVE — a fixed a-priori prediction matches at most one coin value, so the adversary cannot pin it.
This is the concrete unpredictability proxy `RandomnessBeacon.lean` uses (an injective combine-hash = an
unpredictable output). `KDF` is a **dual-PRF** when it preserves this unpredictability keyed on EITHER
input: injective in its first key argument (with the second fixed) AND injective in its second. Stated
honestly and reduced to — this is exactly the X-Wing dual-PRF requirement, not hidden. -/

/-- **Unpredictable** — the secret, as a function of the hidden input, is injective: distinct hidden inputs
give distinct secrets, so no fixed prediction matches more than one. -/
def Unpredictable {In SS : Type*} (f : In → SS) : Prop := Function.Injective f

/-- **DUAL-PRF (the X-Wing KDF requirement).** `KDF` preserves unpredictability keyed on EITHER input:
injective in the first key (second key + context fixed) AND injective in the second key. The standard
X-Wing assumption on the combiner, stated explicitly; the "either" theorem reduces to it. -/

  (∀ (k1 : SS) (tr : Ctx), Function.Injective (fun k2 => KDF k1 k2 tr))

/-! ### IND-CCA lift (stated honestly).

At the shared-secret level, IND-CCA of a KEM is exactly: the encapsulated shared secret, as a function of
the honest hidden coins, is unpredictable given the transcript (the standard KEM equivalence — IND-CCA ⟺
the encapsulated key is pseudorandom given the ciphertext, with the decapsulation oracle). We model IND-CCA
as this `Unpredictable` predicate, so the combiner core lifts directly. The full probabilistic IND-CCA game
(decaps oracle, distinguisher advantage) is the standard X-Wing statement this captures at the key level. -/

corresponding channel. This is "hybrid KEM, not PQ-only" — one component's IND-CCA suffices, provided the
KDF is a dual-PRF. -/

/-! ### Teeth — the dual-PRF is load-bearing, and the combiner is non-vacuous.

Over `ℤ` with the empty context. `goodKDF k1 k2 = k1 − k2` is injective in EACH argument — a genuine
dual-PRF — and it propagates unpredictability from EITHER channel. `badKDF k1 k2 = k1` IGNORES the second
input: it is injective in the first (single-PRF) but NOT the second, so it is NOT a dual-PRF, and it FAILS
to propagate a secure pq component. This is the load-bearing point of X-Wing: a combiner keyed on only one
input inherits security from that ONE fixed component; the DUAL-PRF is exactly what buys "either". -/

/-- **THE LOAD-BEARING TOOTH.** `badKDF` does NOT propagate a secure PQ component: even though the pq source
`id` is unpredictable, the hybrid secret through `badKDF` is CONSTANT (`= ssx`), hence predictable. So
without the DUAL-PRF property, "either" FAILS — a single-keyed combiner inherits security only from the
one fixed component. The dual-PRF assumption in `hybrid_kem_ind_cca_if_either` is load-bearing. -/
