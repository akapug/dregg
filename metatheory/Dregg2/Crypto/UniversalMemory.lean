# Dregg2.Crypto.UniversalMemory — ONE Blum multiset for ALL of dregg's state (the deepest collapse).

THE THESIS under test (.docs-history-noclaude/EPOCH-DESIGN.md tables → .docs-history-noclaude/CONVERGENT-CIRCUIT.md collapse): every
state access — register read/write, heap get/set, capability membership check, nullifier
insert/freshness — is a tuple in ONE memory multiset over a unified DOMAIN-TAGGED address space,
and the four map roots (cap_root, nullifier_root, heap_root, index root) are DERIVED boundary
views over the final memory cells. 5 tables → main + chip + range + ONE memory (+ the boundary
derivation absorbed into map-ops). The question this module answers: is that SOUND?

THE VERDICT (proved below): YES, with the boundary conditions named.

  * INTERIOR — `universal_memory_sound`: the ONE Blum balance (`MemoryChecking.memcheck_sound`)
    over the unified `Domain × κ` address space implies consistency of EVERY per-domain
    projection, each as a STANDALONE κ-addressed memory (`domTrace`/`stripOp`). One LogUp
    argument soundly covers registers + heap + caps + nullifiers + index. Zero per-access hashing.
    The combinatorial workhorses are `consistentFrom_filter` (consistency restricts to any
    address class — other-domain ops can't touch this domain's cells) and `consistentFrom_strip`
    (the tag peels off a single-domain trace injectively).
  * THE FINAL COLUMN IS PINNED — `memcheck_pins_final`: under the balance + discipline, the
    prover's claimed final value at every declared address IS the genuine fold of the trace
    (`chains_pin_fold`, the value-twin of `consistentFrom_of_chains`). So the boundary view
    derived from the final column is trustworthy, not prover-chosen.
  * BOUNDARY — `boundary_root_derived` / `boundary_root_from_memcheck`: the sorted-Poseidon2
    root of a domain's final memory cells (`boundaryCells`, the present-`some` cells in sorted
    address order) EQUALS today's map root whenever the map and the final memory have the same
    lookup semantics — by `Heap.root_deterministic`/`ext_get`, NO crypto. The derived view
    AGREES with the existing roots: a refactor, not a semantic change.
  * THE NULLIFIER WIN — `nullifier_fresh_sound`: intra-proof freshness IS a memory property:
    a read returning `none` at `(nullifiers, x)`, under the balance + the insert-only discipline,
    PROVES `x` absent from the proof's initial nullifier view AND never inserted earlier in the
    trace (no intra-proof double spend). NO Merkle path intra-proof. The composition
    `nullifier_fresh_binds_root` rides `Heap.root_injective`: the published root pins absence in
    ANY heap claiming it — cross-proof persistence lives entirely at the boundary.

What does NOT ride the memory multiset: move's conservation. The multiset argument is
PER-ADDRESS (rectangular); `Calculus/BiorthTensor.lean` proved conservation is NOT expressible
by any rectangular/per-component family (`conservation_not_behaviour_rectangular`) — Σδ=0 needs
the CORRELATED pair, so it stays an in-row paired-write constraint on the move row.

Non-vacuity, both polarities, on concrete multi-domain `(Domain × ℤ, Option ℤ)` traces:
the honest five-domain trace balances and every projection is consistent; a cross-domain
tuple-steal UNBALANCES (the tag makes domains disjoint sub-multisets); the flat UNTAGGED space
ALIASES (a cap check reads a nullifier's value — the tag is semantically load-bearing); the
intra-proof double-spend read is refused.

Axiom hygiene: `#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} everywhere. Crypto
enters ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis (the cap-root floor), never as an axiom.
Lean/design only — no circuit Rust here.

/-! ## §1 — the unified address space: one memory, domain-tagged.

The five state structures become five DOMAINS of one address space. An address is
`(domain, key)`; the deployment realization is `addr = hash[domain_tag, collection_id, key]`
(injective under the same sponge-CR floor as everything else — the tag here is the abstract
content of that hashing). Domains are DISJOINT sub-multisets by construction: a tuple written in
one domain can never cancel a claim in another (`Entry` equality requires address equality). -/

/-- The state domains of the unified memory: the five COMMITTED collections of
`EPOCH-DESIGN.md`'s commitment layout (registers · heap · capabilities · nullifiers · receipt
index), plus the transient `working` scratch. A future state component is a NEW domain value,
never a new table.

`working` is the universal-memory realization of the Rust `UDomain::Working`
(`turn/src/umem.rs:118`): a service cell's / the interpreter's / a long-running effect's
TRANSIENT scratch. It rides the ONE memcheck trace exactly like every other domain — so it is
consistent for free (`universal_memory_sound` quantifies over it like any `d`) and its cells
get their OWN non-aliasing address class by the same tag isolation (`consistentFrom_filter`).
But, exactly like `registers`, it is DESIGNED to publish NO committed boundary: it is never
projected into the state commitment (`working_commitment_inert` below makes "never projected ⇒
inert" a theorem, not a Rust `debug_assert`). Its boundary IS derivable on demand
(`working_umem_root`, the §4 checkpoint, and the level-1 image of `recursive_open_sound`),
it simply never enters consensus state. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE KEYSTONE: one balance covers every domain.

`memcheck_sound` gives consistency of the WHOLE unified trace. The two lemmas below push that
to every projection: `consistentFrom_filter` (general — consistency restricts to any address
class, because ops outside the class never move the class's cells) and `consistentFrom_strip`
(on a single-domain trace the tag peels off). Together: ONE multiset-balance argument is a sound
memory argument for registers, heap, caps, nullifiers, and the index SIMULTANEOUSLY. -/

AND every domain projection's consistency. This is the soundness obligation of the width-9
`Ir2Air::UMemBoundaryCohort` AIR (the welded single-domain leg): it drops the comparator columns
because at most one row exists, and Nodup follows from the row being alone — not from any
in-circuit comparison. -/

/-! ## §4 — the BOUNDARY derivation: the map roots are views over the final memory cells.

A map domain stores `Option ν` values: `some v` = present cell, `none` = absent. The derived
boundary view of a domain is `boundaryCells`: the present cells of the declared addresses, in
sorted address order — exactly a sorted leaf list in `Substrate/Heap.lean`'s sense. The
derivation theorem: today's map root (`Heap.root` of the cap/nullifier/heap leaf list) EQUALS
the root of the derived view whenever the two have the same lookup semantics — by canonicity
(`ext_get` / `root_deterministic`), NO crypto. So materializing the roots only at the boundary
is a refactor of WHERE the commitment is computed, not of WHAT it commits to. -/

/-! ### §4b — the INIT boundary is BOUND to committed PRE-state (the PI-v3 ride-along anchor).

The FINAL boundary derivation (`boundary_root_from_memcheck`) shows the prover's *post*-state
boundary view commits to the same object the deployed map roots commit to. Its mirror image is
what makes the universal boundary's INIT column TRUSTWORTHY rather than free-witnessed: the
boundary's declared init image must EQUAL the committed PRE-state, not be prover-chosen.

`boundary_init_root_derived` is exactly `boundary_root_derived` instantiated at `fin' = init`
(the init image is the GIVEN, so no memcheck pinning is needed — it is even simpler than the
final side). Welded to the circuit by pinning the computed boundary-init root to a committed
pre-state map root supplied as a public input, this is the soundness theorem behind the
in-circuit init binding: under the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (`Heap.root_injective`),
a boundary whose init image differs from the committed pre-state produces a DIFFERENT
sorted-Poseidon2 leaf list, hence a different root, hence the pin REFUSES. The bound boundary
init root = the committed map root, by canonicity, NO crypto in the derivation itself
(the CR floor enters only at the injectivity tooth, exactly as on the final side). -/

/-- **`boundary_init_root_bound` — the binding is sound (the anti-forgery tooth).** Under the
named CR floor, a committed pre-state map `hcommitted` and the prover's declared init heap
`hdeclared` carry the SAME root iff they ARE the same map. So pinning the boundary-init root to
the committed root forces the declared init heap to be the committed pre-state — a tampered init
image CANNOT keep the published root. The init-side companion of `nullifier_fresh_binds_root`. -/

    hdeclared = hcommitted :=
  Heap.root_injective hash hCR hroot

/-! ### §4c — the WHOLE-IMAGE boundary equality (the no-extra-cells direction).

`boundary_init_root_bound` proves the binding REFUSES a tampered declared heap. §4b's per-cell
realization (the deployed cross-cell-read, `satisfied2U_init_root`) proves only the SUBSET view:
each TOUCHED address `(d, a)` with `a ∈ as` opens to its declared value under the committed root.
That is sound for "this peer field IS the committed value" but it does NOT, on its own, forbid a
committed heap that holds the declared cells AND EXTRA cells the boundary never declared.

This section closes the no-extra-cells direction at the Lean level, by the route the in-circuit
WHOLE-boundary root-fold realizes: recompute the sorted-Poseidon2 root of the ENTIRE declared
boundary image `boundaryCells init as` and PIN it to the committed pre-state root. That single
pin, via `root_injective`, forces the committed heap to BE the boundary view — so the committed
heap's lookup semantics is EXACTLY the declared image: present-and-declared cells carry their
declared value, and EVERY address off the declared list is ABSENT in the committed heap (no
extra cells, no hidden cell). The two directions stated separately:
  * `boundary_image_eq_of_root` — the committed heap equals the boundary view (the leaf-list
    equality `root_injective` yields, the structural anti-ghost);
  * `boundary_whole_image_sem` — its consequence in lookup terms: the committed heap agrees with
    the declared image at EVERY address, INCLUDING absence off the declared list.

NO new crypto: the CR floor enters once, exactly as in `boundary_init_root_bound`. This is the
SAME `Poseidon2SpongeCR` tooth, applied to the whole-image fold instead of a per-cell opening.
The deferred work is entirely the in-circuit AIR that COMPUTES `Heap.root hash (boundaryCells
…)` over the universal boundary table and pins it to the committed-root public input; that fold
rides the universal-map rotation (it needs the rotation's per-domain sorted-leaf fold chip). The
Lean obligation it must discharge is precisely the hypothesis `hpin` below. -/

/-- **`boundary_image_eq_of_root` — the committed heap IS the boundary view (no extra cells).**
If the committed pre-state heap `hcommitted` carries the SAME root as the sorted-Poseidon2 fold
of the ENTIRE declared boundary image `boundaryCells init as`, then under the named CR floor the
committed heap EQUALS that boundary view as a leaf list. This is the structural no-extra-cells
fact: the committed heap can hold NOTHING the boundary did not declare, because a single extra
or altered leaf moves the root. The whole-image companion of `boundary_init_root_bound`, against
the recomputed fold rather than a separately-declared heap. -/

    hcommitted = boundaryCells init as :=
  Heap.root_injective hash hCR hpin

/-- **`boundary_whole_image_sem` — the committed heap agrees with the declared image EVERYWHERE.**
The lookup-world consequence of `boundary_image_eq_of_root`: under the CR floor, pinning the
committed pre-state root to the whole-boundary fold forces the committed heap's `get` to equal
the declared image at EVERY address — declared cells open to their declared value, and every
address OFF the declared list is absent. This is the full whole-image equality `hsem` that the
per-cell subset realization (`satisfied2U_init_root`'s hypothesis) had to ASSUME: here it is
DERIVED from the single whole-boundary root pin, with the no-extra-cells direction included.
(`as` sorted is needed for the boundary view to be the canonical sorted leaf list it folds as.) -/

/-! ### §4d — the WORKING domain is INERT in the commitment (never-projected ⇒ a theorem).

The Rust `UDomain::Working` (`turn/src/umem.rs:118`) is transient scratch: it rides the ONE
memcheck trace (consistent for free) but is NEVER emitted by `project_cell`/`project_ledger`/
`project_executor_state`, so its boundary root never enters the state commitment. That guarantee
was load-bearing only by the Rust FACT that the projection happens to never construct a
`UKey::Working` — a `debug_assert_no_working` comment (`turn/src/umem.rs:347`), not a checked
property.

`working_commitment_inert` makes it a THEOREM, by the same tag-disjointness that powers the whole
module: the committed boundary view of ANY committed domain `d ≠ working` reads `fin` ONLY at the
addresses `(d, a)` — addresses whose tag is `d`, never `working`. So two final memories that
agree everywhere OFF the working domain (the only place a working write can differ) derive the
IDENTICAL committed boundary view. A working address therefore cannot move any committed
boundary: it is inert in the state commitment, exactly as `registers` is. -/

/-- **`working_commitment_inert` — A WORKING ADDRESS NEVER ENTERS A COMMITTED BOUNDARY.** For any
committed domain `d` (`d ≠ working`), two final memories that AGREE everywhere off the working
domain produce the SAME committed boundary view. Working writes — the only cells where the two
can differ — leave every committed domain's boundary untouched, because that boundary reads `fin`
only at tag-`d` addresses (never tag-`working`). The "never projected ⇒ inert" Rust invariant,
made a theorem by tag-disjointness (the dual of `consistentFrom_filter`'s class isolation). -/

The sorted-Poseidon2 root of a committed domain's boundary is INVARIANT under any change confined
to the working domain (the value-world consequence of `working_commitment_inert`, by `congrArg`).
A working umem cannot perturb a single committed map root — it costs nothing on the consensus
path, regardless of how much working scratch a service writes. -/

/-! ### §4e — COMPOSABLE umems: the recursive open is TWO binds at DISJOINT levels.

A `UVal::UmemRef` (`turn/src/umem.rs:316`) makes one umem hold, at a key, the committed root of
ANOTHER umem. Reading "through" the ref is `open_through_umem_ref` (`turn/src/umem.rs:716`): bind
the OUTER service umem's committed boundary (the `working` domain) as an init image, read the
child root it names there, then bind THAT root as the INNER cell heap's (the `heap` domain) init
image and open the requested key. Two independent `boundary_init_root_bound` applications — the
keystone composed with itself.

The two levels CANNOT alias: the outer cells live in the `working` domain and the inner cells in
the `heap` domain, disjoint by tag. `recursive_levels_disjoint` makes that disjointness a theorem
(the two domain projections of ONE consistent trace are INDEPENDENT standalone memories,
`universal_memory_sound` at `working` and at `heap`); `recursive_open_sound` is the two-level bind
itself. A tamper at either level derives a different sorted-Poseidon2 root and the matching pin
refuses — soundness compositional for free. -/

/-- **`recursive_levels_disjoint` — the outer (working) and inner (heap) levels are independent.**
From ONE Blum balance, the outer service umem (`working` domain) and the inner cell heap (`heap`
domain) project to INDEPENDENT consistent standalone memories: a working op never moves a heap
cell and vice versa (tag isolation, two instances of `universal_memory_sound`). So the two
`boundary_init_root_bound` applications in `recursive_open_sound` bind genuinely independent
images — no cross-level aliasing. -/

  * LEVEL 1 — the outer service umem's declared image carries the committed boundary root
    (`houter`) ⟹ under the CR floor the declared OUTER image IS the committed working umem
    (`outerDeclared = outerCommitted`).
  * the bound outer umem NAMES `childRoot` at the ref address (`hnames`, the `UmemRef` cell), and
    that named root IS the genuine inner umem's committed root (`hchildRoot`).
  * LEVEL 2 — the declared inner heap is pinned to the named child root (`hchild`) ⟹ under the
    SAME CR floor the declared INNER image IS the committed child heap
    (`childDeclared = childCommitted`).
Two independent `boundary_init_root_bound` teeth; the levels are tag-disjoint
(`recursive_levels_disjoint`), so they cannot forge each other. The conclusion also re-exposes the
named child root through the (now-forced) outer DECLARED image — what the reader actually holds. -/

/-! ## §5 — THE NULLIFIER WIN: freshness is a memory property (no Merkle path intra-proof).

A nullifier domain cell is `none` (never spent) or `some _` (spent). Inserts are the only writes
(`InsertOnlyAt` — nobody un-spends). Then a read returning `none` at `(nullifiers, x)` — one row
of the memory table, certified by the same single balance as everything else — PROVES both:
`x` was absent from the proof's INITIAL nullifier view (= the incoming boundary set), and no
earlier op in this proof inserted it (no intra-proof double spend). Cross-proof persistence is
the boundary's: the initial view is loaded from the committed map, whose root pins absence in
any heap claiming it (`root_injective`). -/

/-! ### Negative polarity 2 — the FLAT (untagged) space ALIASES: the tag is load-bearing.

Tagged: inserting nullifier 7 leaves cap 7 untouched — the honest cap-absence read passes.
Flat: the same two touches collide at address 7 — the cap check READS THE NULLIFIER'S VALUE
(a ghost capability), and the honest absence read is REFUSED. -/

-- Tagged: cap 7 still absent after nullifier 7 is inserted (domains separate).
#guard decide (Consistent uinit
  ([⟨.write, (Domain.nullifiers, 7), some 1, none, 0⟩,
    ⟨.read, (Domain.caps, 7), none, none, 0⟩] : List (Op (UAddr ℤ) (Option ℤ))))
-- Flat: the cap read at 7 RETURNS the nullifier's value — the ghost is CONSISTENT (disaster)…
#guard decide (Consistent (fun _ => (none : Option ℤ))
  ([⟨.write, 7, some 1, none, 0⟩, ⟨.read, 7, some 1, some 1, 1⟩] : List (Op ℤ (Option ℤ))))
-- …and the honest "cap 7 absent" read is REFUSED in the flat space.
#guard decide (¬ Consistent (fun _ => (none : Option ℤ))
  ([⟨.write, 7, some 1, none, 0⟩, ⟨.read, 7, none, none, 0⟩] : List (Op ℤ (Option ℤ))))

/-! ### Negative polarity 3 — the intra-proof DOUBLE SPEND is refused.

Insert nullifier 7, then claim it's still fresh: the lying read's claimed tuple cancels nothing
(the insert's tuple is `some 1`), so no final claim can balance the multisets. -/

private def trDouble : List (Op (UAddr ℤ) (Option ℤ)) :=
  [⟨.write, N7, some 1, none, 0⟩,    -- the insert (serial 1)
   ⟨.read, N7, none, none, 0⟩]       -- "still fresh" (serial 2) — the double-spend lie

#guard decide (¬ MemCheck uinit (fun _ => (some 1, 1)) [N7] trDouble) -- …either claim refused

/-! ### Boundary non-vacuity — the derived view and its root, concretely.

The heap domain's final cells derived from the memory's (pinned) final column = the directly
built map; same sorted leaf list, same sponge root. And `boundary_root_derived` fires on it. -/

-- The derived boundary view of the heap domain is exactly the one-cell map…
#guard boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.heap, a)).1) [10] == [(10, 99)]
-- …with the same sorted-sponge root as the directly-built map (the refSponge instance).
#guard Heap.root Heap.refSponge (boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.heap, a)).1) [10])
  == Heap.root Heap.refSponge [((10 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))]
-- The lookup characterization, executably: declared-and-present / declared-and-absent / off-list.
#guard Heap.get (boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.heap, a)).1) [10]) 10 == some 99
#guard Heap.get (boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.caps, a)).1) [5]) 5 == none
#guard Heap.get (boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.heap, a)).1) [10]) 11 == none

/-- `boundary_root_derived` fires on the concrete instance: today's map `[(10, 99)]` has the
same root as the boundary view derived from the memory's final column. -/
example :
    Heap.root Heap.refSponge [((10 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))]
      = Heap.root Heap.refSponge
          (boundaryCells (fun a => (ufin (Domain.heap, a)).1) [10]) := by
  refine boundary_root_derived Heap.refSponge ?_ ?_ ?_
  · simp [Heap.SortedKeys, Heap.keys]
  · simp
  · intro a
    by_cases ha : a = (10 : ℤ)
    · subst ha; decide
    · rw [if_neg (fun h => ha (List.mem_singleton.mp h)),
        Heap.get_cons_ne _ _ ha, Heap.get_nil]

/-- The INIT-side anchor fires too: the committed pre-state map `[(10, 7)]` (the heap-domain
init image) has the same root as the boundary view derived from `uinit`. Both polarities of the
boundary derivation (init AND final) are concrete-witnessed. -/
private def uinit_one : UAddr ℤ → Option ℤ := fun a => if a = (Domain.heap, 10) then some 7 else none

example :
    Heap.root Heap.refSponge [((10 : ℤ), (7 : ℤ))]
      = Heap.root Heap.refSponge
          (boundaryCells (fun a => uinit_one (Domain.heap, a)) [10]) := by
  refine boundary_init_root_derived Heap.refSponge ?_ ?_ ?_
  · simp [Heap.SortedKeys, Heap.keys]
  · simp
  · intro a
    by_cases ha : a = (10 : ℤ)

        Heap.get_cons_ne _ _ ha, Heap.get_nil]

/-! ### Whole-image (no-extra-cells) non-vacuity — the extra cell MOVES the fold root.

`boundary_image_eq_of_root` / `boundary_whole_image_sem` carry the no-extra-cells punch under the
abstract CR floor; these guards exhibit it on the computable `refSponge`, the executable shadow.
A committed heap that holds the declared boundary cell `[(10, 7)]` AND an EXTRA cell `(20, 5)`
the boundary never declared has a DIFFERENT root from the whole-boundary fold `boundaryCells uinit
[10]` — so the whole-image root pin REFUSES it (a hidden cell cannot survive the fold), exactly
the direction the per-cell subset opening could not see. -/

-- The whole-boundary fold of the one-cell init image is the one-cell leaf list (positive):
#guard boundaryCells (fun a => uinit_one (Domain.heap, a)) [10] == [((10 : ℤ), (7 : ℤ))]
-- A committed heap with an EXTRA undeclared cell (20,5) has a DIFFERENT fold root — REFUSED:
#guard (Heap.root Heap.refSponge [((10 : ℤ), (7 : ℤ)), ((20 : ℤ), (5 : ℤ))]
  != Heap.root Heap.refSponge (boundaryCells (fun a => uinit_one (Domain.heap, a)) [10]))
-- The honest committed heap (exactly the boundary cell) MATCHES the fold root — admitted:
#guard (Heap.root Heap.refSponge [((10 : ℤ), (7 : ℤ))]
  == Heap.root Heap.refSponge (boundaryCells (fun a => uinit_one (Domain.heap, a)) [10]))
-- The whole-image lookup characterization: OFF-list address 20 is ABSENT in the boundary view
-- (the no-extra-cells direction in lookup terms — `boundary_whole_image_sem`'s `else none`):
#guard Heap.get (boundaryCells (fun a => uinit_one (Domain.heap, a)) [10]) (20 : ℤ) == none

/-- `boundary_whole_image_sem` fires structurally on a concrete committed heap = its boundary
view: the heap agrees with the declared image at the declared address AND is absent off-list.
(Stated against an abstract CR `hash`/`hCR` since the theorem rides the named floor; the pin
hypothesis is given by `rfl` on the matching heap, exercising the whole-image route end to end.) -/
example (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash)
    (init : ℤ → Option ℤ) (as : List ℤ) (has : as.Pairwise (· < ·)) :
    ∀ a, Heap.get (boundaryCells init as) a = if a ∈ as then init a else none :=
  boundary_whole_image_sem hash hCR has rfl

/-! ### Working-inert non-vacuity — a working write moves the working boundary but NOT a
committed one, and the committed root is unchanged. -/

-- Two final memories differing ONLY at a working cell `(working, 0)`: agree off the working
-- domain. (The hypothesis `working_commitment_inert` takes, exhibited concretely.)
private def finA : UAddr ℤ → Option ℤ := fun a => if a = (Domain.heap, 10) then some 99 else none
private def finB : UAddr ℤ → Option ℤ := fun a =>
  if a = (Domain.heap, 10) then some 99
  else if a = (Domain.working, 0) then some 7 else none

-- The committed HEAP boundary is IDENTICAL across the two (the working write is inert)…
#guard boundaryCells (fun a => finA (Domain.heap, a)) [10]
  == boundaryCells (fun a => finB (Domain.heap, a)) [10]
-- …but the WORKING boundary genuinely DIFFERS (finB wrote a working cell finA did not) —
-- the inert guarantee is about COMMITTED domains, and working really is a live (uncommitted) plane.
#guard boundaryCells (fun a => finA (Domain.working, a)) [0]
  != boundaryCells (fun a => finB (Domain.working, a)) [0]

/-- `working_commitment_inert` fires: `finA`/`finB` agree off the working domain, so the heap
domain's committed boundary view coincides — the working cell never enters it. -/
example :
    boundaryCells (fun a => finA (Domain.heap, a)) [10]
      = boundaryCells (fun a => finB (Domain.heap, a)) [10] :=
  working_commitment_inert (d := Domain.heap) (by decide)
    (fun a ha => by
      -- off the working domain finA and finB agree (they differ only at (working, 0))
      simp only [finA, finB]
      by_cases h0 : a = (Domain.working, 0)
      · exact absurd (h0 ▸ rfl) ha
      · rw [if_neg h0])

/-! ### Recursive-open non-vacuity — the two-level bind fires on a concrete UmemRef shape.

The inner umem `[(0, 99)]` has root `R`; the outer umem holds `R` at ref key `5` (a `UmemRef`).
Both binds discharge by `rfl` on the matching declared/committed heaps. Stated against the
abstract CR floor (as every boundary binder is): the recursive open is the keystone, twice. -/

example (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash) :
    ([((5 : ℤ), Heap.root hash [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))])] : FeltHeap)
        = [((5 : ℤ), Heap.root hash [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))])]
      ∧ ([((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))] : FeltHeap) = [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))]
      ∧ Heap.get ([((5 : ℤ), Heap.root hash [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))])] : FeltHeap) 5
          = some (Heap.root hash [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))]) :=
  recursive_open_sound hash hCR (refKey := 5)
    (outerCommitted := [((5 : ℤ), Heap.root hash [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))])])
    (childCommitted := [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))]) (childDeclared := [((0 : ℤ), (99 : ℤ))])
    rfl (by simp) rfl rfl
