# `Dregg2.Crypto.HermineHintMLWE` — a concurrent-security ARGUMENT for our 2-round commit-reveal Hermine.

## HONEST BOUNDARY (Tanuki cross-check, 2026-07) — READ FIRST

A follow-up analysis against the proven 2-round lattice threshold family (Tanuki [EKT24/Ringtail],
Threshold Raccoon [dPKPR24 Eurocrypt'24], "Unmasking TRaccoon" '25) found that **this is NOT a cited
instance of a proven scheme — it is a plausible design with an UNCLOSED concurrent-security reduction.**
Three corrections to the earlier overclaims:
* **Different family.** Our crypto-hermine impl (BN06 commit-then-reveal `cmᵢ=H(i,wᵢ)`, single-column
  `wᵢ=A·yᵢ`, exact key `t=A·s`, one flooding mask) is NOT Tanuki/TRaccoon (in-the-clear WIDE commitment
  `Wᵢ=A·Rᵢ+Eᵢ`, hashed `b`-aggregation as the actual rushing defense, pairwise zero-sum PRF masks, ROUNDED
  MLWE key). "Aligned to real Raccoon" was aspirational, not accurate.
* **NOT fully straight-line.** The masking-hiding leg IS rewinding-free, but the forgery→MSIS leg
  (`SelfTargetMSIS.selftarget_extract_nonzero`) REQUIRES two accepting transcripts on a common `w` with
  `c ≠ c'` — that is forking-shaped, and the two-transcript hypothesis is ASSUMED here, never PRODUCED from
  a single forger.
* **The full concurrent game is NOT reduced.** `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces` COMPOSES three
  individually-valid pillars around named carriers; it does NOT model the signing oracle or the t−1
  static corruption that a TS-UF-0 proof requires.
No exploit is evident and each pillar below is sound; but closing the gap means EITHER re-implementing
toward Tanuki/Ringtail's algebraic `b`-aggregation (a different construction) OR completing a TRaccoon-style
game-based proof for the commit-then-reveal variant (formalize the rewinding that yields the two
transcripts + signing-oracle simulation + corruption). Until then, treat the "concurrent unforgeability"
here as ARGUED, not PROVED. (crypto-hermine is a pre-audit reference; this is not a deployed hole.)

## STATUS AFTER THE HINT-MLWE → MLWE REDUCTION (2026-07-08) — READ SECOND

Pillar 1 no longer rests on an *assumed* Hint-MLWE carrier. `hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe` PROVES the
Hint-MLWE key-recovery assumption (`HintMLWEHard`, stated in the SAME non-existence currency as
`Lattice.MLWESearchHard`) REDUCES to `MLWESearchHard`. The KLSS23 hints `(wᵢ = A·yᵢ, zᵢ = yᵢ + cᵢ·s)` are
simulatable from the public `(A, t, cᵢ, wᵢ)` ALONE — the observable `A·zᵢ = wᵢ + cᵢ·t` is secret-free
(`hint_sample_consistent` / `simulate_consistent`) — up to the flooding statistical distance `Q·(B/M)`
(`concrete_transcript_union_loss`, Rényi-tightened to `≈√Q` via `RenyiHiding`/`GaussianRenyi`). So a secret
recovered from the transcript is an MLWE witness for `t` (`hint_recovery_yields_mlwe_witness`). The ONLY
irreducible object left in the masking story is `MLWESearchHard` (the true lattice floor); NO fresh
`…Hard` carrier is introduced. `HintTranscriptSimulatable` (the old distributional `HintMLWEHard`,
renamed) is the PROVED statistical core the reduction rides on, grounded in `Smudging.smudge_bound`.

STILL GENUINELY OPEN (NOT closed here — do not read the above as closing it): the full concurrent TS-UF-0
game — the signing oracle, the t−1 static corruption, and PRODUCING the two SelfTargetMSIS transcripts via
forking (they remain ASSUMED as hypotheses of `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces`, never extracted from a
single forger). This reduction closes the masking pillar's carrier only. Also DEFERRED (honest TODO, a
standard probability lemma — NOT a hardness carrier): the general-`Q` product-hybrid TV subadditivity
`statDist_pi_le_sum : statDist (⊗Pᵢ) (⊗Qᵢ) ≤ Σᵢ statDist Pᵢ Qᵢ`, which would upgrade the proven
union-bound loss `Σᵢ TVᵢ ≤ Q·(B/M)` to the JOINT-transcript TV. Until it lands, the `Q·(B/M)` figure is
the union/hybrid bound (a valid upper bound on the joint TV, standard), not the joint TV itself.

## What the three pillars ARE (each individually valid; the composition is what's incomplete)

1. **MASKING (Hint-MLWE).** Each signer's response `zᵢ = yᵢ + c·(λᵢ·sᵢ)` is a fresh one-time mask `yᵢ`
   plus a secret-dependent shift. Across MANY concurrent sessions the adversary sees many
   `(wᵢ = A·yᵢ, zᵢ)` "hints" on the secret; Hint-MLWE says the secret STAYS HIDDEN given these hints —
   the masked responses are SIMULATABLE without the secret. This is the multi-session generalization of
   the SINGLE-session key-hiding already proved in `Smudging`/`HermineHiding`/`RenyiHiding`/`GaussianRenyi`;
   we ground it there (`hint_mlwe_of_smudge` reduces one session to `signature_hides_secret`/`smudge_bound`),
   so the simulatability (`HintTranscriptSimulatable`) is PROVED, and the Hint-MLWE key-recovery hardness
   (`HintMLWEHard`) is REDUCED to `MLWESearchHard` by `hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe` — NO assumed carrier
   remains. Leakage is additive in TV
   (`hint_mlwe_hybrid_leakage`); the Rényi form (`RenyiHiding.renyiDiv2_mul`, `GaussianRenyi.gaussian_renyi2_pair`)
   tightens the `Q`-session cost from `Q·ε` to `≈ √Q`.
2. **COMMIT-THEN-REVEAL (binding).** Each signer commits `cmᵢ = H(i, wᵢ)` BEFORE revealing `wᵢ`, so a
   rushing adversary cannot adaptively choose its `wⱼ` after seeing the honest commitments — it is BOUND by
   `cmⱼ`. Under collision-resistance (`HashCR`) a signer cannot open one commitment to two different `wᵢ`
   (`commitment_binding`); an equivocating opening BREAKS `HashCR` (`equivocation_breaks_hashcr`). This is
   the rushing defense's teeth: it is what forces the two forgery transcripts to share ONE commitment `w`.
3. **SelfTargetMSIS.** A forgery bound to its commitment still yields an MSIS solution via the committed
   `Dregg2.Crypto.HermineSelfTargetMSIS.no_forgery_under_msis_selftarget` — `c ≠ c'` alone gives the
   nonzero short solution on the augmented map `[A | t]`, no invertibility, no MLWE-lossiness.

**THE HEADLINE** `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces`: a concurrent (rushing) forger who opens a common
commitment and outputs two accepting SelfTargetMSIS solutions with `c ≠ c'` cannot exist under
`HashCR ∧ MSISHard` — binding forces the shared commitment `w`, SelfTargetMSIS closes it. The dichotomy
`concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis` shows the rushing forger breaks HashCR (equivocation) OR
MSIS (bound forgery); `leakage_exceeds_budget_breaks_hint_mlwe` is the masking-pillar break (it learned
the secret from the hints). The proof COMPOSES the three pillars — no forking lemma, no ROS bound.

This composes a TRaccoon-FAMILY concurrency ARGUMENT (masking + commit-reveal + SelfTargetMSIS) — see the
HONEST BOUNDARY at the top of this file: it is NOT a cited instance of a proven scheme, and the FULL
concurrent game is NOT closed. What IS now on the true floor: pillar 1's masking carrier is REDUCED to
`MLWESearchHard` (`hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe`), no assumed Hint-MLWE carrier. What remains open: the
two-transcript hypothesis of `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces` is ASSUMED (forking-shaped, not produced from
a single forger), and the signing-oracle + t−1-corruption TS-UF-0 game is unmodeled. The "no forking lemma"
phrasing above describes only that the *composition* has no forking step — the forking is hidden in the
assumed hypothesis, which is exactly the gap to close. (It does correctly supersede the FROST-binding-factor
/ ROS framing, a group-setting mis-model.)

/-! ## Pillar 1 — MASKING: the simulatability core, and the Hint-MLWE → MLWE reduction.

A concurrent transcript is a family of "hint sessions": each session `i` shifts the WIDE mask support `S`
by a secret-dependent shift `shift i` (the `c·(λᵢ·sᵢ)` translate), so the real masked responses are
`unif (S.image (shift i))` while a secret-free SIMULATOR outputs `unif S`. `HintTranscriptSimulatable`
says every session's real transcript stays within statistical distance `ε` of the simulator — the PROVED
statistical CORE of the reduction. We PROVE it is exactly the multi-session lift of the smudging
key-hiding bound; the lattice-currency Hint-MLWE key-recovery hardness `HintMLWEHard` and its reduction to
`MLWESearchHard` follow in `section HintMLWEReduction`. -/

section HintMLWE

variable {α : Type*} [DecidableEq α] {ι : Type*}

/-- **`HintTranscriptSimulatable`** — the PROVED simulatability core (formerly the distributional
`HintMLWEHard`). Over `sessions` concurrent signing sessions, each a secret-dependent shift `shift i` of
the wide mask support `S`, the real masked-response transcript `unif (S.image (shift i))` is within
statistical distance `ε` of the secret-free simulator `unif S`. So the many hints leak at most `ε` per
session about the secret — the transcript is simulatable without it. Stated in the SAME `statDist`/`unif`
currency as the single-session key-hiding it generalizes, and PROVED from it (`hint_mlwe_of_smudge`), not
assumed. This is the statistical leg the Hint-MLWE → MLWE reduction (`hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe`) rides. -/

  ∀ i ∈ sessions, statDist (S ∪ S.image (shift i)) (unif S) (unif (S.image (shift i))) ≤ ε

/-- **Simulatability reduces to single-session key-hiding (the grounding).** If each session's shift is
injective (a genuine translate of the mask support) and moves at most `B` of the `M = |S|`-wide support,
then `HintTranscriptSimulatable` holds at `ε = B / M` — BY `HermineHiding.signature_hides_secret` (itself
`Smudging.smudge_bound`) applied per session. So the multi-session masking is the honest generalization of
the already-proved single-session masking, not an unrelated assumption. -/

/-- **Additive (TV) hybrid bound over `Q` concurrent sessions.** If each session is within `ε` of the
simulator, the total per-session leakage over the session set is at most `Q·ε` (`Q = |sessions|`) — the
straightforward union/hybrid bound. This is the loose TV form; the Rényi divergence
(`RenyiHiding.renyiDiv2_mul` multiplicativity, `GaussianRenyi.gaussian_renyi2_pair`) replaces the linear
`Q·ε` with the near-constant `≈ √Q` cost that Raccoon's parameters actually use. -/

  Finset.sum_le_card_nsmul sessions _ ε h

/-- **The masking-pillar break.** If some concurrent session leaks MORE than the budget `ε` (the adversary
learned the secret from the hints), then `HintTranscriptSimulatable` fails at `ε` — the simulator can no
longer track the real transcript, the pillar-1 break. The contrapositive of the definition, isolating "it
learned the secret from the hints" as a genuine break. -/

end HintMLWE

/-! ## Pillar 1 (reduction) — the Hint-MLWE key-recovery assumption REDUCES to MLWE (KLSS23).

The simulatability above is the CORE; here is the reduction that discharges the carrier. A KLSS23 hint
sample for secret `s` is `(wᵢ = A·yᵢ, zᵢ = yᵢ + cᵢ·s)` with `yᵢ` flooded/Gaussian. The observable
`A·zᵢ = wᵢ + cᵢ·(A·s) = wᵢ + cᵢ·t` is DETERMINED by the public `(t, cᵢ, wᵢ)` — the transcript leaks nothing
about `s` beyond `t = A·s`. So a simulator holding only `(A, t, c, w)` reproduces the transcript up to the
flooding distance `Q·(B/M)` (`HintTranscriptSimulatable` summed by `hint_mlwe_hybrid_leakage`, tightened to
`≈√Q` by `RenyiHiding.renyiDiv2_mul` / `GaussianRenyi.gaussian_renyi2_pair`), and recovering the short `s`
from that secret-free simulated transcript is exactly an MLWE key-recovery for `t`. Hence Hint-MLWE key
recovery reduces to `MLWESearchHard` — the ONLY irreducible object left, no fresh carrier. -/

the public `(t, c)` — the sample carries no information about `s` beyond `t`. -/

witness `(s, e = 0)`: `nrm s ≤ β`, `nrm 0 ≤ β`, `t = A·s + 0`. The hint transcript adds nothing — by
`hint_sample_consistent`/`simulate_consistent` it is a public-data function of `(t, c, w)` — so the

from `(A, t, c, w)` alone up to the flooding distance `Q·(B/M)` (`hint_mlwe_hybrid_leakage` on

transcript recovers it from a secret-free simulator that depends only on `t`; that recovered `s` is an MLWE

/-! ## Pillar 2 — COMMIT-THEN-REVEAL: binding is the rushing defense.

A signer commits `cmᵢ = H(i, wᵢ)` before revealing `wᵢ`. Collision-resistance of `H` (the named carrier
`HashCR`) is exactly what stops a rushing adversary from equivocating: it cannot open one commitment to
two different `wᵢ`. Binding is what FORCES the two forgery transcripts to carry the SAME commitment `w`,
which is precisely what SelfTargetMSIS (pillar 3) consumes. -/

section CommitReveal

/-- A commit-reveal instantiation: a hash `H` on `(index, commitment)` pairs. `commit i w = H(i, w)` and
`opens cm i w` says `w` is a valid opening of `cm` at index `i`. The committed value `w` is the Raccoon
lattice commitment `wᵢ = A·yᵢ`. -/

  cr.commit i w = cm

/-- **`HashCR`** — the named collision-resistance carrier: `H` is injective on the committed domain (for
each fixed index, distinct `w` hash to distinct commitments). Modeled as the abstract injectivity a
collision-resistant hash provides on the committed domain; assumed at the boundary, never proved (the
Poseidon2/hash floor `Dregg2` already carries). -/

/-- **COMMITMENT BINDING (the rushing teeth).** Under `HashCR`, a signer cannot open one commitment `cm`
to two different reveals: if `w` and `w'` both open `cm` at index `i`, then `w = w'`. So a rushing
adversary is BOUND to the `wⱼ` it committed — it cannot adaptively swap its commitment after seeing the
honest ones. This is the property that pins the two forgery transcripts to a SINGLE commitment `w`. -/

/-- **An equivocating opening BREAKS `HashCR`.** Two DISTINCT reveals `w ≠ w'` of the SAME commitment `cm`
witness a collision — so `HashCR` cannot hold. The contrapositive of `commitment_binding`: equivocation is

/-! ## The straight-line composition — the three pillars, no forking.

The rushing forger opens a common commitment (`cm`, index `i`) and outputs two accepting SelfTargetMSIS
solutions with `c ≠ c'`. Binding (pillar 2) forces the two reveals to the SAME lattice commitment `w`;
that shared `w` is what SelfTargetMSIS (pillar 3) needs; and the honest hints are simulatable (pillar 1),
so the reduction runs secret-free. There is NO forking lemma and NO ROS bound anywhere. -/

* **equivocated** (`w ≠ w'`) — an opening collision, so it BREAKS `HashCR` (pillar 2); or

  `selftarget_extract_nonzero` extracts a genuine NONZERO short MSIS solution on `[A | t]` from `c ≠ c'`
  (pillar 3), breaking `MSISHard`.

This IS the straight-line rushing defense: commit-then-reveal leaves the adversary exactly these two doors,
and both are closed by a named lattice/hash carrier. No forking, no ROS. -/

the same lattice commitment `w`; the shared `w` with `c ≠ c'` hands SelfTargetMSIS a nonzero short MSIS

(a) Binding: an injective `H` opens a matching reveal and CATCHES a mismatched one; a colliding `H`
    equivocates and breaks `HashCR`.
(b) Composition: a "forgery" with distinct challenges yields the SelfTargetMSIS solution while the masked
    hints are simulatable (`HintMLWEHard`) — the two-pillar composition running end-to-end. -/

/-! ### (a) Binding teeth. -/

/-- A binding commit-reveal: `H(i, w) = (i, w)` is injective on the committed domain. -/
def exCR : CommitReveal ℕ ℤ (ℕ × ℤ) := ⟨fun i w => (i, w)⟩

/-- The binding instance genuinely satisfies `HashCR`. -/
theorem exCR_hashcr : HashCR exCR := fun _ _ _ h => (Prod.ext_iff.mp h).2

-- A matching reveal OPENS the commitment.
example : exCR.opens (3, 7) 3 7 := rfl
-- A mismatched reveal is CAUGHT (does not open) — the binding tooth.
example : ¬ exCR.opens (3, 7) 3 8 := by
  intro h; simp [CommitReveal.opens, CommitReveal.commit, exCR] at h
#guard exCR.commit 3 7 = (3, 7)
#guard exCR.commit 3 8 ≠ (3, 7)

/-- A COLLIDING commit-reveal: `H(i, w) = 0` for all `w` — every reveal opens every commitment. -/
def badCR : CommitReveal ℕ ℤ ℕ := ⟨fun _ _ => 0⟩

/-- **Equivocation FIRES.** On `badCR`, the distinct reveals `7 ≠ 8` both open the same commitment `0`, so
`equivocation_breaks_hashcr` produces a genuine `¬ HashCR badCR` — the pillar-2 break, non-vacuously. -/
theorem badCR_not_binding : ¬ HashCR badCR :=
  equivocation_breaks_hashcr badCR 0 5 7 8 (by decide) rfl rfl

/-! ### (b) Composition teeth — `A = id`, key `t = 1`, commitment `w = 0`, over `ZMod 5`. -/

/-- A binding commit-reveal over the lattice commitment type `ZMod 5`. -/
def exCR5 : CommitReveal ℕ (ZMod 5) (ℕ × ZMod 5) := ⟨fun i w => (i, w)⟩

theorem exCR5_hashcr : HashCR exCR5 := fun _ _ _ h => (Prod.ext_iff.mp h).2

/-- Signer's forgery #1: response `z = 1`, challenge `c = 1`, commitment `w = 0` — accepts against `t = 1`. -/
theorem forge1 : IsSelfTargetMSISSolution (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 1 0 1 1 0 :=
  ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide, by simp [verify]⟩

/-- Signer's forgery #2: response `z' = 2`, challenge `c' = 2`, SAME commitment `w = 0`. `c ≠ c'`. -/
theorem forge2 : IsSelfTargetMSISSolution (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 1 0 2 2 0 :=
  ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide, by simp [verify]⟩

/-- **THE COMPOSITION FIRES.** Two forgeries sharing the commitment `w = 0` with `c ≠ c'`, opened under the
BINDING `exCR5`: the rushing dichotomy CANNOT take the equivocation door (`exCR5` is binding), so it hands
back a genuine `IsMSISSolution` on `[A | t]` — the straight-line composition running end-to-end. -/
example : ∃ v, IsMSISSolution (augmented (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 1)
    ((0 + 0) + (0 + 0)) v := by
  rcases concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis exCR5 (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5)
      1 0 (0, 0) 0 0 0 rfl rfl 1 2 1 2 (by decide) forge1 forge2 with h | h
  · exact absurd exCR5_hashcr h
  · exact h

-- The extracted MSIS solution's challenge coordinate is NONZERO (`−(1 − 2) = 1 ≠ 0` in `ZMod 5`) — the
-- `c ≠ c'` payoff is a real solution, not the trivial vector.
#guard decide (-((1 : ZMod 5) - 2) ≠ 0)
-- Collapse check: with `c = c'` the challenge coordinate would be `0` (non-triviality lost).
#guard decide (-((1 : ZMod 5) - 1) = 0)

/-- **The masked hints are SIMULATABLE (pillar 1), concretely.** One session shifts a width-10 uniform mask
by `+1`; `HintTranscriptSimulatable` holds at leakage `≤ 1/10`, grounded in
`signature_hides_secret`/`smudge_bound`. So the concurrent transcript hides the secret while the
composition above extracts the MSIS solution. -/
theorem concrete_hints_simulatable :
    HintTranscriptSimulatable (Finset.Ico (0 : ℤ) 10) ({0} : Finset ℕ) (fun _ => (· + 1))
      ((1 : ℚ) / 10) := by
  intro _ _
  have hinj : Function.Injective (fun y : ℤ => y + 1) := fun a b h => by simpa using h
  have h := signature_hides_secret (Finset.Ico (0 : ℤ) 10) (· + 1) hinj (by decide) 1 (by decide)
  simpa using h

/-! ### (c) The reduction's explicit `Q·(B/M)` statistical loss, and Hint-MLWE → MLWE, on concrete data. -/

/-- **Explicit reduction loss — the `Q·(B/M)` statistical term, concretely.** Two sessions, each shifting a
width-10 uniform mask by `+1`: the union-bound (hybrid) transcript distance from the secret-free simulator
is `≤ ({0,1}).card • (1/10) = Q·(B/M)` at `Q = 2, B = 1, M = 10`. (The true JOINT TV is `≤` this union
bound by the standard product-hybrid argument; formalizing general-`Q` product-hybrid subadditivity
`statDist_pi_le_sum` is the single deferred probability lemma — see header, NOT a hardness carrier.) -/
theorem concrete_transcript_union_loss :
    (∑ _i ∈ ({0, 1} : Finset ℕ),
        statDist ((Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10) ∪ ((Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10).image (· + 1)))
          (unif (Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10)) (unif ((Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10).image (· + 1))))
      ≤ ({0, 1} : Finset ℕ).card • ((1 : ℚ) / 10) := by
  have hsim : HintTranscriptSimulatable (Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10) ({0, 1} : Finset ℕ)
      (fun _ => (· + 1)) ((1 : ℚ) / 10) := by
    intro _ _
    have hinj : Function.Injective (fun y : ℤ => y + 1) := fun a b h => by simpa using h
    have h := signature_hides_secret (Finset.Ico (0:ℤ) 10) (· + 1) hinj (by decide) 1 (by decide)
    simpa using h
  exact hint_mlwe_hybrid_leakage _ _ _ _ hsim

/-- The concrete loss is the honest number `Q·(B/M) = 2·(1/10) = 1/5`. -/
theorem concrete_loss_value : (({0, 1} : Finset ℕ).card • ((1 : ℚ) / 10)) = 1 / 5 := by
  rw [show ({0, 1} : Finset ℕ).card = 2 from by decide, nsmul_eq_mul]
  norm_num

/-- **Reduction non-vacuity (the predicate has content).** Over `ZMod 5` (zero seminorm — every element is
`0`-short) the short secret `s = 3` explains the public key `t = 3 = id·3`, so `HintRecoverable` is
INHABITED: `HintMLWEHard` is genuinely FALSE here, not vacuously true. -/
theorem exHintRecoverable :
    HintRecoverable (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 0 (3 : ZMod 5) :=
  ⟨3, by decide, by simp⟩

/-- …hence `HintMLWEHard` FAILS on this instance — the assumption is a real constraint. -/
theorem exHint_not_hard :
    ¬ HintMLWEHard (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 0 (3 : ZMod 5) :=
  fun h => h exHintRecoverable

/-- **The reduction FIRES forward.** The recovered secret `s = 3` is a genuine MLWE witness (`t = id·3 + 0`)
— so `hint_mlwe_reduces_to_mlwe`'s contrapositive moves a real object, and MLWE is not hard here either. -/
theorem exHint_yields_mlwe_witness :
    ∃ s' : ZMod 5, nrm s' ≤ 0 ∧ ∃ e : ZMod 5, nrm e ≤ 0 ∧
      (3 : ZMod 5) = (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) s' + e :=
  hint_recovery_yields_mlwe_witness (LinearMap.id : ZMod 5 →ₗ[ZMod 5] ZMod 5) 0 3 3 (by decide) (by simp)
