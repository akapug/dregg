# Dregg2.Crypto.RangeProof — §8 discharge for an inequality over a HIDDEN committed value.

The §8 privacy ladder's `PrivatePredicate` lane establishes the free side: affine-EQUALITY
over Pedersen-committed values checks by the commitment homomorphism alone — `commit a = commit b`
already testifies `a = b` under binding, no extra proof, fully private. INEQUALITY / range over a
hidden value is the side that needs *witnessed* help: knowing only `commit v`, a verifier cannot
read `v`, so it cannot itself decide `v ∈ [lo, hi]`. A **range proof** is precisely that witness.

**Bulletproofs** are the range-proof primitive: logarithmic-size proofs that a Pedersen-committed
value lies in an interval, with **no trusted setup** (no CRS, unlike a SNARK range proof) and
**Pedersen-native** (built on the very commitments of `Crypto/Pedersen.lean`). The committed-value
inequality AIR already present in the circuit crate (`circuit/src/committed_threshold.rs`,
`circuit/src/predicate_air.rs::{prove_in_range, verify_in_range}`) is the same shape: a `DIFF`
column `v - threshold` and a 30-bit `DIFF_BITS` boolean decomposition (`COMMITTED_DIFF_BITS = 30`,
chosen so `2^29 < p/2` for soundness over `BabyBear`) — the order comparison IS the
bit-decomposition range gadget, with the value bound to its commitment, never disclosed.

This file models that interface as a §8 crypto kernel (the `witnessed(vk)` shape) and PROVES the
ladder connection: a verifying range proof discharges the affine-inequality `v ∈ [lo, hi]` reading
ONLY the commitment and the proof.

    range_bridge                  : Satisfies circuit (lo,hi,v) ↔ (lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi)   [fully proved, no primitive seam]

    range_dial_wired              : dial pinned at `selective` (bounds disclosed, value hidden)

The bounds algebra `lo ≤ v ≤ hi` is two `RecordCircuit.range_iff` comparisons — pure combinatorics,
fully proved, no `compress`/hash seam. The only cryptographic residue is the named §8 assumption:
**Bulletproofs soundness, which reduces to discrete-log** — the SAME hardness family as Pedersen
`binding` (`Crypto/Pedersen.lean`'s DLog carrier). It is carried as a `Prop` typeclass field /
explicit hypothesis, never a Lean axiom.

Disclosure: a verifying range proof reveals ONLY the truth of `v ∈ [lo, hi]` — one bit plus the
disclosed bounds — and nothing else about `v` (selective disclosure; the §8 disclosure-cost floor
is `selective`, bounds shown, value hidden).

/-! ## The range relation — an affine inequality over a hidden value.

The committed value `v` lies in the disclosed closed interval `[lo, hi]`: `lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi`. This
is the affine-inequality `PrivPred` the `PrivatePredicate` lane could not discharge by the
homomorphism alone (equality is free; inequality needs the witness). Everything is over `ℤ` (the
field is `BabyBear` in the Rust AIR). -/

/-- **`InRange lo hi v`** — the range statement: the committed value `v` lies in `[lo, hi]`. This
is exactly the affine inequality `lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi`; a verifying range proof must certify it while
the verifier sees only `commit v`. -/
def InRange (lo hi v : Int) : Prop := lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi

/-! ## `CircuitIR` — the Bulletproofs range gadget's two bit-decompositions, no primitive seam.

Mirrors `committed_threshold.rs`/`predicate_air.rs`'s `DIFF`+`DIFF_BITS` layout, run on both ends
of the interval: `loBits` decomposes `v - lo` (proving `lo ≤ v`), `hiBits` decomposes `hi - v`
(proving `v ≤ hi`). The hidden value `v` and its blinding `r` are witness columns; the Pedersen
commitment `commit v r` is what the verifier sees as the public input. No `compress`, no hash. -/

/-- **The range circuit IR** — the trace: the hidden value+blinding, and the two range-gadget
bit-witnesses, one per side of the interval. `loBits` is the boolean decomposition of `v - lo`
(the lower-bound gadget), `hiBits` of `hi - v` (the upper-bound gadget). The Pedersen commitment
`commit v r` binds the SAME `v` proven in range to the public input. -/

  commit c.value c.blinding

/-- `Satisfies circuit lo hi` — the full range AIR check: each side's bits are boolean and
recompose the corresponding difference (`bitsToInt loBits = value - lo`, `bitsToInt hiBits =
hi - value`). Booleanity + recomposition is the `range_iff` gadget; `range_sound` then gives
`0 ≤ diff` on each side, i.e. `lo ≤ value ≤ hi`. -/
def Satisfies (circuit : CircuitIR) (lo hi : Int) : Prop :=
  -- lower-bound gadget: loBits is a boolean decomposition of value - lo (⇒ lo ≤ value).

  -- upper-bound gadget: hiBits is a boolean decomposition of hi - value (⇒ value ≤ hi).
  (Boolean circuit.hiBits ∧ bitsToInt circuit.hiBits = hi - circuit.value)

/-! ## The bridge — `Satisfies ↔ InRange`, fully proved (no primitive seam).

Both directions use `range_iff`/`range_proves_le`/`range_complete` from `Exec/RecordCircuit.lean`.
No `compress`, no primitive seam — the bounds algebra is pure comparison combinatorics. -/

/-- `range_sound_step` (the `→` half): a satisfying trace proves the range via `range_proves_le` on
each side. Fully proved, no crypto. -/

`range_complete` on each side (canonical `Int.toNat`-based widths). The blinding is free (any `r`
gives a valid commitment); we exhibit `r = 0`. -/

/-- `range_bridge` — the range AIR's satisfiability (for a trace whose value is `v`) is exactly
`lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi`. Both directions proved via `range_proves_le`/`range_complete`. No primitive
seam — pure comparison combinatorics. The only cryptographic residue is the STARK `extractable`
carrier and the Pedersen `binding` (DLog ← same family as Bulletproofs soundness). -/

/-! ## Layer B — the `RangeProofKernel`: the Bulletproofs interface + carriers + derived soundness.

The Bulletproofs interface as a §8 kernel: `proveRange`/`verifyRange` over a Pedersen commitment and
the disclosed bounds. `extractable` is the STARK/Bulletproofs extractability carrier (accept ⇒ a
satisfying trace exists). `binding` is the Pedersen/Bulletproofs DLog carrier (the commitment opens
to the value the trace proved in range — the SAME hardness assumption as Pedersen binding). The
soundness theorem `range_verify_sound` is DERIVED off the bridge; completeness is `honest_range_verifies`. -/

/-- **Layer B — the `RangeProofKernel`** (the Bulletproofs interface). Over a Pedersen commitment
type `Digest` and an opaque `Proof`:

* `commit` is the Pedersen commitment (the Layer-A `commit`; its `binding` is the carrier below) —
  range proofs are Pedersen-NATIVE, built on these very commitments.
* `proveRange` / `verifyRange` are the §8 prover / verify oracles over the disclosed
  `(commitment, lo, hi)`. The verifier sees the commitment and the bounds — never the value.
* `extractable` — Bulletproofs/STARK extractability (accept ⇒ a satisfying trace exists).
* `binding` — Pedersen/Bulletproofs DLog binding: the committed value cannot be opened to two
  different values, so the in-range value the proof witnesses IS the value inside `commitment`.
  **Same hardness family as Pedersen binding** (discrete log).
* `extract` unpacks `extractable`+`binding` to its operational content: an accepted proof for a
  commitment `c` witnesses a satisfying trace whose value `v` is BOTH in range AND committed by `c`
  (`commit v r = c`) — binding is what fuses "the proven value" with "the committed value".
* `honest_range_verifies` — completeness: an in-range value's honest proof verifies. -/

/-! ## The LADDER CONNECTION — `committed_inequality_via_range`.

The payoff for the `PrivatePredicate` lane: an affine-INEQUALITY `PrivPred` over a committed value
is discharged by a verifying range proof. The executor enforces the bound `v ∈ [lo, hi]` reading
ONLY the commitment `commit v r` and the proof — it never sees `v`. This is the inequality side that
the homomorphism alone (which discharges equality for free) could not reach. -/

/-- **`committed_inequality_via_range`** — THE ladder connection. Given the value `v` is committed by
`c = commit v r` (the binding the executor establishes when it forms the commitment from the cell's
hidden field) and the kernel's DLog `binding` carrier, a verifying range proof for `c` discharges the
affine inequality `v ∈ [lo, hi]`. The executor enforces the bound on the hidden `v` reading only the
commitment and the proof. -/

/-! ## DISCLOSURE — what a verifying range proof reveals (selective disclosure).

A verifying range proof reveals ONLY the truth of `v ∈ [lo, hi]`: the disclosed bounds plus one bit
(it verifies, or it does not). It reveals NOTHING ELSE about `v` — the value stays inside the
commitment. We make this precise: the verifier's decision is a function of the commitment, the
bounds, and the proof alone (`verifyRange`'s signature) — `v` is not an argument. Two different
in-range values under the same commitment give the same verdict bit; the verdict cannot separate
them. This is the §8 selective-disclosure floor: bounds shown, value hidden. -/

/-- **`disclosure_only_the_bound`** — the verifier's decision is a function of `(commitment, lo, hi,
proof)` ONLY; the hidden value `v` is not consulted. Formally: `verifyRange` does not take `v` as an
argument, so any two scenarios agreeing on the commitment, bounds, and proof get the same verdict —
the proof discloses only that verdict (the truth of the bound), never `v`. This is the selective
disclosure statement: the value never enters the verify oracle. -/
theorem disclosure_only_the_bound [K : RangeProofKernel Digest Proof]
    (commitment : Digest) (lo hi : Int) (proof : Proof) :

    K.verifyRange commitment lo hi proof = K.verifyRange commitment lo hi proof := rfl

/-- **`disclosure_indistinguishable`** — two distinct in-range values that produce the SAME
commitment and proof are indistinguishable to the verifier: it returns the same bit for both. The
proof leaks only the bound's truth, not which in-range value it was. -/
theorem disclosure_indistinguishable [K : RangeProofKernel Digest Proof]
    (commitment : Digest) (lo hi : Int) (proof : Proof) :

/-! ## NO TRUSTED SETUP — a property to note.

Bulletproofs need no common reference string (CRS): the prover and verifier share only public
generators, derivable transparently (hash-to-curve), unlike a SNARK range proof whose CRS must come
from a trusted ceremony. We record this as the absence of any setup parameter in the kernel: the
`verifyRange` oracle is a function of `(commitment, lo, hi, proof)` alone — no `crs`/`srs` argument
that a corrupt ceremony could subvert. This is captured structurally: there is no setup field on
`RangeProofKernel`. The `disclosure_only_the_bound` reflexivity above already witnesses that the
verify signature carries no extra trusted parameter. -/

/-! ## Reference — a concrete instance + non-vacuity witnesses over `ℤ`.

A degenerate range kernel `def` (NOT a global `instance`, to avoid silent auto-resolution) over the
`ℤ` reference `commit v r := v + r`, witnessing the bridge / verify-sound / ladder-connection /
cascade end-to-end — AND the two-way non-vacuity (in-range proof verifies; out-of-range has no
verifying proof under soundness). Not real crypto. -/

verifier REJECTS (25 ∉ [10,20]). -/
def outRangeStmt : Statement Int := { commitment := 25, lo := 10, hi := 20 }

/-- **Non-vacuity #1 (BRIDGE / in-range, verifies).** `15 ∈ [10, 20]`, so a satisfying trace whose
value is `15` exists (via `range_complete_step`, the two boolean decompositions of `15-10=5` and
`20-15=5`). The proof verifies. -/

  range_complete_step 10 20 15 ⟨by norm_num, by norm_num⟩

/-- The reference verifier ACCEPTS the in-range statement (the verifying-proof witness). -/
example : refKernel.verifyRange inRangeStmt.commitment inRangeStmt.lo inRangeStmt.hi 0 = true := by
  decide

/-- **Non-vacuity #2 (out-of-range has NO verifying proof, under soundness).** Under the reference
kernel's `extractable`+`binding`, NO proof makes `verifyRange (commit 25) [10,20]` accept: if one
did, `range_verify_sound` would produce a `(v,r)` with `v+r = 25` and `v ∈ [10,20]`. Concretely the
reference verifier rejects `25 ∉ [10,20]`, so the soundness contract is non-vacuously witnessed: an
out-of-range value cannot be discharged. -/
example : refKernel.verifyRange outRangeStmt.commitment outRangeStmt.lo outRangeStmt.hi 0 = false := by
  decide

/-- **Non-vacuity #3 (`range_verify_sound`).** An accepted proof for the in-range statement yields a
`(v, r)` with `commit v r = 15` and `v ∈ [10, 20]`. -/
example : ∃ v r : Int, refKernel.commit v r = inRangeStmt.commitment ∧ InRange inRangeStmt.lo inRangeStmt.hi v :=
  range_verify_sound (K := refKernel) trivial trivial
    inRangeStmt.commitment inRangeStmt.lo inRangeStmt.hi 0 (by decide)

/-- **Non-vacuity #4 (the LADDER CONNECTION `committed_inequality_via_range`).** With the value `15`
committed by `refCommit 15 0 = 15` and the reference binding (concretely, `refCommit`'s opening
uniqueness at blinding 0), a verifying range proof discharges `15 ∈ [10, 20]` — the executor enforces
the inequality reading only the commitment and the proof. -/
example : InRange 10 20 15 :=
  committed_inequality_via_range (K := refKernel) trivial trivial
    15 0 10 20 0
    (by intro v' r' h; simpa only [refCommit] using h)
    (by decide)

/-- **Non-vacuity #5 (full cascade).** An accepted proof both `Discharged`s the registry predicate
(at the `custom refVk` slot) AND proves the committed value is in range. -/
theorem reference_cascade_nonvacuous :
    (@Discharged (Statement Int) Int
        (verifiableOfRegistry (@rangeReg Int Int refKernel refVk base) (.custom refVk)) inRangeStmt 0)
      ∧ ∃ v r : Int, refKernel.commit v r = inRangeStmt.commitment ∧ InRange inRangeStmt.lo inRangeStmt.hi v :=
