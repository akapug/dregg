# `Dregg2.Crypto.FloorGames` — the `*HardQuant` floors RESTATED as the standard cryptographic games,
with the problem IN the statement, and the DILEMMA localized to its one real cause.

## What was wrong (proved in `HardQuantVacuity`, 2026-07-16)

The five `*HardQuant` floors were **one `Prop`**:

    def MSISHardQuant {S : Type*} (adv : S → Ensemble) : Prop := ∀ s, Negl (adv s)

`Iff.rfl` five ways. None mentioned a lattice, a curve, a hash or `IsMSISSolution`; the problem lived
entirely in the NAME. `HardQuantVacuity.the_vrf_keystone_accepts_the_hash_floor` passed a
`HashCRHardQuant` proof into the slot `VrfRegrounded.lattice_vrf_uniqueness_advantage_bound` declares as
`MSISHardQuant` and it TYPECHECKED. The old shape survives, doc-marked, as
`ProbCrypto.MSISHardQuantShape` and friends — the record matters, and those teeth are the regression.

## What this file does

**§1 — ONE SCHEMA, MANY PROBLEMS.** A `Game` is a λ-indexed finite `Inst`ance space, an `Ans`wer space,
and a **win relation** `wins l i a`. An `Adversary` is `run : ∀ l, Inst l → Ans l`; its `gameAdv` is the
`winProb` — the fraction of instances at parameter `l` on which it wins. This is the tree's existing
`ProbCrypto.winProb`/`ConcreteSecurity.Negl` machinery; nothing probabilistic is invented.

    def Hard (G : Game) (Eff : Adversary G → Prop) : Prop := ∀ A, Eff A → Negl (gameAdv G A)

The five floors are this schema at **five different `Game`s**, each carrying its problem: `IsMSISSolution`
(§3), the MLWE secret (§4), a discrete log (§5), a hash collision (§6, reusing
`HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`), and the LWE-vs-uniform distinguishing gap (§7). The old defect —
five names, one `Prop` — is gone at the TYPE level: `MSISHardQuant F Eff` and `HashCRHardQuant H Eff'`
are `Hard` at incomparable `Game`s, so the wrong-floor proof no longer elaborates
(`HardQuantVacuity` §6 is the permanent tooth).

**§2 — THE COLLAPSE, and it decides the dilemma.** `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`:

    Hard G (fun _ => True)  ↔  Negl (solvableFrac G)

At the **unrestricted** adversary class, a game floor IS the (probabilistic) EXISTENCE floor — the
`Classical.choice` adversary that picks a winning answer wherever one exists wins on exactly the solvable
instances. So the sweep's Horn A is **not an artifact of `msisSolverAdv`, and not an artifact of the old
shape**: it is a theorem about EVERY unrestricted-adversary formulation, this one included. At a
compressing MSIS instance solutions exist at every coin, so `MSISHardQuant F ⊤` is FALSE
(`msisHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing`), exactly as `Lattice.MSISHard` is.

⚑ **This refutes the repair the sweep itself named.** `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant F` is
definitionally `HashCRHardQuant F ⊤` (`collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top`), so
`collisionResistant_false_of_compressing` proves the "proper keyed computational floor" — the pattern
`VACUITY-SWEEP.md` §Finding-1 prescribes as *"the correct pattern already in the tree"* — is itself FALSE
at deployed parameters, for the same pigeonhole reason, laundered through `Classical.choice`. A keyed
family does not fix it. Copying that pattern to the lattice floors would have been the FOURTH costume.

**§8 — WHAT ACTUALLY ESCAPES, and the residual, named.** The quantifier `∀ A : Adversary G` ranges over
every Lean function, and a function may pick a solution it could never compute. Hardness quantifies over
**EFFICIENT** adversaries; the escape is therefore the `Eff` parameter, and NOTHING ELSE escapes
(`hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is an `↔`: no restatement of the win relation can help). What the
repair buys is exact and it is not nothing:

  1. the problem is IN the statement (`msisSolver_wins_iff` etc. unfold `wins` to `IsMSISSolution`),
  2. the floors are pairwise non-interchangeable (five `Game`s, not one `Prop`),
  3. consumers must EXHIBIT a reduction (`VrfRegrounded.vrf_uniqueness_adversary_is_msis_solver`
     constructs the solver and PROVES the advantage inequality — the reduction is in the proof, not the
     docstring),
  4. the dilemma is localized to ONE named object, `Eff`, with both poles PROVED here: `Eff := ⊤` makes
     every floor FALSE at deployed parameters (`hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`), `Eff := ⊥` makes it
     vacuous (`hard_bot_vacuous`).

⚑ **THE RESIDUAL, stated precisely and NOT closed here: the tree has no cost model.** `Eff` cannot be
given honest content by anything in this repository — `Computable` does not restrict it (every instance is
a finite object, so brute-force search is computable: `computable_does_not_restrict`), and Mathlib has no
polynomial-time model over an arbitrary carrier. So `Eff` is carried as a PARAMETER, and every consumer
that discharges a floor leaf carries an `Eff`-membership obligation for the solver its reduction builds.
That obligation is the honest name for "the reduction is efficient". It is undischarged, it is labelled
at every use site, and it is the whole remaining gap between this floor and a cryptographic assumption.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no `def …Hard`
used as a hypothesis. Every verdict is PROVED. `Classical.choice` is not incidental here — it is the
adversary in §2, and it is why §8's residual is real.

/-! ## §1 — the schema: a λ-indexed security GAME, its adversaries, and their advantage.

Nothing here is new machinery: `winProb` is `ProbCrypto`'s finite counting probability and `Negl` is
`ConcreteSecurity`'s. What is new — and what the old floors lacked — is that a `Game` CARRIES its win
relation, so a floor stated over it mentions its problem. -/

/-- **A λ-indexed security game.** At each security parameter `l`: a FINITE, inhabited instance space
`Inst l` (the challenge, sampled uniformly — for MSIS the public matrix, for hash-CR the key, for DL the
challenge point), an answer space `Ans l` (the solution the adversary outputs), and the **win relation**
`wins l i a` — the actual problem. `winsDec` makes the win event a genuine finite counting event.

The instance space is what makes the floor λ-indexed and therefore non-degenerate: a single-instance
"∃ efficient adversary" collapses to "∃ solution" by non-uniform hardcoding, which is exactly the trap
`CryptoFloorTeeth` §5 documents. -/

  /-- The instance (challenge) space at parameter `l`, sampled uniformly. -/

  winsDec : ∀ l (i : Inst l) (a : Ans l), Decidable (wins l i a)

/-- **An adversary against `G`.** It receives the instance and outputs an answer. NOTE what this type does
NOT say: nothing bounds its resources. `Adversary G` is every Lean function `∀ l, G.Inst l → G.Ans l`,
including ones that pick an answer by `Classical.choice` — which is precisely why §2's collapse holds and
why the `Eff` parameter of `Hard` is not decoration. -/

/-- **THE FLOOR SCHEMA.** Every adversary IN THE CLASS `Eff` has negligible advantage at the game `G`.

Two parameters, and both are load-bearing:

  * `G` carries the PROBLEM. `Hard G₁ Eff` and `Hard G₂ Eff'` are different `Prop`s for different games —
    this is what makes the five floors non-interchangeable, and it is what the old shape lacked.
  * `Eff` carries the RESOURCE BOUND — "efficient". It is a PARAMETER because this repository has no cost
    model (§8). At `Eff := ⊤` the floor is the existence floor and is FALSE at deployed parameters (§2);
    at `Eff := ⊥` it is vacuous (`hard_bot_vacuous`). A floor is exactly as honest as its `Eff`, and no
    restatement of `wins` can substitute for one. -/
def Hard (G : Game) (Eff : Adversary G → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ A : Adversary G, Eff A → Negl (gameAdv G A)

/-! ## §2 — THE COLLAPSE: at the unrestricted class, a game floor IS the existence floor.

This is the load-bearing theorem of the file. The sweep proved Horn A of its dilemma for ONE `adv`
(`FloorBridge.msisSolverAdv`) and concluded "no third instantiation exists **in the current shape**". The
`↔` below says more, and it says it about the REPAIRED shape: for ANY game whatsoever, quantifying over
all adversaries makes the floor equivalent to "the solvable fraction is negligible". Restating the win
relation cannot escape the dilemma. Only `Eff` can. -/

/-- **An instance is SOLVABLE** iff some answer wins on it — the event `∃ solution`, as a counted Bool.
(`Classical.propDecidable` supplies the instance; whether a solution exists is not in general decidable,
and that is exactly the point of the game form.) -/

/-- **⚑ THE COLLAPSE — a floor over ALL adversaries IS the probabilistic existence floor.**

    Hard G (fun _ => True)  ↔  Negl (solvableFrac G)

Left-to-right is the `choiceAdv`: it is an adversary, so the floor bounds it, and its advantage is the
solvable fraction. Right-to-left is domination: no adversary wins where nothing wins.

**This is the dilemma, generalized and PROVED for the repaired shape.** The sweep's Horn A blamed a
particular `adv` (`FloorBridge.msisSolverAdv`, the solution-indexed family) and its conclusion — "the only
MSIS-tied `adv` collapses to the Boolean floor" — reads like an accident of that instantiation. It is not.
Tie the advantage to the problem in ANY way at all, quantify over all adversaries, and you get the
existence floor back. `Classical.choice` is the adversary; the win relation cannot see it coming. The one
hypothesis that is doing work here is `hne` (some answer exists to fall back on), and it is satisfied by
every real game.

So: **the escape is not in the shape of `wins`. It is `Eff`, and only `Eff`** — the standard form's
"for every EFFICIENT adversary". Which this repository cannot state (§8). -/

the floor holds for ANY game, including a completely broken one. Stated so that the `Eff` parameter cannot

solvable fraction is `1` and the collapse (§2) refutes the floor.

This is the deployed situation: a real MSIS matrix is compressing — that is WHY the problem is a hard

/-! ## §6 — hash collision resistance, and ⚑ THE REFUTATION OF THE SWEEP'S OWN PRESCRIBED REPAIR.

`VACUITY-SWEEP.md` §Finding-1's REPAIR says: *"`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` is the correct
pattern already in the tree — a keyed family whose `wins` predicate is definitionally a genuine collision
of the real function, so the advantage cannot be satisfied by an unrelated `adv`. The lattice floors need
the `CollisionResistant` treatment."*

Half of that is right: it carries its problem, and this file gives the lattice floors exactly that. The
other half is FALSE, and §2 proves it. `CollisionResistant F` quantifies over ALL `CollisionFinder`s, and
a compressing family has a collision at every key, so the choice-finder wins with probability `1`. The
"proper computational floor" is FALSE at deployed parameters — the identical fate its own file proved for
the injective floors it replaced, reached by the identical pigeonhole, one `Classical.choice` later. -/

COMPRESSING — at every parameter and key some two distinct inputs collide, which is the defining property
of a hash and is forced by pigeonhole whenever `|Input| > |Out|` — then `CollisionResistant F` is FALSE.

The `Classical.choice` finder that outputs a collision at every key is a `CollisionFinder`: that structure
bounds nothing. Its advantage is the constant `1`.

`HashFloorHonesty`'s own header says of its predecessor: *"the pre-existing non-vacuity witnesses give
FALSE COMFORT — they satisfy the floor with a toy injective sponge, while the REAL compressing Poseidon2
refutes it."* `idFamily_CR` (its satisfiability tooth) is the identity hash. `mod2Family` — its own
example of a genuinely compressing family — is NOT collision-resistant under this theorem, though
`mod2_dumb_negligible` shows only that ONE dumb finder fails on it. The sentence applies to the successor,
for the third time in a row. This is the reason §3–§7 do not simply copy the pattern. -/

`CollisionResistant` floor is FALSE: `mod2_dumb_negligible` proved a DUMB finder has advantage `0`, which
is true and says nothing about the floor, because the floor quantifies over ALL finders including the one
that outputs `(0, 2)`. Satisfiable-by-a-toy, false-at-a-real-hash — the sweep's own diagnosis, applied to

/-! ## §7 — decisional MLWE: the LWE-vs-uniform gap, with both worlds PINNED.

`ProbCrypto.DecisionFamily` carries two arbitrary `Type`s and two arbitrary accept predicates — its "real
world" is not required to be an LWE sample and its "uniform world" is not required to be uniform. Its own
docstring says the *intended* `adv` is a `DecisionFamily.adv`; the sweep flagged exactly that word. Here
the real world IS `A·s + e` for a short secret and error, the uniform world IS the sample module, and the
distinguisher is ONE function applied to both — so the gap it measures is the LWE-vs-uniform gap. -/

/-- **A decisional-MLWE family.** The real world is an `MLWEFamily`'s keygen randomness; the uniform world
is the sample module itself, sampled uniformly. The distinguisher sees a sample module element in both
worlds and cannot tell which experiment produced it — that is what makes the two accept probabilities
comparable, and it is what the old `DecisionFamily` could not express. -/

  /-- The sample module is inhabited. -/
  sampleNe : ∀ l, Nonempty (base.N l)

/-- **A decisional distinguisher**: ONE accept predicate on sample-module elements, at each parameter. It
is applied to the real sample `A·s + e` and to a uniform element — the SAME function, which is what makes
`distinguishAdv` an LWE-vs-uniform gap rather than two unrelated numbers. -/

  /-- The distinguisher's accept decision on a sample-module element. -/

LWE-vs-uniform gap is negligible. The real world is pinned to genuine MLWE samples (`mlweFamily_isSample`)
and the uniform world to the sample module; the word "intended" no longer appears.

⚑ This floor does NOT ride the `Game` schema: a distinguishing advantage is a DIFFERENCE of two
probabilities, not a `winProb`, so §2's collapse does not apply to it — a distinguisher cannot appeal to
`Classical.choice` to know which world it is in. That asymmetry is real and it is the reason the decisional
floor is the healthiest of the five. It is still `Eff`-parameterized, because an unbounded distinguisher
that decides "is `t` of the form `A·s + e` for short `s`, `e`?" by exhaustive search has advantage close to
`1` whenever the sample space is not saturated. -/

/-! ## §8 — the residual, named: THE TREE HAS NO COST MODEL, and `Eff` is where that lives.

§2 proves the escape is `Eff` and only `Eff`. So: can `Eff` be given content HERE, over the definitions
this repository already has? The honest answer is no, and the two candidate answers fail for reasons worth
recording rather than rediscovering.

  * **Computability does not restrict the adversary.** Every instance space in every game above is a
    FINITE type, so "search all answers and return a winning one" is a total computable function of the
    instance. `Eff := Computable` therefore contains the choice adversary's computable twin and the floor
    stays false. The theorem below is the general form: a finite `Ans` makes the winner explicitly
    constructible with no choice at all.
  * **Polynomial time is not available.** Mathlib has no cost semantics over an arbitrary carrier — no
    `PPT`, no machine model, nothing to say `Eff A` means "A runs in time `poly(l)`". Stating it needs a
    deep embedding of the adversary (SSProve/EasyCrypt/FCF each carry one; this tree does not). That is
    the missing machinery, and inventing a shallow imitation of it here would be the fourth costume.

So the floors above are the standard cryptographic games **relative to an adversary class**, and the class
is a parameter with no content. That is strictly better than what they replace — the problem is in the
statement, the five floors are distinct, and the reductions must be exhibited — and it is strictly less
than a cryptographic assumption. Both halves of that sentence are load-bearing. -/

/-- **THE EXISTENCE OF A SOLUTION IS A FINITE SEARCH.** When the answer space is finite — and every
deployed one is: a lattice vector over a finite ring, a pair of hash inputs from a bounded domain, a
scalar below the group order — "does this instance have a solution?" is DECIDABLE, by exhaustive search
over `Ans l`. No oracle, no `Classical.choice`: the winner is found by looking.

This is the second half of §8's point, and it is why `Eff := Computable` cannot rescue the floor. The
adversary that brute-forces every instance is a perfectly ordinary total computable function; what
disqualifies it as an attack is that the search is ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE, and "large" is a statement about
COST. This tree can say `Fintype`; it cannot say `2^128`. That gap is the residual, and it is not a gap
this lane can close by restating anything. -/
