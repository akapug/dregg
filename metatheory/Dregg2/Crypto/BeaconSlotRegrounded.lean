# `Dregg2.Crypto.BeaconSlotRegrounded` — the `HonestSlotCR` consumers RE-GROUNDED off the
FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floor onto a REAL collision game carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `HonestSlotCR` site)

`RandomnessBeacon.HonestSlotCR b := ∀ rest c c', b.combine (c ::ₘ rest) = b.combine (c' ::ₘ rest) →
c = c'` is stated as **injectivity** of the honest slot. Fix `rest` and it IS
`Function.Injective (fun c => b.combine (c ::ₘ rest))` — a map `Ct → O` from the contribution type to
the beacon output. For the deployed hash-combine that map is COMPRESSING, so the floor is **FALSE at
deployed parameters by pigeonhole** (§1), and `honest_makes_unbiasable` /
`bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr` are **VACUOUSLY TRUE** there. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proofs are
clean; the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

## ⚑ THE FALSITY HAS A DIFFERENT SHAPE HERE THAN AT ITS SIBLINGS — and being precise about why is
part of the repair.

`KeySetCR`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and `CompressionCR` are all refuted by the **counting core**
(`HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range`): their DOMAINS are structurally infinite (`List
Key`, `List ℤ`, `State × List ℤ`) and no assumption about the deployment is needed beyond a bounded
range. `HonestSlotCR` is NOT like that. With `rest` fixed its domain is `Ct` — ONE contribution, a
fixed-width value, not a list — and nothing makes `Ct` infinite. Forcing the infinitude core onto it
would be assuming a deployment nobody runs.

So the honest refutation is by **COMPRESSION**, not by infinitude:
`honestSlotCR_false_of_compressing` uses `Fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt` under
`Fintype.card O < Fintype.card Ct` — the SAME shape as
`HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`, and for the same reason: both carriers compress a
fixed-width input into a fixed-width digest, and `|O| < |Ct|` is the DEFINING property of that, not an
extra hypothesis. The infinite-`Ct` variant is stated too (`honestSlotCR_false_of_infinite_ct`), for
the unbounded-contribution deployment, via the counting core — but it is the secondary form here,
where at the siblings it is the primary one.

## ⚑ THE "NOT A BESPOKE CARRIER" DEFENSE DOES NOT RESCUE IT — and that is a real finding.

`RandomnessBeacon`'s header argues at length that `HonestSlotCR` is *"NOT bespoke: it is DISCHARGED by
the imported `HashCR` (`honestSlotCR_of_hashcr`) … so the honest slot bottoms out at the one named
hash carrier, the true floor, with no bespoke beacon carrier."* That is TRUE and it is NOT a defense.
`HashCR` is one of the FOUR floors `HashFloorHonesty` already proved FALSE at deployed parameters
(`hashCR_false_of_compressing`, its TOOTH 3). Bottoming out at a false floor is not grounding; it is
inheriting the emptiness one level down. §1 proves this rather than asserting it:
`honestSlotCR_discharge_hypothesis_is_false` refutes the very `HashCR cr` that
`honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` consumes, at a compressing multiset-hash — so BOTH the carrier and the
carrier it reduces to are unsatisfiable together, and the reduction between them transports nothing.

`sumBeacon_cr` gives FALSE COMFORT of exactly the shape `HashFloorHonesty`'s header predicts: it
satisfies the floor with `combine = Σ` over ALL of `ℤ` — an injective, NON-compressing "hash" (adding
a constant is a bijection). Toy witness satisfiable, real hash-combine false.

## The re-grounding (the `PreRotationKeySetRegrounded` pattern)

  * **§1 — FALSE AS NAMED**, by compression (primary) and by infinitude (secondary), plus the
    `HashCR`-bottoming-out finding, proved.
  * **§2 — the KEYED family.** `BeaconDeployment` bundles the deployed multiset hash-combine
    (`beaconOfHash`'s realization, the one `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` is about) with its
    domain-separation tag space (the effective key). `multisetHashFamily` lifts it to a
    `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`; `deployed_combine_is_family_instance` pins FAITHFULNESS.
  * **§3 — the BEACON BIAS GAME.** A biasing adversary is a first-class λ-indexed adversary: handed a
    sampled tag, it outputs the adversarial contribution multiset `rest` and two DISTINCT honest
    contributions, and WINS iff the beacon output is the SAME — i.e. it ABSORBED the honest randomness
    and the honest contribution no longer moves the beacon. That IS `bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr`'s
    content, as a game.
  * **§4 — THE REDUCTION.** `biasToCollisionFinder` maps a biasing adversary to a multiset-hash
    collision finder by consing each honest contribution onto its own `rest`; `bias_wins_imp` proves
    win-preservation via `Multiset.cons_inj_left` — the pure cancellation fact
    `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` already uses, now carrying the reduction instead of a false hypothesis.
    Note the adversary chooses `rest` per tag and the extractor follows it — the reduction is genuinely
    data-dependent, not a rename.
  * **§5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.** `honest_makes_unbiasable_advantage_bound` and
    `bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr_advantage_bound`: the Boolean "distinct honest contributions ALWAYS
    move the beacon" becomes "move it EXCEPT with negligible probability" — which is what a real
    collision-resistant combine can deliver, and what the FALSE injective floor was standing in for.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETER IS THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND IT IS UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the
UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, so it is FALSE wherever collisions
exist — and §1 proves they exist at the deployed combine. §7 instantiates both poles at THIS carrier:
`beaconSlot_floor_top_false_of_finite_out` (`Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at a bounded beacon output) and
`beaconSlot_floor_bot_vacuous` (`Eff := ⊥` is vacuous). So `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the open, at every
use site: this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow imitation would be
another costume. Hiding the `Eff` dependence is the disease; naming it is the repair.

## Non-fake

The floor is REFUTABLE (`brokenBeacon_floor_top_false`: a combine that ignores the contributions has a
finder winning at every tag, advantage `1`) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary). The OLD
`HonestSlotCR` consumers are KEPT untouched in `RandomnessBeacon`; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`;
no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the BEACON honest-slot lane. The sponge compression carrier is re-grounded in
`Crypto.SpongeCompressionRegrounded`; the pre-rotation key-set carrier in
`Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`. `Crypto.HashRandRefinement` consumes the same
`Multiset.cons_inj_left` shape against an injective `frameOutput` and is the next site for this
treatment.

/-! ## §1 — FALSE AS NAMED: the injective `HonestSlotCR` floor is refuted by a COMPRESSING combine.

⚑ Read the header: this carrier's falsity does NOT have the shape of its siblings'. With `rest` fixed
the honest slot is a map `Ct → O` between two fixed-width types, so the counting core has no infinite
domain to bite on. The honest refutation is `Fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt` under
`|O| < |Ct|` — which is not an extra hypothesis but the definition of a compressing combine. -/

/-- **⚑ TOOTH (the primary form) — `HonestSlotCR` is FALSE for any COMPRESSING combine.** If the
beacon output space is smaller than the contribution space — the defining property of a hash-combine,
and true of every real beacon (a 256-bit digest over contributions carrying more entropy than that, or
a BabyBear felt over anything at all) — then at EVERY fixed adversarial `rest`, two distinct honest
contributions give the same output, by pigeonhole. So the floor is not merely un-proven at the
deployed combine; it is provably FALSE there, and `honest_makes_unbiasable` /
`bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr` are vacuous at real parameters.

This is the SAME shape as `HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing` (its TOOTH 3), and that is
not a coincidence: §1's last tooth shows the two carriers are false TOGETHER. -/

genuine honest-slot collision — two DISTINCT honest contributions the beacon cannot tell apart. This

floor false (§7), and therefore what makes the `Eff` parameter load-bearing rather than decorative. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ TOOTH — THE "IT BOTTOMS OUT AT THE STANDARD `HashCR`" DEFENSE FAILS, PROVED.**

`RandomnessBeacon`'s header rests on `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr`: `HonestSlotCR (beaconOfHash cr)` is
DISCHARGED from `HermineHintMLWE.HashCR cr`, so — the argument goes — the honest slot is not a bespoke
carrier, it bottoms out at the one standard hash floor. The discharge is real. The defense is not:
`HashCR cr` for a multiset-hash into a BOUNDED output is itself FALSE, by the counting core over the
infinite `Multiset Ct`. It is `HashFloorHonesty`'s own TOOTH 3, at the very `cr` this file's beacon is
built from.

So the reduction `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` transports NOTHING at deployed parameters: it derives a
false conclusion from a false hypothesis, and both are vacuous. Bottoming out at a standard floor is
grounding only if the standard floor is satisfiable, and this one is not. That is the finding; this is
the proof of it. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the deployed form of the same.)** A beacon combine landing in a genuinely bounded
output type (a digest — a `Finite` type: every real one is) refutes the `HashCR` floor that
`honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` consumes. No bound, no modulus, no parameter: `Finite O` is the whole
hypothesis. -/

/-! ## §2 — the KEYED family: domain separation is the key.

The deployed combine is a FIXED unkeyed multiset hash; its effective key is the domain-separation tag
the beacon absorbs ahead of the contribution set (the standard keyed-from-unkeyed treatment). Modelling
that tag as the key is what stops the "hardcode a known collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed
floor. The family is over `Multiset Ct` — the honest realization `beaconOfHash` uses — so the game is
about the very function `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` reduces to. -/

/-- **The deployed beacon combine.** `hash t` is the tag-keyed multiset hash-combine
`H(t, c₁ ‖ … ‖ cₙ)` — the deployed fixed function at each domain-separation tag; `Tag` is the finite,
inhabited tag space the CR game samples; `deployedTag` is the tag the beacon computes at. -/

`HashCR` shape `honestSlotCR_of_hashcr` consumes, the floor `HonestSlotCR` bottoms out at — it would
discharge `CollisionResistant (multisetHashFamily D)` (no collisions ⟹ every finder's advantage `0`).
So the OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE at any
bounded output (§1), it was an EMPTY hypothesis. Nothing is lost re-grounding; a false hypothesis is
replaced by one a real combine can satisfy. -/

quantifies over, with an explicit adversary class. -/

its own adversarial contribution multiset `rest` — it committed first, so it chooses — together with
two DISTINCT honest contributions. It WINS iff the beacon output is the SAME on both: the honest
randomness was ABSORBED, the honest contribution no longer moves the beacon, and the adversary that
committed its part first has pinned the output.

That is exactly `bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr`'s content ("biasability is exactly a hash collision on the
honest slot") and the negation of `honest_makes_unbiasable`'s — as a game, with the problem IN the win
predicate rather than in a docstring. Note the adversary CHOOSES `rest` per tag; the floor is not
about one fixed adversarial aggregate. -/

collision finder by consing each of its two honest contributions onto the adversarial `rest` IT chose.

biaser wins, the extracted pair is a GENUINE collision of the deployed combine: the two committed
multisets are DISTINCT (`Multiset.cons_inj_left` — distinct honest contributions onto the same `rest`
give distinct multisets, the pure cancellation fact) while the beacon output is EQUAL (the bias
itself). The crypto content lives in a proof term, not in a sentence about one. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.

The Boolean keystones become advantage bounds, derived FROM the collision floor VIA the reduction. The
old statements are kept in `RandomnessBeacon`; these are their honest siblings. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `RandomnessBeacon.honest_makes_unbiasable`.**

Under the combine-collision floor at the game the reduction actually attacks, a biasing adversary whose
extracted finder is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an adversary that commits
its contributions first steers the beacon — makes the output insensitive to a distinct honest
contribution — only with negligible probability. The Boolean "distinct honest values ALWAYS yield
distinct outputs, so the honest contribution ALWAYS moves the beacon" becomes "moves it EXCEPT with
negligible probability" — which is what a real hash-combine can actually deliver, and what the FALSE
injective floor was standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the
bias game, the hypothesis about the collision game, and `bias_adv_le` is the only bridge (§6's canary
compiles that fact).

⚑ **`hEff` IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard "the reduction is efficient"
side condition, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The floor's honesty
is exactly its `Eff`'s, and §7 prices both poles: `⊤` makes it FALSE at a bounded output, `⊥`
vacuous. -/

as: an adversary exhibiting a bias IS, by the extractor, a combine collision finder — so under the
collision floor at that finder, bias happens only with negligible probability. The old theorem's
contrapositive shape is exactly this bound; what changes is that the hypothesis is now satisfiable and
the reduction is exhibited.

/-! ## §7 — the `Eff` parameter, PRICED: both poles proved at THIS carrier.

The sweep's deep result (`FloorGames` §2) says a game floor at the unrestricted class IS the existence
floor. Here is that theorem instantiated at the deployed combine, so a reader can price any `Eff`
exactly rather than take the residual on faith. -/

/-- **THE COLLISION THE `⊤`-POLE REFUTATION EATS.** At the multiset domain the counting core DOES fire
(the domain is genuinely infinite — `instInfiniteMultiset`), so a bounded-output combine has a genuine
collision at every tag. ⚑ Note the asymmetry with §1: the SLOT floor needed compression, the FAMILY's
floor needs only a bounded output. Both are true of every real beacon; they are different arguments and
saying which is which is the point. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` for a range-bounded combine.)** The real content,
and the reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded combine HAS a collision at every tag, so the
collision game is always solvable, so the floor at the unrestricted adversary class is FALSE — and
every consumer would be vacuous there. `Classical.choice` is the adversary and no restatement of the
win relation can see it coming. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem instead of a
promise. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the DEPLOYED form, and it needs NO parameters.)** A real beacon output is a digest: a

for ANY deployment, including a completely broken combine. Recorded HONESTLY: a satisfiability witness
is worth nothing without the refutation beside it, and these two poles together are what make `Eff` a
dial rather than a costume. -/

/-! ### The floor is REFUTABLE on a broken deployment (load-bearing, not `True`-shaped). -/

/-- A **broken** beacon deployment: the combine IGNORES the contributions entirely — the constant
`0` — so the adversary sets the beacon output outright and every pair of distinct contribution
multisets collides at every tag. This is `RandomnessBeacon.badBeaconOut`'s disease, as a deployment. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the floor is REFUTABLE.)** The broken deployment's collision game is solvable at every
tag (`{0} ≠ {1}`, both combine to `0`), so it has no unrestricted-class floor. So the floor is a
GENUINE constraint — a broken combine refutes it — not vacuously true. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the broken deployment also refutes `HonestSlotCR` as named.)** `brokenBeacon`'s beacon
FALSIFIES the injective slot floor outright — the honest contribution never moves the output — so
`HonestSlotCR` is a meaningful named proposition and not a relabelled `True`. Fired through
`RandomnessBeacon.bias_breaks_honest_slot_cr` itself: the OLD theorem is the tooth. -/

/-! ### The floor is SATISFIABLE (the connection to the keyed-family treatment). -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the keyed family is SATISFIABLE on an injective deployment.)** A deployment whose
per-tag combine is injective discharges `CollisionResistant (multisetHashFamily D)` — the honest floor
is REALIZABLE, unlike the injective `HonestSlotCR`/`HashCR` at deployed parameters. ⚑ Recorded with its
price: this is the `⊤`-class object, which §7's first tooth proves FALSE at a range-bounded (i.e. real)
combine. An injective combine is exactly the `sumBeacon`/`idMultisetHash` shape — a non-compressing
"hash" into all of `ℤ`, or the identity — and the satisfiability is honest only as a non-emptiness
check, never as evidence the deployed combine satisfies it. -/
