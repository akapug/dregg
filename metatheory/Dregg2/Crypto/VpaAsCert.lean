# Dregg2.Crypto.VpaAsCert — the VISIBLY-PUSHDOWN / nested-word rung of the certificate substrate.

`Crypto/Hypergraph` proved a RELATION-PARAMETRIC certificate: for ANY reduction relation
`R : α → α → Prop`, a locally-checkable CHAIN certificate `Cert R start goal c` exists IFF
`ReflTransGen R start goal` (`Hypergraph.bridge`). `Crypto/DfaAsCert` landed the REGULAR rung on it
(`R := delta`, a stackless step relation over configs); `Hypergraph.cfg_parse_via_reduction` lands the
CONTEXT-FREE rung (`R := g.Produces`, prover-chosen rule stack action). This file adds the THIRD sibling —
the VISIBLY-PUSHDOWN rung — so the regular/visibly-pushdown/context-free levels of the Chomsky hierarchy
all ride the SAME `Hypergraph.Cert` object, differing only in `R`:

    REGULAR       Cert delta        (no stack)                          -- DfaAsCert
    VISIBLY-PD    Cert R_vpa        (stack action = f(symbol CLASS))    -- THIS FILE
    CONTEXT-FREE  Cert g.Produces   (prover-chosen rule stack action)   -- Hypergraph

The visibly-pushdown discipline (Alur–Madhusudan): the input alphabet is partitioned
`Σ = Σ_call ⊎ Σ_return ⊎ Σ_internal`. The stack action is a function of the symbol's CLASS, not the
state: a call pushes exactly one symbol, a return pops exactly one, an internal touches nothing. Over a
FINITE alphabet (here the bracket grid `{op, cl, dat}`, `op = call`, `cl = return`, `dat = internal`)
classical VPL theory applies cleanly. The decisive consequence — proved here as `run_height` /
`stack_height_input_determined` — is that the STACK HEIGHT at every input position is a function of the
INPUT WORD ALONE (the running count of unmatched calls), INDEPENDENT of the run. That is the property the
regular rung (no stack) and the context-free rung (sentential-form length is NOT input-determined) both
lack, and it is the root of VPL's boolean closure, determinizability, and DECIDABLE EQUIVALENCE.

Objects:
    stepValid                     : the class-driven stack discipline (call push / return pop / internal none)
    R_vpa                         : the delta-shaped chaining relation over `(state, stack)` configs
    vchained_iff_chain            : `vchained` IS `Hypergraph.chain R_vpa` (definitional bridge)
    vpaAccepts_as_cert            : a VPA run IS a `Hypergraph.Cert R_vpa` + acceptance boundaries
    vpaAccepts_reduces            : an accepting run ⇒ `ReflTransGen R_vpa` (via `Hypergraph.bridge`)
    three_rungs_share_substrate   : regular ⊗ visibly-pushdown ⊗ context-free = ONE `Hypergraph.bridge`
    step_stack_length / run_height / stack_height_input_determined : the root VPL property

## Honest scope (per `docs/DESIGN-visibly-pushdown-reframe.md`)

This rung NAMES the templater's `Separated`/`Excludes` class as the visibly-nested boundary — it does NOT
dissolve the uniqueness / inverse wall. VPA determinism yields a unique RUN; unique DATA recovery still
needs the boundary-at-forced-position argument (`split_unique`), whose precondition — the delimiter is a
genuine return symbol, never hole content — IS `Excludes`, renamed not removed (assessment §2). What the
rung genuinely BUYS is (a) the substrate rung itself and (b) the PATH to a capability the general-CFG
substrate provably cannot have: **decidable template equivalence / inclusion** on the visibly-nested
fragment (CFL equivalence is undecidable; VPL equivalence is EXPTIME-decidable). Decidable equivalence is
NAMED here as the precisely-stated follow-on `run_height` enables — it is NOT proved in this lane, and
NOT sorry'd; see the residual note at the foot of the file.

/-! ## The finite visibly-pushdown alphabet + its class partition.

The bracket grid the Dyck circuit already pins (`dyck_stack.rs`, `symbol_grid`): `op` (opening `[`) is a
CALL, `cl` (closing `]`) is a RETURN, `dat` is INTERNAL data. FINITE alphabet ⇒ classical VPL theory
applies (the assessment §4.1: the marquee VPL wins transfer cleanly only to the finite fragment, which is
exactly the Dyck level). -/

def classOf : Sym → SymClass
  | .op => .call
  | .cl => .ret
  | .dat => .internal

/-- **`heightDelta`** — the per-symbol stack-height change, a function of the symbol's CLASS: a call
adds one to the stack height, a return removes one, an internal leaves it unchanged. THIS is what makes
the stack height a function of the input word alone (`run_height`). -/

/-- **`Vpa`** — a visibly-pushdown automaton (Alur–Madhusudan), faithful: the `call` transition pushes a
stack symbol `γ` of the transition's choosing; the `ret` transition READS and pops the top stack symbol
`γ`; the `int` transition never touches the stack. The stack ACTION is fixed by the symbol class; only
the control target (and, for returns, the read of the popped symbol) is the automaton's. -/

  int : State → Sym → State → Prop

variable {State Gamma : Type u}

/-- **`stepValid M s`** — the visibly-pushdown discipline for one step, dispatched on the symbol's CLASS
(NOT its state): a CALL pushes exactly one symbol (`post.stack = γ :: pre.stack`); a RETURN pops exactly
one (`pre.stack = γ :: rest`, `post.stack = rest`); an INTERNAL leaves the stack (`post.stack =
pre.stack`). This is the entire content of "visibly pushdown": the stack shape is class-driven, so it is
enforced regardless of how permissive the underlying transition relations are. -/

  | .internal => M.int s.pre.state s.sym s.post.state ∧ s.post.stack = s.pre.stack

/-- **`R_vpa`** — the visibly-pushdown chaining relation over configs-carrying steps: `a` reduces to `b`
iff `b` begins where `a` ended (`b.pre = a.post`). Exactly the `delta`-shape `DfaAsCert` uses (regular
control), but the config it threads carries a STACK whose push/pop is class-driven (per-step `stepValid`).
The visibly-pushdown rung is `Hypergraph.Cert R_vpa` + the `stepValid` wrapper. -/
def R_vpa (a b : VStep State Gamma) : Prop := b.pre = a.post

structural recursion to `Hypergraph.chain R_vpa` (proved in `vchained_iff_chain`). -/

starts in `q₀` with EMPTY stack, ends in an `accept` state with EMPTY stack (well-matched), and whose
every step obeys the class-driven `stepValid` discipline. The empty-stack boundaries encode "every call
matched by a return" — the nested-word acceptance condition. -/

the same structural recursion on the run (`[]`/`[_]` are `True`; `a :: b :: rest` conjoins the head
relation `R_vpa a b` with the recursive tail). So a VPA chain and a `Hypergraph` reduction chain over
`R_vpa` are the same predicate — exactly as `DfaAsCert.chained_iff_chain` shows for the regular rung. -/

`first`/`last` such that the run is a genuine `Hypergraph.Cert R_vpa first last run` TOGETHER WITH the VPA
acceptance wrapper (initial `q₀` + empty stack, accepting state + empty stack, per-step `stepValid`). The
`Cert` conjunct is bit-for-bit the SAME certificate object `Crypto/Hypergraph` uses for CFG / hypergraph /
DFA reductions — only the relation is visibly-pushdown-specific (`R_vpa`). Proof: reassociate the
conjuncts and swap `vchained` for `Hypergraph.chain R_vpa` via `vchained_iff_chain`. -/

`heightDelta` of the symbol read — `+1` on a call, `-1` on a return, `0` on an internal. This holds
BECAUSE the stack action is class-driven (`stepValid`), independent of the control state. -/

`run_height` / `stack_height_input_determined` are the ROOT property. The follow-on they enable, stated
precisely so it is a named seam and not a hole:

    For the FINITE-alphabet visibly-nested fragment (this file's `Sym` grid), template equivalence and
    inclusion — "do VPAs `M₁`, `M₂` accept the same nested-word language?", "is L(M₁) ⊆ L(M₂)?" — are
    DECIDABLE (EXPTIME-complete, Alur–Madhusudan), because input-determined stack height gives boolean
    closure (union / intersection / COMPLEMENT) + determinization, and determinized VPAs have decidable
    emptiness. The general-CFG rung (`g.Produces` for arbitrary `g`) PROVABLY cannot have this: CFL
    equivalence is undecidable.

That is the one genuinely new capability the rung opens (assessment §3). It is NOT proved in this lane —
it needs the determinization construction and the emptiness decision procedure — and it is NOT sorry'd.
It is the precisely-stated frontier this rung's root property unlocks.
