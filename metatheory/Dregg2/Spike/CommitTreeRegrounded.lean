# `Dregg2.Spike.CommitTreeRegrounded` — the `CommitTreeInjective` consumers RE-GROUNDED off the
FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floor onto a REAL collision game carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `CommitTreeInjective` site)

`EffectVmConstraints2.CommitTreeInjective H := ∀ a b : List ℤ, commitTree H a = commitTree H b → a = b`
is stated as **injectivity** of the four-leaf state-commitment hash tree (air.rs:2540–2543). `List ℤ` is
INFINITE and `commitTree H` lands in a BOUNDED range — a BabyBear felt, `0 ≤ · < 2³¹ − 2²⁷ + 1`, which
is what the carrier's own module header says the tree computes (`H : List ℤ → ℤ`, the Poseidon2
`hash_4_to_1` black box) — so the floor is **FALSE at deployed parameters by pigeonhole** (§1,
`commitTreeInjective_false_of_finite_range` / `commitTreeInjective_false_babyBear`). Both consumers
conditioned on it — `state_commitment_binds_state` and `state_commitment_no_silent_change` — are
therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE** at real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proofs are clean; the
HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

The carrier's docstring calls it "an honest carried Prop (PORTAL-OK)… a direct consequence of Poseidon2
collision-resistance". It is not a consequence of collision-resistance: collision-resistance says
collisions are hard to FIND, never that they do not EXIST, and §1 proves they exist at the deployed
felt. A carried assumption is honest only when something can satisfy it.

## The re-grounding (the `PreRotationKeySetRegrounded` / `Poseidon2KeyedBridge` pattern)

  * **§1 — FALSE AS NAMED.** The counting core (`HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range`) fires
    on `CommitTreeInjective` directly; `commitTreeInjective_false_babyBear` is the deployed form. No
    Poseidon2 collision is exhibited — cardinality suffices, and is the honest statement.
  * **§2 — the KEYED family.** `CommitDeployment` bundles the deployed hash with its domain-separation
    tag space (the effective key — the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model). `commitFamily` lifts it to a
    `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`; `deployed_hash_is_family_instance` and
    `collisionGame_wins_iff` pin FAITHFULNESS — the game is about the tree the AIR actually computes.
  * **§3 — the STATE-EQUIVOCATION GAME.** The attack `state_commitment_binds_state` rules out is a
    first-class λ-indexed game: handed a sampled tag, the adversary outputs TWO post-state tuples and a
    published root, and WINS iff the tuples are DISTINCT yet BOTH satisfy the real `StateCommitSat`
    against that ONE published `NEW_COMMIT`. Two different states behind one published PI — the exact
    compromise, IN the win relation rather than in a docstring.
  * **§4 — THE REDUCTION.** `equivocationToCollisionFinder` hands the two exhibited tuples to the
    collision game; `equivocation_wins_imp` proves win-preservation (both tuples' trees equal the ONE
    published root, so the tuples themselves collide) and `equivocation_adv_le` is the advantage
    inequality by `winProb_le_of_imp`. The reduction is the ONLY bridge between hypothesis and
    conclusion — §6's canary compiles that fact.
  * **§5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.** `state_commitment_binds_state_advantage_bound` and
    `state_commitment_no_silent_change_advantage_bound`: the Boolean "two traces pinned to the same
    `NEW_COMMIT` commit to the SAME tuple" becomes "the SAME tuple EXCEPT with negligible probability",
    from the collision floor VIA the reduction.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETER IS THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND IT IS UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the
UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, so it is FALSE wherever collisions
exist — and §1 proves they exist at the deployed tree. §7 instantiates both poles at THIS carrier:
`commit_floor_top_false_of_compressing` (`Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at deployed parameters, routed through the
counting core) and `commit_floor_bot_vacuous` (`Eff := ⊥` is vacuous). So `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the
open, at every use site: this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow
imitation would be another costume. Hiding the `Eff` dependence is the disease; naming it is the repair.

## Non-fake

The floor is REFUTABLE (`brokenCommit_floor_top_false`: a hash that ignores its input has a finder
winning at every tag, advantage `1`) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary: the keystone does
NOT follow from the floor applied at some OTHER finder). The OLD `CommitTreeInjective` consumers are
KEPT untouched in `EffectVmConstraints2`; siblings ADDED here. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh
`axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the `STATE_COMMIT` / EffectVm-AIR lane. The FRI/Merkle `compress` carrier is the same shape and
is re-grounded in `Circuit.FriCompressRegrounded`; the pre-rotation key-set carrier is
`Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`.

`CommitTreeInjective H` IS `Function.Injective (commitTree H)` on the INFINITE `List ℤ`. The deployed

`0`, and `0` is in the window. So a BabyBear-valued `hash_4_to_1` gives a BabyBear-valued root. -/

The floor is not merely un-proven at the deployed hash; it is provably FALSE there, so

genuine collision — two DISTINCT committed tuples with equal roots. This is the counting core in the

/-! ## §2 — the KEYED family: domain separation is the key.

The deployed `hash_4_to_1` is a FIXED unkeyed function; its effective key is the domain-separation tag
the circuit's hash regime absorbs. Modelling that tag as the key is the standard keyed-from-unkeyed
treatment and is what stops the "hardcode a known collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed
floor. -/

/-- **The deployed state-commitment scheme.** `hash` is the tag-keyed Poseidon2 `hash_4_to_1` (the
deployed fixed black box at each domain-separation tag); `Tag` is the finite, inhabited tag space the CR
game samples; `deployedTag` is the tag the EffectVm AIR computes under. -/

`KeyedHashFamily`, keyed by its domain-separation tag. This is the object
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` is realized at for the real state commitment: the AIR's group-4
constraint pins `STATE_COMMIT` to `commitTree`, so `commitTree` is what must bind. -/

/-- **FAITHFULNESS.** The deployed FIXED tree IS the keyed family's instance at the deployed tag — a

/-- **THE OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE.** If the injective `CommitTreeInjective` held at every tag it
would discharge `CollisionResistant (commitFamily D)` (no collisions ⟹ every finder's advantage `0`). So
the OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE at the
deployed tree (§1), it was an EMPTY hypothesis. Nothing is lost re-grounding; a false hypothesis is
replaced by one a real hash can satisfy. -/

outputs two committed tuples and WINS iff they are a GENUINE collision of the deployed tree at that tag
— distinct tuples, equal roots. This is the game the floor below quantifies over, with an explicit
adversary class. -/

`StateEquivocation`; it WINS iff the two post-state tuples are DISTINCT yet BOTH satisfy the real
group-4 transition constraint (`EffectVmConstraints2.StateCommitSat`, the deployed
`commit = commitTree H st`) against the SAME published `NEW_COMMIT`. Winning this game IS the attack
`state_commitment_binds_state` rules out: two different post-states standing behind one published PI.

/-! ## §4 — THE REDUCTION: a `STATE_COMMIT` equivocator IS a commitment-tree collision finder. -/

/-- **THE REDUCTION, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** An equivocator becomes a collision finder by handing
over the two post-state tuples it exhibited. This is not a rename and not a re-indexing: it is the
group-4 constraint read as an extractor — the constraint admits only when the published root IS the
tuple's tree, so an equivocation against one published root hands the pair over directly. -/

    (A : Adversary (stateEquivocationGame D)) : Adversary (commitCollisionGame D) where
  run := fun n t => ((A.run n t).st, (A.run n t).st')

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — and this IS `state_commitment_binds_state`, at the game level.** Wherever the
equivocator wins, the extracted pair is a GENUINE collision of the deployed tree: both satisfying traces
pin the SAME published `NEW_COMMIT` to their own tuple's tree, so the two trees are equal, while winning
forces the tuples distinct. The crypto content lives in a proof term, not in a sentence about one — and
it is the OLD consumer's proof, with the injectivity step DELETED rather than assumed. -/

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY.** The equivocator's advantage is at most the extracted collision
finder's, at every parameter — both play over the SAME sampled tag space, and every tag the equivocator
wins the extracted finder wins. A genuine reduction inequality over real game advantages. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.

The Boolean keystones become advantage bounds, derived FROM the collision floor VIA the reduction. The
old statements are kept in `EffectVmConstraints2`; these are their honest siblings. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `EffectVmConstraints2.state_commitment_binds_state`.**

Under the commitment-collision floor at the game the reduction actually attacks, a `STATE_COMMIT`
equivocator whose extracted finder is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: a prover
exhibits two different post-states behind one published `NEW_COMMIT` only with negligible probability.
The Boolean "two traces pinned to the same PI MUST commit to the same tuple" becomes "commit to the same
tuple EXCEPT with negligible probability" — which is what a real Poseidon2 can actually deliver, and
what the FALSE injective floor was standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the
equivocation game, the hypothesis about the collision game, and `equivocation_adv_le` is the only bridge
(§6's canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **`hEff` IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard "the reduction is efficient"
side condition, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The floor's honesty
is exactly its `Eff`'s, and §7 prices both poles: `⊤` makes it FALSE at the deployed tree, `⊥`
vacuous. -/

committed tuple changes the published root EXCEPT with negligible probability: an adversary exhibiting a
SILENT change — two distinct tuples whose group-4 rows carry one and the same root — is, by the same
extractor, a collision finder, since the shared root it publishes is exactly the `newCommit` both its
tuples are pinned to. Under the collision floor at the extracted finder its advantage is negligible.

reduction — try to conclude the equivocator's negligibility from the collision floor applied at some
OTHER finder `B`, NOT the one extracted from it — and the proof does not go through: the floor bounds
`B`, and only `equivocation_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED finder to the equivocation game. Under the
OLD free hypothesis (`hCR : CommitTreeInjective H`, hypothesis and conclusion sharing the same free `H`)
this tooth was unwritable. It compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

The sweep's deep result (`FloorGames` §2) says a game floor at the unrestricted class IS the existence
floor. Here is that theorem instantiated at the deployed commitment tree, so a reader can price any
`Eff` exactly rather than take the residual on faith. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` for the DEPLOYED tree.)** The real content, and the
reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded commitment tree HAS a collision at every tag (§1's
counting core), so the collision game is always solvable, so the floor at the unrestricted adversary
class is FALSE — and every consumer would be vacuous there. `Classical.choice` is the adversary and no
restatement of the win relation can see it coming. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem
instead of a promise. -/

for ANY deployment, including a completely broken hash. Recorded HONESTLY: a satisfiability witness is
worth nothing without the refutation beside it, and these two poles together are what make `Eff` a dial

tree is injective discharges `CollisionResistant (commitFamily D)` — the honest floor is REALIZABLE,
unlike the injective `CommitTreeInjective` at deployed parameters. ⚑ Recorded with its price: this is
the `⊤`-class object, which §7's first tooth proves FALSE at a range-bounded (i.e. real) tree. An
