# Dregg2.Apps.PrivacyVotingGated — a PRIVATE VOTE as a VERIFIED USERSPACE APP on the ONE gated executor.

A private ballot: each ENFRANCHISED voter casts EXACTLY ONE vote, gated by a credential, with the vote
recorded as a NULLIFIER (the vote-as-nullifier anti-replay discipline — a voter's ballot nullifier slot,
once written, can never be silently re-cast). This is the executed, credential-gated dual of two
already-proved keystones:

  * `Dregg2.Apps.MultisigVote` already runs vote-as-nullifier on the REAL kernel: a cast vote inserts
    the voter's id into the kernel's spent-note seen-set, so a double-vote is rejected by the SAME
    fail-closed gate that stops a double-spend (`note_no_double_spend` / `note_spend_inserts`). That is
    the seen-SET discipline. THIS module re-models the SAME anti-replay through the ONE production turn
    entry `Dregg2.Exec.FullForestAuth.execFullForestG` (the `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` 4-leg gate:
    credential ∧ cap-authority ∧ caveats-discharged ∧ NOT-revoked), recording the vote-nullifier as a
    `WriteOnce` SLOT on the ballot cell — so no-double-vote is enforced BY THE EXECUTOR's caveat gate,
    on the EXECUTED turn the running system runs, not merely by a model-level set.
  * `Dregg2.Exec.PrivacyTheorems` proves the nullifier NO-DOUBLE-SPEND anti-replay (the Zcash
    discipline: a nullifier already in the spent set fail-closes, and a spent nullifier never leaves
    the set — `nullifier_set_monotone` / `seq_no_respend`). A cast-vote IS a nullifier-spend: the
    ballot's per-voter nullifier slot is the on-chain "spent" mark, and the `WriteOnce` caveat is the
    set-membership gate (`old = 0` ⇒ fresh ⇒ admitted; `old ≠ 0 ∧ new ≠ old` ⇒ already-voted ⇒ rejected).

## The vote as a credential-gated op through `execFullForestG`

A cast-vote is a single `SetField` on the ballot cell writing the voter's NULLIFIER mark, modelled as a
GATED leaf node `⟨ mkAuth cred [], .setFieldA actor ballotCell voterNullSlot mark, [] ⟩` run through the
4-leg gate. `mkAuth cred []` supplies an admitting cap-mode (`.unchecked (Guard.all [])`), an empty
within-cell caveat list (so the GATE's caveat leg is vacuously discharged — the SLOT caveats are
enforced separately by `stateStepGuarded` inside `execFullA`), no chain, and (by default) nullifier `0`.

## The ballot cell's SLOT CAVEATS (the executor-enforced ballot invariants)

The ballot cell carries (`s.kernel.slotCaveats ballotCell`):
  * `WriteOnce voterNull A` — voter A's ballot nullifier slot: once A has voted (slot ≠ 0), it can NEVER
    be silently re-cast → **NO DOUBLE-VOTE** (vote-as-nullifier anti-replay, the executed dual of the
    `PrivacyTheorems` nullifier no-double-spend);
  * `WriteOnce voterNull B` — voter B's ballot nullifier slot, identically.

`stateStepGuarded` reads exactly these on EVERY `SetField` to the ballot cell and FAILS CLOSED on a
re-cast — so no-double-vote is enforced BY THE EXECUTOR, not merely carried.

## End-user theorems (general; concrete `#guard` witnesses for non-vacuity)

  1. `pv_forged_credential_rejected` — a FORGED voter credential ⇒ the whole gated turn rejects (`none`),
     ∀ state — nobody can vote without a genuine credential.
  2. `pv_revoked_voter_rejected`     — a REVOKED voter credential (its nullifier in `s.kernel.revoked`)
     ⇒ rejected, ∀ state (via `gateOK_revoked_fails`) — a disenfranchised/revoked voter can never vote
     again (even with a perfectly valid signature: validity and revocation are orthogonal legs).
  3. `pv_no_double_vote`             — a SECOND cast over an already-recorded vote-nullifier slot is
     rejected by the executor's `WriteOnce` caveat (`caveatsAdmit = false`), EVEN with a genuine,
     non-revoked credential — vote-as-nullifier anti-replay, the executed dual of the `PrivacyTheorems`
     nullifier no-double-spend discipline.
  4. `pv_cast_conserves`            — a committed cast-vote moves NO asset's supply (per-asset Δ = 0):
     the ballot write touches metadata, never balance.

Plus a parallel **TOKEN + MACAROON-CHAIN** voter arm (§2b/§5b): `.token` credentials for the WHO leg
and `NodeAuth.chain := some …` for the macaroon `verifiedChainGate` caveat leg — with
`pv_token_forged_rejected`, `pv_chain_forged_rejected`, `pv_chain_caveat_violation_rejected`, and
`pv_token_good_commits` witnessed on `ballot0` alongside the signature arm.

Plus a concrete ballot-cell state (`ballot0`) whose `#guard`s show a GOOD first cast COMMITS, a forged
credential gives `none`, a revoked voter gives `none`, and a double-vote gives `none` — every theorem
witnessed REAL, not vacuous.

Does NOT touch `MultisigVote.lean`, `PrivacyTheorems.lean`,
`FullForestAuth.lean`, nor `Dregg2.lean`. Reuses ONLY the proved gated-executor keystones
(`gateOK_revoked_fails`, `execFullForestG_unauthorized_fails`, `execFullForestG_conserves_per_asset`)
and the proved `stateStepGuarded` fail-closed caveat teeth.

/-! ## §1 — The private-vote DOMAIN at the Demo carriers (the ballot cell, the per-voter nullifier slots).

The ballot cell holds, per enfranchised voter, ONE `WriteOnce` nullifier slot. A cast vote writes the
voter's nullifier mark to their slot; `WriteOnce` then permits the FIRST cast (`old = 0`, fresh — not
yet voted) and forbids any later re-cast (`old ≠ 0`, already voted) — the vote-as-nullifier anti-replay.
The slot's freshness/spent state IS the on-chain nullifier set, exactly as in `PrivacyTheorems`. -/

/-- The ballot cell holding the per-voter nullifier marks (the tally cell). Cell `0` so the actor can be
`0` too — `stateAuthB` is then trivially satisfied (`actor == src`), letting the credential gate and the
SLOT CAVEAT be the load-bearing admission conditions (not the cap-list). -/
abbrev ballotCell : CellId := 0

/-- The voting actor (the credential holder submitting the ballot). Equal to `ballotCell` so `stateAuthB`
holds by `actor == src` — the app's authority story rides on the §4 CREDENTIAL gate, not the c-list. -/
abbrev ballotActor : CellId := 0

re-cast). The executed dual of A's spent-note nullifier mark in `PrivacyTheorems`. -/
abbrev voterNullA : FieldName := "null_A"
/-- Voter B's ballot NULLIFIER slot — `WriteOnce`: once B has voted it is permanent (no double-vote). -/
abbrev voterNullB : FieldName := "null_B"

/-- The ballot cell's factory-installed SLOT CAVEATS: each enfranchised voter's nullifier slot is
`WriteOnce`. The executor reads these on EVERY cast (`stateStepGuarded`), so a re-cast fail-closes — the
no-double-vote teeth. (Two voters here; the pattern is uniform per voter.) -/
def ballotCaveats : List SlotCaveat :=
  [ .writeOnce voterNullA, .writeOnce voterNullB ]

/-! ## §2 — A cast-vote as a GATED LEAF NODE through the production turn entry `execFullForestG`.

A cast-vote is a single `SetField` on the ballot cell — writing the voter's NULLIFIER mark to their slot —
decorated with a credential (the WHO) and run through the 4-leg gate. `mkAuth cred []` supplies an
admitting cap-mode, an empty within-cell caveat list (the GATE's caveat leg is vacuously discharged — the
SLOT caveat is enforced separately by `stateStepGuarded`), and no chain. So `gateOK` reduces to the
credential leg ∧ the revocation leg. -/

/-- A gated cast-vote node: credential `cred`, a `SetField voterSlot mark` on the ballot cell (recording
the voter's nullifier), no children. The production-entry shape `⟨ mkAuth cred [], action, [] ⟩`. -/

  ⟨ mkAuth cred [], .setFieldA ballotActor ballotCell voterSlot mark, [] ⟩

/-- A gated cast-vote node whose credential carries a specific revocation NULLIFIER `nul` (for the
revocation theorem — the wire-supplied `credNul` the gate checks against `s.kernel.revoked`). Otherwise
identical to `castNode`. -/

/-! ## §2b — The TOKEN + MACAROON-CHAIN voter arm (parallel to the `.signature` credential arm).

The signature arm supplies the WHO via `portalVerify (.signature stmt sig)`. The token arm supplies
the WHO via `portalVerify (.token key sig)` (the HMAC macaroon tag) AND the macaroon caveat leg via
`NodeAuth.chain := some …` — `chainGateG` requires `verifiedChainGate` = HMAC replay-and-compare ∧
caveat meet. Empty within-cell `caveats` (as in `mkAuth`); the chain IS the attenuation gate. -/

which every cast-vote's `none`/`some` is read off `execFullAGated` directly. -/

/-! ## §4 — The CREDENTIAL gate: a FORGED credential fails-closed (state-independent).

`gateOK (mkAuth cred []) s = credentialValidG (mkAuth cred []) && capAuthorityG (mkAuth cred []) &&
caveatsDischarged (mkAuth cred []) s && revocationGate (mkAuth cred []) s`. For `mkAuth`: the cap mode is
`.unchecked (Guard.all [])` (admits), the within-cell caveat list is `[]` (vacuously discharged, no
chain), the nullifier is `0` (not in an empty revocation registry). So `gateOK` is exactly the credential
leg `credentialValidG (mkAuth cred [])` — `portalVerify cred`. -/

/-- **`gateOK_forged_false`.** The forged credential's gate leg is FALSE

`execFullForestG s (castNode goodCred …) = stateStepGuarded …`; then the `WriteOnce` caveat on the
voter's nullifier slot makes `caveatsAdmit = false` (the slot is already non-zero — the voter has voted),

A cast-vote is a single `SetField`, which has `ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for EVERY asset — so its per-asset

commits nothing — voting touches the tally, never balances. -/

/-! ## §9 — NON-VACUITY: concrete ballot states with the real WriteOnce slot caveats + `#guard` witnesses.

`ballot0` is the ballot cell `0`, born with the two `WriteOnce` per-voter nullifier caveats, with voter A
having ALREADY VOTED (`null_A = 7`, a recorded nullifier) and voter B FRESH (`null_B = 0`, not yet voted).
Actor `0 == ballotCell`, so `stateAuthB` holds; the cell is Live (default lifecycle `0`); accounts `{0,1}`;
the revocation registry is empty. On `ballot0` we exhibit: (i) B's FIRST cast COMMITS; (ii) a forged
credential ⇒ `none`; (iii) a REVOKED voter ⇒ `none`; (iv) A's SECOND (different) cast ⇒ `none` (the
WriteOnce nullifier slot bites — no double-vote); (v) the committed cast CONSERVES both assets. -/

/-- A ballot-cell pre-state: cell `0` carries the two `WriteOnce` per-voter nullifier caveats; voter A has
ALREADY VOTED (`null_A = 7`, a recorded nullifier — re-cast must fail), voter B is FRESH (`null_B = 0`,
not yet voted — first cast must commit). -/
