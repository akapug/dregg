# `Dregg2.Apps.QueueRootFloorRegrounded` — the `RootCR` / `LeafCR` / `PairCR` / `LenBindCR`
consumers RE-GROUNDED off the FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floors onto REAL collision games carrying
explicit `Eff`s.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `Apps/QueueRoot` cluster — 4 carriers)

All four queue-root carriers are stated as **injectivity**:

  * `RootCR root := ∀ ls₁ ls₂, ZeroFree ls₁ → ZeroFree ls₂ → root ls₁ = root ls₂ → ls₁ = ls₂`
  * `LeafCR leafHash := ∀ a b, leafHash a = leafHash b → a = b`
  * `PairCR combine := ∀ a b a' b', combine a b = combine a' b' → a = a' ∧ b = b'`
  * `LenBindCR bindLen := ∀ n x m y, bindLen n x = bindLen m y → n = m ∧ x = y`

The deployed scheme is `blake3_binary_root` over `hash_entry` (`storage/src/commitment.rs`,
`storage/src/queue.rs`): every one of these maps a domain into a BOUNDED 256-bit digest, so each is
**FALSE at deployed parameters by pigeonhole** (§1). Every consumer conditioned on them —
`dequeue_proof_pins`, `dequeue_forgery_refused`, `stale_proof_refused`, `dequeue_proof_unique`,
`queueDequeueProven_pins_root_transition`, `queueDequeueProven_refuses_forgery`,
`queueDequeueProven_refuses_stale`, `tagged_dequeue_proof_pins` — is therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE** at
real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proofs are clean; the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

## ⚑ THE ZERO-FREE RESTRICTION IS RESPECTED, NOT DODGED — this is the delicate part

`RootCR` does NOT claim full injectivity. `QueueRoot` itself proves full injectivity FALSE for the
padded scheme (`refRoot_pad_alias` / `padded_root_not_fully_injective`: `root [1,2,3] = root [1,2,3,0]`
— padding is indistinguishable from a zero leaf), which is exactly WHY the carrier is restricted to
ZERO-FREE lists. A false-proof that merely re-exhibited the padding alias would prove nothing new and
would miss the carrier.

So §1 refutes `RootCR` **on its own restricted domain**: `zfRep n := List.replicate (n+1) 1` is an
INFINITE family of pairwise-distinct ZERO-FREE lists (`zfRep_zeroFree`, `zfRep_injective`), so a
range-bounded root collides on two of THEM (`exists_zeroFree_collision_of_finite_range`). The
restriction buys nothing against counting: the zero-free lists are still infinite, the digest is still
bounded. `rootCR_false_blake3` is the deployed form.

## The re-grounding (the `HermineHashCRRegrounded` concurrent-forgery pattern)

The deployed dequeue path rests on TWO carriers at once, and a forger breaks EITHER — so this is a
genuine **DICHOTOMY with a union bound**, exactly like `HermineHashCRRegrounded`'s concurrent-forgery
keystone, not a single-leaf bound:

  * **§3 `dequeueForgeryGame`** — a first-class λ-indexed game: the adversary is handed a sampled
    instance (the tag, the live pending window `head :: rest`) and WINS iff it produces a proof that
    VERIFIES against the live root yet claims a DIFFERENT entry or remaining list. The forgery is IN
    the win relation, read off the REAL `verifyDequeue` (which mirrors `verify_dequeue_proof`
    verbatim) — nothing here is a docstring.
  * **§4 the two extractors + the dichotomy.** `forgeryToRootFinder` hands over the two committed
    windows; `forgeryToLeafFinder` hands over the two entries. `forgery_wins_imp` proves the real
    dichotomy: wherever the forger wins, EITHER the two windows are DISTINCT zero-free lists with one
    root (a genuine ROOT collision) OR they are equal, forcing `remaining = rest`, so the claim
    differs in the ENTRY while the leaves collide (a genuine LEAF collision). `forgery_adv_le` is the
    UNION BOUND over the shared sampled-instance space.
  * **§5** — `dequeue_proof_pins_advantage_bound` &c: the Boolean "an admitted proof PINS the
    transition" / "a forged claim is REFUSED" become "EXCEPT with negligible probability", from the
    two collision floors VIA the reduction.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETERS ARE THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND THEY ARE UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the
UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, hence FALSE wherever collisions
exist — and §1 proves they exist at the deployed root AND at the deployed leaf hash. §7 prices both
poles at THESE carriers. `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the open, at every use site: this tree has no cost
model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow imitation would be another costume.

## Scope — HONEST

FULLY re-grounded: the DEPLOYED dequeue path (`RootCR` + `LeafCR`), via the dichotomy reduction.
FALSE-PROVED but NOT game-re-grounded: `PairCR` / `LenBindCR` (§8), the carriers of the PROPOSED §7
level-tagged hardening (`taggedRoot_injective`) — which Rust has NOT adopted (a wire-affecting root
format change, per `QueueRoot`'s own ⚠). Their repair path is stated in §8 and is mechanical: the same
`Deployment` + collision-game + extractor shape as §2-§5, at `tRoot`/`bindLen`. Re-grounding a
hardening that is not deployed is lower value than refuting it honestly, which §8 does.

## Non-fake

Both floors are REFUTABLE on broken deployments (§7) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary:
the keystones do NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries). The OLD consumers are KEPT
untouched and doc-marked at the teeth; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh
`axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the QUEUE-ROOT lane. `KeySetCR` is `Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`; `RosterCR` is
`Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded`; the STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are
`Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers` / `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge`; the commit-reveal side is
`Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded` (whose `winProb_le_add_of_imp` union bound this file reuses rather
than duplicating).

and the honest refutation is pigeonhole on cardinalities, exactly the shape of
`HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`. Being precise about which teeth fire on which carrier
is part of the repair. -/

/-! ## §2 — the DEPLOYED QUEUE DEPLOYMENT: domain separation is the key.

The deployed root and leaf hash are FIXED unkeyed functions; their effective key is the
domain-separation tag (`TAG_QUEUE_ENTRY`, the derive-key prefix the leaf hash already uses) — the
standard keyed-from-unkeyed model (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1-§2), and what stops the "hardcode a known
collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed floor. -/

/-- **The deployed queue-root commitment scheme.** `root` / `leafHash` are the tag-keyed deployed
functions; `head` and `restEntries` are the LIVE pending window at the sampled instance (the head
entry and the entries behind it); `leafNonzero` is the `QueueRoot.LeafNonzero` carrier — BLAKE3
preimage resistance, which is NOT an injectivity floor and is NOT refuted by §1. -/

the claim must differ in the ENTRY while the two leaves collide — a genuine LEAF collision.

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `QueueRoot.dequeue_proof_pins` / `dequeue_forgery_refused` — from ROOT collision
resistance AND LEAF collision resistance, VIA the reduction.**

Under the root-collision floor at the game the reduction attacks AND the leaf-collision floor at the
entry hash, a dequeue forger whose extracted finders are in the floors' adversary classes has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an admitted proof PINS the head-dequeue transition EXCEPT with negligible
probability, and a forged claim is REFUSED EXCEPT with negligible probability. The Boolean pins become
the additive negligible advantage — which is what a real BLAKE3 can actually deliver, and what the
FALSE injective floors were standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about
the forgery game, the hypotheses about the two collision games, and `forgery_adv_le` is the only
bridge (§6's canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **THE `hEffR`/`hEffL` OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard
"the reduction is efficient" side conditions, PARAMETERS because this tree has no cost model
(`FloorGames` §8). Both floors are priced exactly by §7: `⊤` makes them FALSE at the deployed BLAKE3,
`⊥` vacuous. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `QueueRoot.queueDequeueProven_pins_root_transition` / `_refuses_forgery`.** The
WELD keystone's advantage-bounded sibling: a proven dequeue's committed root pair IS the modeled root
transition EXCEPT with negligible probability. The guarded verb (`queueDequeueProven`) checks exactly
`verifyDequeueAgainst` against the live `message_root`, whose structural leg is the `verifyDequeue` the
forgery game already carries and whose live-root leg is the game's `p.oldRoot = …` conjunct — so a
forger against the WELD is a forger against `dequeueForgeryGame`, and this bound is that one. -/

/-! ## §6 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystones go RED. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries.)** Strip
the reduction — try to conclude the forger's negligibility from the two floors applied at some OTHER
root finder `B` and leaf finder `E`, NOT the ones extracted from the forger — and the proof does not
go through: the floors bound `B` and `E`, and only `forgery_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED pair to the
forgery game. Under the OLD free hypotheses (`hRC : RootCR root`, `hLC : LeafCR leafHash`, with
hypothesis and conclusion sharing the same free `root`/`leafHash`) this tooth was unwritable. It
compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

the reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded root HAS a ZERO-FREE collision at every tag (§1a's
counting core, inside the carrier's own restricted domain), so the root-collision game is always
solvable and the floor at the unrestricted class is FALSE — every consumer would be vacuous there.
`Classical.choice` is the adversary and no restatement of the win relation can see it coming. This is
the price of `hEffR`, stated as a theorem instead of a promise. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the LEAF floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` for a COMPRESSING entry hash.)** The deployed

unrestricted-class leaf floor is FALSE. The price of `hEffL`. -/

/-! ## §8 — `PairCR` / `LenBindCR`: FALSE-PROVED (the §7 hardening's carriers).

These two carry the PROPOSED level-tagged hardening (`QueueRoot` §7, `taggedRoot_injective`), which
Rust has NOT adopted — switching `blake3_binary_root` to the tagged scheme changes every queue
`message_root` on the wire, so it needs a coordinated root-format migration (`QueueRoot`'s own ⚠).
They are refuted here as named; game-re-grounding a hardening that is not deployed is lower value than
refuting it honestly, and the repair path is mechanical: the same `Deployment`/collision-game/extractor
shape as §2-§5, instantiated at `tRoot`/`bindLen`, with `taggedRoot_injective`'s length-then-shape peel
as the win-preserving map. -/

/-- **TOOTH — `PairCR` is FALSE for a range-bounded node hash.** The 2-to-1 node combine
`blake3(0x01 ‖ l ‖ r)` compresses the INFINITE `Int × Int` into a bounded digest, so it cannot be
pairwise injective. Mirrors `HashFloorHonesty.compressInjective_false_of_finite_range`. -/

/-- **⚑ THE HARDENING DOES NOT ESCAPE THE FINDING.** `QueueRoot.taggedRoot_RootCR` discharges `RootCR`
from `Function.Injective tagLeaf` + `PairCR` + `LenBindCR` — so if the hardened scheme's carriers held,
`RootCR` would hold. But §1a proves `RootCR` FALSE for any range-bounded root, and the tagged root IS
range-bounded at a real BLAKE3. Contrapositive: at the deployed digest the hardening's carrier
conjunction is itself FALSE. The upgrade fixes the PADDING ALIAS (a structural bug, and it really does
fix it — `tagged_kills_pad_alias`); it does NOT and cannot fix the counting bug. Only the `Eff`
parameter does. -/
