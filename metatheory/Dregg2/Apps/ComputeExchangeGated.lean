# Dregg2.Apps.ComputeExchangeGated — a VALUE-MOVING compute market as a VERIFIED USERSPACE APP,
RE-POINTED onto the REAL escrow FACTORY (F1b: the kernel escrow verbs are GONE).

A compute exchange is the canonical pay-for-work escrow workflow: a BUYER locks the job payment, the
PROVIDER receives it on delivery, or the buyer gets it back on failure. This app is RE-POINTED off the
off-ledger escrow VERB family (`createEscrowA`/`releaseEscrowA`/`refundEscrowA` over the deleted
`escrows` side-table) onto the FACTORY-BORN escrow CELL: the locked payment is held in the escrow
cell's OWN per-asset `bal` column, the lifecycle lives in a SLOT governed by the factory's installed
state machine `admitTable [(open,released),(open,refunded)]`, and conservation is the ORDINARY
per-asset move law — NO side-table. (`Dregg2.Apps.EscrowFactory` is the factory; this app
instantiates it, exactly as `Apps/BountyBoardGated.lean` does for the bounty shape.)

## The ops (re-pointed)

  * **order**  — mint a factory escrow cell (`createCellFromFactoryA` ⇒ `EscrowFactory.mintEscrowCell`)
    carrying the deal terms + state machine, then FUND it with an ordinary move of the payment into the
    cell's `bal` column (`EscrowFactory.depositEscrow`). Conservation-neutral mint + conserving move.
  * **settle** — RELEASE the held payment to the provider (`EscrowFactory.releaseEscrow`): the
    OPEN→RELEASED transition + move `bal` out, gated on the delivery-condition witness.
  * **refund** — REFUND the held payment to the buyer (`EscrowFactory.refundEscrow`): OPEN→REFUNDED.

## The gate teeth (preserved) + the settle-safety contract (re-proved on the factory shape)

  1. `cx_forged_rejected`               — a FORGED credential on ANY gated op ⇒ `none`, ∀ s;
  2. `cx_revoked_rejected`              — a credential whose nullifier is in `s.kernel.revoked` ⇒ `none`;
  3. `cx_order_mint_conserves`          — minting the factory escrow cell is conservation-neutral;
  4. `cx_order_fund_conserves`          — funding it (the payment move) conserves every asset;
  5. `cx_settle_conserves`              — a committed settle (release) conserves every asset;
  6. `cx_refund_conserves`              — a committed refund conserves every asset;
  7. `cx_no_double_resolve`             — once settled, neither a second settle nor a refund commits;
  8. `cx_settle_requires_condition`     — a settle with a wrong delivery witness is rejected;
  9. `cx_settle_requires_live_provider` — D3: a settle into a non-account provider is rejected;
 10. `cx_refund_requires_live_buyer`    — D3: a refund into a non-account buyer is rejected;
 11. `cx_open_settleable`/`cx_open_refundable` — value-not-stranded: a funded OPEN job resolves.

## App-level semantics (Hatchery bridge — §8b, PRESERVED across the re-point)

  * `cx_pay_conserved_forever` — payment supply never drifts on `trajG` (Tier-4 `conservation%`);
  * `cx_revoked_rejected_forever` — a revoked market participant cannot order/settle/refund, ever;
  * `cx_revoked_pay_safety_forever` — composed Identity revocation + payment conservation
    (`CellContract.composeContracts` / `revokedPaySafety` in `Verify/Contract.lean`).
