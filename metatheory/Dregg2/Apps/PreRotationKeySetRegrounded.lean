# `Dregg2.Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded` — the `KeySetCR` consumers RE-GROUNDED off the
FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floor onto a REAL collision game carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `KeySetCR` site)

`PreRotation.KeySetCR hash := ∀ a b : List Key, hash a = hash b → a = b` is stated as **injectivity**
of the key-set digest. `List Key` is INFINITE (any nonempty `Key`) and the deployed digest lands in a
BOUNDED range — 256-bit BLAKE3, or a BabyBear felt — so the floor is **FALSE at deployed parameters by
pigeonhole** (§1, `keySetCR_false_of_finite_range` / `keySetCR_false_blake3`). Every consumer
conditioned on it — `rotate_compromise_resistant`, `rotate_install_unique`,
`rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`, `rotateStepCooled_compromise_resistant`,
`preimage_blocks_cooled_rotation`, `rotateWrite_compromise_resistant` — is therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE**
at real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proofs are clean; the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

The file's own non-vacuity witnesses give FALSE COMFORT, exactly as `HashFloorHonesty`'s header
predicts: `demoHash_CR` satisfies the floor with a TOY INJECTIVE hash (an `Encodable` pairing into all
of `ℤ`) and `badHash_not_CR` refutes it with a constant. Toy witness satisfiable, real hash false.

## The re-grounding (the `HermineHashCRRegrounded` / `Poseidon2KeyedBridge` pattern)

  * **§1 — FALSE AS NAMED.** The counting core (`HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range`)
    fires on `KeySetCR` directly; `keySetCR_false_blake3` is the deployed form.
  * **§2 — the KEYED family.** `KeySetDeployment` bundles the deployed digest with its
    domain-separation tag space (the effective key — the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model,
    `Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1) and the pre-committed next key set at each sampled instance.
    `keySetFamily` lifts it to a `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`; `deployed_hash_is_family_instance`
    and `collisionGame_wins_iff` pin FAITHFULNESS — the game is about the function the cell computes.
  * **§3 — the ROTATION-FORGERY GAME.** A pre-rotation forger is a first-class λ-indexed adversary:
    handed a sampled tag, it WINS iff it produces an ADMITTED rotation whose exhibited key set is NOT
    the committed one. The forgery is IN the win relation, not in a docstring.
  * **§4 — THE REDUCTION.** `forgeryToCollisionFinder` maps a forger to a collision finder by pairing
    its exhibited key set against the committed one; `forgery_wins_imp` proves win-preservation (an
    admitted forgery EXHIBITS `hash newKeys = hash committed` with `newKeys ≠ committed` — a genuine
    collision); `forgery_adv_le` is the advantage inequality by `winProb_le_of_imp`. The reduction is
    the ONLY bridge between hypothesis and conclusion — §6's canary compiles that fact.
  * **§5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.** `rotate_compromise_resistant_advantage_bound` and
    `rotate_install_unique_advantage_bound`: the Boolean "any other key set is REFUSED" / "two
    admitted rotations install the SAME set" become "EXCEPT with negligible probability", from the
    collision floor VIA the reduction.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETER IS THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND IT IS UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the
UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, so it is FALSE wherever collisions
exist — and §1 proves they exist at the deployed digest. §7 instantiates both poles at THIS carrier:
`keySet_floor_top_false_of_compressing` (`Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at deployed parameters, routed through
the counting core — the deployed digest refutes it) and `keySet_floor_bot_vacuous` (`Eff := ⊥` is
vacuous). So `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the open, at every use site: this tree has no cost model
(`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow imitation would be another costume. Hiding the `Eff`
dependence is the disease; naming it is the repair.

## Non-fake

The floor is REFUTABLE (`brokenKeySet_floor_top_false`: a constant digest has a finder winning at
every tag, advantage `1`) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary: the keystone does NOT follow
from the floor applied at some OTHER finder). The OLD `KeySetCR` consumers are KEPT untouched and
doc-marked at the teeth; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the PRE-ROTATION key-set lane. `RosterCR` (`Circuit/CouncilCommit`) is the same shape and is
re-grounded in `Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded`; the queue-root carriers are
`Apps.QueueRootFloorRegrounded`; the STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are
`Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers` / `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge`.

`KeySetCR hash` IS `Function.Injective hash` on the INFINITE `List Key`. The deployed key-set digest
lands in a BOUNDED range (a 256-bit BLAKE3 output, or a BabyBear felt), so the counting core fires —
no digest collision need be exhibited; cardinality suffices, and is the honest statement. -/

/-- A digest function into a BOUNDED integer window has FINITE range (`⊆ Ico 0 q`). The general form
of `HashFloorHonesty.finite_range_of_field_bound` — the domain is arbitrary here because the key-set

/-- **TOOTH — `KeySetCR` is FALSE for any range-bounded key-set digest.** Literally the counting core:
the floor IS injectivity on `List Key`, which is infinite whenever `Key` is inhabited, while a real
digest's range is finite. Stated in the same shape as the flagged siblings' teeth

object `PreRotation`'s own docstring points at ("at the deployed hash it discharges to the
BLAKE3/Poseidon2 floor") — REFUTES the floor. The floor is not merely un-proven at the deployed hash;
it is provably FALSE there, so every `KeySetCR` consumer is vacuous at real parameters. -/

/-- **THE COLLISION THE FALSITY EXHIBITS.** A range-bounded key-set digest has, at every parameter, a
genuine collision — two DISTINCT key sets with equal digests. This is the counting core in the
positive form the game floors below consume: it is what makes the `⊤`-class floor false (§7), and
therefore what makes the `Eff` parameter load-bearing rather than decorative. -/

/-! ## §2 — the KEYED family: domain separation is the key.

The deployed key-set digest is a FIXED unkeyed function; its effective key is the domain-separation
tag (`TAG_*` derive-key prefix) the deployment absorbs ahead of the key set. Modelling that tag as the
key is the standard keyed-from-unkeyed treatment (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1-§2) and is what stops the
"hardcode a known collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed floor. -/

/-- **The deployed key-set commitment scheme.** `hash` is the tag-keyed key-set digest (the deployed
fixed function at each domain-separation tag); `Tag` is the finite, inhabited tag space the CR game
samples; `committed t` is the pre-committed NEXT key set at the sampled instance `t` (the value the
identity cell's `next_keys_digest` register commits to); `deployedTag` is the tag the cell computes. -/

/-- **FAITHFULNESS.** The deployed FIXED digest IS the keyed family's instance at the deployed tag — a
definitional equality, no idealization. So the CR game below is a game about the very function the
identity cell computes. -/

/-- **THE OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE.** If the injective `KeySetCR` held at every tag it would
discharge `CollisionResistant (keySetFamily D)` (no collisions ⟹ every finder's advantage `0`). So the
OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE at the deployed
digest (§1), it was an EMPTY hypothesis. Nothing is lost re-grounding; a false hypothesis is replaced
by one a real digest can satisfy. -/

/-! ## §3 — the key-set COLLISION GAME and the ROTATION-FORGERY GAME, as first-class objects. -/

/-- **THE KEY-SET COLLISION GAME.** Instances are sampled domain-separation tags; the adversary
outputs two key sets and WINS iff they are a GENUINE collision of the deployed digest at that tag —
distinct sets, equal digests. This is the game the floor below quantifies over, with an explicit
adversary class. -/

/-- **THE PRE-ROTATION FORGERY GAME.** The adversary is handed a sampled tag and outputs a rotation
event; it WINS iff the event is ADMITTED by the deployed rotate verb (`rotateStep` returns `some`) yet
exhibits a key set that is NOT the pre-committed one. Winning this game IS the compromise
`rotate_compromise_resistant` rules out: an attacker holding the current signing keys (`cur`, which
the verb ignores) rotating to a set it chose. The forgery is IN the win predicate, read off the real
verb. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE REDUCTION: a pre-rotation forger IS a collision finder. -/

/-- **THE REDUCTION, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A rotation forger becomes a key-set collision finder
by pairing the key set it EXHIBITED against the one the register COMMITTED to. This is not a rename
and not a re-indexing: it is `rotate_exhibits_preimage` read as an extractor — the verb admits only on
an exhibited preimage, so an admitted non-committed rotation hands the pair over directly. -/

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — and this IS `rotate_compromise_resistant`, at the game level.** Wherever
the forger wins, the extracted pair is a GENUINE collision of the deployed digest: admission forces
`hash newKeys = nextDigest = hash committed` (`rotate_exhibits_preimage`, the real verb's guard) while
winning forces `newKeys ≠ committed`. The crypto content lives in a proof term, not in a sentence
about one. -/

at every parameter — both play over the SAME sampled tag space, and every tag the forger wins the
extracted finder wins. A genuine reduction inequality over real game advantages. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.

The Boolean keystones become advantage bounds, derived FROM the collision floor VIA the reduction.
The old statements are kept in `PreRotation`; these are their honest siblings. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `PreRotation.rotate_compromise_resistant`.**

Under the key-set collision floor at the game the reduction actually attacks, a pre-rotation forger
whose extracted finder is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an attacker holding
every current signing key rotates to a set of its own choosing only with negligible probability. The
Boolean "ANY presented key set other than the committed one is REFUSED" becomes "refused EXCEPT with
negligible probability" — which is what a real hash can actually deliver, and what the FALSE injective
floor was standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about
the forgery game, the hypothesis about the collision game, and `forgery_adv_le` is the only bridge
(§6's canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **`hEff` IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard "the reduction is efficient"
side condition, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The floor's honesty
is exactly its `Eff`'s, and §7 prices both poles: `⊤` makes it FALSE at the deployed digest, `⊥`
vacuous. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `PreRotation.rotate_install_unique`.** Two admitted rotations from the same key
state install the same current key set EXCEPT with negligible probability: an adversary producing two
admitted rotations that install DIFFERENT sets is, by the same extractor, a collision finder (both
exhibited sets hash to the one committed digest, so the two sets themselves collide). Under the
collision floor at the extracted finder its advantage is negligible.

finder `B`, NOT the one extracted from the forger — and the proof does not go through: the floor bounds
`B`, and only `forgery_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED finder to the forgery game. Under the OLD free
hypothesis (`hCR : KeySetCR hash` with hypothesis and conclusion sharing the same free `hash`) this
tooth was unwritable. It compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

the reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded key-set digest HAS a collision at every tag (§1's
counting core), so the collision game is always solvable, so the floor at the unrestricted adversary
class is FALSE — and every consumer would be vacuous there. `Classical.choice` is the adversary and no
restatement of the win relation can see it coming. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem
