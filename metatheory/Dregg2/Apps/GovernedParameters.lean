# Dregg2.Apps.GovernedParameters — a constitution-CITING parameter cell (round 2, the cross-cell import home).

`Apps/GovernedNamespaceGated.lean` modelled a governed registry as a single-credential gate plus four
slot caveats. Real, but it left the deepest naturalness gap OPEN: a governed cell that must carry a
parameter FIXED BY A CONSTITUTION in ANOTHER cell. The factory/polis lanes worked around this by COPYING
the constitution value at birth — sound, but not first-class: nothing recorded WHERE the literal came
from, so a verifier could not recompute it and tooling could not say "this is stale". The round-2
`Dregg2.Authority.CrossCellImport` makes that copy first-class and PROVED (`importValid` cites a source
cell's receipt + the value its field held there; the I-confluence keystone shows the cited PAST never
re-orders against the source's future). This app is the userspace HOME of that capability.

A governed-parameter cell publishes operating parameters (a fee, a quorum size) that are NOT free
literals: each is BOUND to a constitution cell's receipt. Updates are GOVERNED by a constitutional BOARD
(a multi-admin committee, the clean `senderMemberOf` form of the toy's single credential) with
PER-PARAMETER actor-bound approval slots, and the constitution pin itself is IMMUTABLE. Every clause is
a constraint of the cell's `RecordProgram`; every refusal is a theorem.

## Why this is not a toy

  * **the unprovenanced parameter.** The naive governed cell stores `fee = 30` as a bare literal — a
    verifier cannot tell whether 30 is the constitution's value or a typo / a quiet override. Here the
    fee slot is bound by `affineEq [(1, fee)] importedFee` where `importedFee` is the value a CITED
    constitution receipt committed (`CrossCellImport.importValid`): the binding is enforced by the SAME
    proved closure algebra as every other guard, and the provenance is non-forgeable by inheritance from
    the constitution chain's tamper-evidence. A parameter that does NOT match the cited constitution
    value is UNSAT (`unprovenanced_parameter_rejected`); a LYING import (claiming the constitution said
    99 when it said 30) fails `importValid` and cannot even be cited (`lying_import_rejected`).
  * **the board impostor.** A parameter update must be SIGNED by a board member, not merely by a
    capability holder. `boardMember` = `senderMemberOf constitutionBoard`: a stranger (or a stolen
    capability) is rejected (`non_board_member_rejected`). And flipping a specific parameter's approval
    slot is ACTOR-BOUND to the board via `anyOf [immutable approve_fee, senderMemberOf board]` — a turn
    that touches the slot must come from a board member (`approval_slot_actor_bound`).
  * **the constitution capture + the version replay.** The constitution PIN (the cited constitution
    cell's identity) is `immutable` — it cannot be silently repointed to a rogue constitution
    (`constitution_pin_immutable`). And the parameter `version` strictly increases — no replay of an old
    parameter set (`version_replay_rejected`).

## The provenance composition (the round-2 wedge)

The binding is a TWO-PART contract, the honest cross-cell story split exactly along the §8 seam:

  1. **provenance** (`CrossCellImport`): `importValid H constitution imp` proves the cited constitution
     receipt is in the constitution's well-linked chain AND the constitution field held `imp.value`
     there. A lie (`imp.value ≠` the committed value) fails this — it cannot be presented. The
     I-confluence keystone (`importValid_stable_under_source_advance`) means this citation never
     re-orders against the constitution's future amendments: a snapshot, dated.
  2. **enforcement** (this cell's program): `affineEq [(1, feeF)] imp.value` makes the local fee slot
     EQUAL the provenanced value, enforced by the cell's `RecordProgram` on every turn. `paramBinding`
     below is that bridge, and `param_binding_matches_constitution` proves the composed contract:
     `importValid` (the value is the constitution's truth) ∧ the cell admits ⇒ the local parameter
     equals the constitution's committed value.

## The parameter cell — its state

  * `version`        — the strictly-increasing parameter-set counter (replay-safe);
  * `constitution`   — the cited constitution cell's identity (IMMUTABLE — no repoint);
  * `fee`            — a governed parameter, BOUND to the constitution's committed value;
  * `approve_fee`    — the board's per-parameter approval slot (actor-bound to the board).

## Honest scope

  * `affineEq`/`senderMemberOf` are decidable record/context predicates proved here. The §8 seam is the
    constitution chain's `HInj`/`HFresh` (the receipt digest's collision-resistance), threaded through
    `CrossCellImport`'s `chain_tamper_evident` — never a Lean axiom.
  * `senderMemberOf` is FREE / i-confluent (a predicate over the single turn's own sender). The import
    is I-confluent (it reads an immutable past receipt). So this whole cell is coordination-free in the
    sense `CrossCellImport` proves — the constitution citation never forces ordering against the
    constitution's amendments.

Discipline: axiom-clean (`#assert_all_clean` at the close), no `sorry`, no `native_decide` —
`decide` / `#guard` / `Exec.Program` + `CrossCellImport` keystone reuse only. `lake build` green (LOCAL).

/-! ## §1 — THE PARAMETER-UPDATE GATE as a `RecordProgram`
(board provenance ∧ version ∧ constitution-pin ∧ parameter-binding).

The update program is a conjunction, each clause a constraint of the cell's `RecordProgram`:

  * `senderMemberOf constitutionBoard` — **board provenance**: an update must be SIGNED BY a board
    member. A stranger (or stolen capability) cannot update the parameters.
  * `strictMono versionF` — **replay-safety**: the parameter version strictly increases.
  * `immutable constitutionF` — **no constitution capture**: the cited constitution pin cannot be
    silently repointed to a rogue constitution.
  * `affineEq [(1, feeF)] importedFee` — **the parameter binding**: the local fee equals the value a
    CITED constitution receipt committed (the provenance is `CrossCellImport.importValid`, §2).
  * `anyOf [immutable approveFeeF, senderMemberOf constitutionBoard]` — **the actor-bound approval
    slot**: flipping the fee-approval slot demands a board-member sender (the multi-admin polis tooth).

The `importedFee` literal is the value the constitution committed — supplied by a PROVED `Import` (§2),
not a free parameter. The conjunction is ONE predicate (all-or-nothing). -/

/-! ## §2 — THE PROVENANCE COMPOSITION: the binding IS a first-class `ImportedEq` (gap-2 adoption).

The round-2 `Authority.ImportBinding.ImportedEq` is exactly the construct this app re-derived by hand: a
cited `Import` PLUS the local field it binds, carrying the provenance obligation (`importValid`, on the
SAME `Import` object) and projecting the enforcement constraint (`toConstraint` = the EXISTING `affineEq`
atom). So `paramBinding imp` is now the `ImportedEq`'s `toConstraint` (NOT a re-spelled `affineEq`), and
its admit-characterization + the composed provenance contract are DIRECT corollaries of the atom's proved
keystones — the two obligations no longer travel as a hand-threaded pair. (A cited import binds the local
field `feeF` when `imp.localField = feeF`; the governed cell only ever cites constitution imports for its
fee slot.) -/

/-- **`paramBinding imp`** — the parameter-binding constraint for a cited constitution import, now the
first-class `ImportedEq`'s projected enforcement constraint (`ImportedEq.toConstraint ⟨imp⟩` =
`.affineEq [(1, imp.localField)] imp.value`). For a fee-citing import (`imp.localField = feeF`) this is the
local fee slot bound to the provenanced value — the binding the cell program enforces, with the provenance
obligation `importValid` riding the SAME `imp`. -/
def paramBinding (imp : Import) : StateConstraint := (ImportedEq.mk imp).toConstraint

/-- **`paramBinding_iff`.** The binding constraint holds exactly when the post-state carries the cited
value at the import's local field — a DIRECT reuse of `ImportedEq.admits_iff` (the atom's proved
single-term affine admit-char), no inline `affineSum`/`affineEq` re-derivation. -/
theorem paramBinding_iff (imp : Import) (o n : Value) :
    evalConstraint (paramBinding imp) o n = true ↔ n.scalar imp.localField = some imp.value :=
  ImportedEq.admits_iff ⟨imp⟩ o n

/-- **`param_binding_matches_constitution` (THE COMPOSED PROVENANCE CONTRACT — now a COROLLARY).** When
the import is VALID (`importValid`: the cited constitution receipt is in the constitution's well-linked
chain AND the constitution field held `imp.value` there) AND the cell admits the binding constraint, the
local parameter EQUALS the value the constitution committed at the cited receipt. The whole cross-cell
contract this app re-derived by hand is now the atom's keystone `importedEq_binds_provenanced_value`,
applied here — provenance (the value is the constitution's truth, non-forgeable) + enforcement (the cell
holds exactly that value), fused in ONE construct. -/
