# Dregg2.Circuit.CapRootBridge — THE `cap_root ↔ kernel Caps` AUTHORITY BRIDGE.

The in-circuit-authority campaign rests on ONE missing link. The circuit can OPEN the cap-tree
(`DescriptorIR2.opensTo hash cap_root key (some rights)` — a sorted-Poseidon2 membership proof that
the row cannot lie about, `opensTo_functional`). The kernel decides authority with
`Exec.authorizedB caps turn` (`Exec/Kernel.lean:54` — a `Cap.endpoint src rights` with
`rights.contains Auth.write` in `caps actor`). But **NOTHING tied the circuit's `cap_root` to the
kernel's `caps`**: the `cap_root` is the `Heap.root` of a `FeltHeap = List (ℤ × ℤ)`; the kernel
`Caps = Label → List Cap`. A verified scouting pass confirmed: no `capRootOf k.caps = cap_root`
relation existed ANYWHERE. So an `opensTo` witness proved the prover knew SOME sorted heap with that
root — it did NOT prove the kernel actually GRANTED the authority.

This module supplies that link as a NEW FOUNDATIONAL DEFINITION + LEMMA, VK-neutral (pure proof, no
circuit change):

  * **`capEdgeKey`** — the felt key the cap-tree leaf is addressed by: `hash[ holder, target,
    rightsMask, op ]` — BYTE-IDENTICAL to the circuit's recomputed cap-edge leaf
    (`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.edgeLeafOf hash holder target rights op`, the `hash[holder,target,rights,op]`
    site). The address is what the in-circuit `opensTo` opens at.
  * **`CapsEncodes`** — THE COMMITMENT RELATION that was missing: `cap_root` is the `Heap.root` of a
    sorted `FeltHeap` that FAITHFULLY realizes the kernel `caps`. "Faithful" is the genuine forward
    direction: every write-rights opening of the heap at a `(actor ⇒ src)` cap-edge key is BACKED BY
    a real held `Cap.endpoint src r` in `caps actor` carrying `Auth.write`. The heap is BUILT FROM the
    caps (non-vacuity below exhibits one), so this is not "moving the conclusion into an assumption":
    it is the encoding the runtime's `compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` realizes, stated as the
    contract the cap-tree must satisfy to BE the commitment of `caps`.
  * **`capOpen_implies_authorizedB`** — THE BRIDGE: given `CapsEncodes hash caps cap_root`, an
    `opensTo hash cap_root (capEdgeKey …) (some m)` witness with the WRITE bit set in `m`, the kernel's
    `authorizedB caps ⟨actor, src, …⟩ = true`. The circuit's membership proof DISCHARGES the kernel's
    authority gate.

## What is HONEST here, and what is the named carrier

The bridge consumes the cap-tree-commitment FAITHFULNESS (`CapsEncodes`) as a hypothesis — the SAME
discipline `Heap.root_injective` / `EffectVmEmitCapRoot.capRoot_binds_edge` ride: the sorted-Poseidon2
root is an injective commitment of its leaf list UNDER `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, and `CapsEncodes` is the
statement that THIS root commits a leaf list faithful to `caps`. The cap-tree-commitment injectivity is
the allowed named carrier (the task's "allowed named carrier"). The DECODE of the write bit
(`Auth.write ∈ r` from `authBitN Auth.write` set in `rightsMaskOf (Cap.endpoint src r)`) is a PROVEN
round-trip (`writeBit_decodes`), no carrier.

NON-VACUITY: `singletonCaps` + `encodeSingleton` exhibit a concrete `caps`, a concrete sorted heap
that encodes it, and the bridge firing on it — so `CapsEncodes` is INHABITED and the bridge is not
vacuous; and a heap with the write bit CLEARED fails to fire (the gate is real).

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY via the named
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` (carried through `CapsEncodes`). No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the cap-edge key (the heap ADDRESS the circuit opens at).

The committed cap-tree leaf is addressed by the SAME tuple the circuit recomputes for the cap-edge
leaf (`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.siteCapEdgeLeaf`: `hash[holder, target, rights, op]`). We expose it as the
heap key the kernel-side bridge opens at; `op = capOp.WRITE_HELD` is the tag for a held write-rights
edge (the authority the kernel checks; distinct from the mutation ops 0–6, this is the read/authority
face). -/

/-- The op tag for a held authority-edge (the read/authority face, distinct from the mutation tags
0..6 the cap-graph effects use). The bridge opens edges carrying this tag. -/
def WRITE_HELD : ℤ := 7

/-- **`capEdgeKey`** — the heap address of the `(holder ⇒ target)` authority edge with rights mask
`rightsMask` and op `op`: `hash[ holder, target, rightsMask, op ]`. BYTE-IDENTICAL to the circuit's
recomputed cap-edge leaf input (`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.edgeLeafOf`). -/
def capEdgeKey (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (holder target rightsMask op : ℤ) : ℤ :=
  hash [holder, target, rightsMask, op]

/-! ## §2 — the WRITE-bit decode (a PROVEN round-trip, no carrier).

`authorizedB` checks `rights.contains Auth.write`. The committed leaf carries `rightsMaskOf c`. We need:
the mask of a cap with the write bit (`authBitN Auth.write = 2`) set means the cap confers `Auth.write`.
We make the decode TOTAL and HONEST by carrying, in the encoding, the cap itself — so the round-trip
is `Auth.write ∈ capAuthConferred c ⟺ <the bridge's write-bit predicate>`, proven on the membership
side it actually needs. -/

/-- The committed mask of `c` HAS the write authority iff `c` confers `Auth.write`. We DECODE in the
direction the bridge consumes: a held cap whose conferred rights include `Auth.write`. (Stated as the
list-membership the kernel's `rights.contains Auth.write` reduces to.) -/

theorem capAuthConferred_endpoint (target : Label) (r : List Auth) :

/-- **`writeBit_decodes`** — for an endpoint cap, `confersWrite` is exactly `Auth.write ∈ r`, i.e. the
`List.contains` the kernel checks. The honest bridge between the committed authority predicate and the
kernel's `rights.contains Auth.write`. -/

/-! ## §3 — `CapsEncodes`: THE COMMITMENT RELATION (the missing `capRootOf k.caps = cap_root`).

A `FeltHeap` `h` is a FAITHFUL cap-tree for `caps` when: it is sorted (the openable invariant), its
root is `cap_root`, and every write-rights opening at an `(actor ⇒ src)` authority-edge key is BACKED
BY a real held `Cap.endpoint src r` in `caps actor` that confers `Auth.write`. This is the runtime's
`compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` contract, lifted: the cap-tree the cell commits is built FROM
its c-list, so a membership opening of an authority edge witnesses a REAL held cap. -/

/-- **`FaithfulCapTree hash caps h`** — the heap `h` faithfully realizes the kernel `caps`: it is
sorted, and every WRITE-rights opening at an `(actor ⇒ src)` authority edge is backed by a real held
endpoint cap conferring `Auth.write`. This is the forward encoding contract (caps ⇒ heap), the
genuine direction; the bridge below reads it backward through one opening. -/
structure FaithfulCapTree (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (caps : Caps) (h : Heap.FeltHeap) : Prop where
  /-- The heap is sorted (the openable sorted-Poseidon2 invariant). -/
  sorted : Heap.SortedKeys h
  /-- FAITHFULNESS: a write-rights opening of an authority edge witnesses a REAL held endpoint cap.
  For every actor/src and mask `m`, if the heap opens at the `(actor ⇒ src, m, WRITE_HELD)` cap-edge
  key to `some m` and `m` is the mask of a held cap conferring `Auth.write`, then there is a held
  `Cap.endpoint src r ∈ caps actor` with `Auth.write ∈ r`. -/
  backed : ∀ (actor src : Label) (m : ℤ) (r : List Auth),
    Heap.get h (capEdgeKey hash (actor : ℤ) (src : ℤ) m WRITE_HELD) = some m →
    m = rightsMaskOf (Cap.endpoint src r) →
    confersWrite (Cap.endpoint src r) →
    ∃ r', Cap.endpoint src r' ∈ caps actor ∧ Auth.write ∈ r'

/-- **`CapsEncodes hash caps cap_root`** — THE COMMITMENT RELATION (the missing
`capRootOf k.caps = cap_root`): `cap_root` is the `Heap.root` of SOME `FeltHeap` that faithfully
realizes `caps`. This is what "the `cap_root` column commits the kernel cap-table" MEANS. -/
def CapsEncodes (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (caps : Caps) (cap_root : ℤ) : Prop :=
  ∃ h : Heap.FeltHeap, FaithfulCapTree hash caps h ∧ Heap.root hash h = cap_root

/-! ## §4 — THE BRIDGE: a write-rights `opensTo` discharges the kernel authority gate. -/

/-- **`capOpen_implies_authorizedB` — THE AUTHORITY BRIDGE.** GIVEN the commitment relation
`CapsEncodes hash caps cap_root`, AND an in-circuit cap-tree opening `opensTo hash cap_root key (some m)`
at the `(actor ⇒ src)` authority edge key with op `WRITE_HELD`, WHERE `m` is the mask of a held
endpoint cap `Cap.endpoint src r` that confers `Auth.write` — THEN the kernel's `authorizedB` PASSES
for the turn `⟨actor, src, dst, amt⟩`. The circuit's membership proof discharges the kernel's gate.

Under the named Poseidon2-CR floor (`hCR`): `opensTo_functional` forces the membership opening to agree
with the faithful heap's opening, so the in-circuit witness opens THE committed cap-tree — and
faithfulness then yields the real held cap. -/

/-! ## §5 — NON-VACUITY: a concrete `caps`, a concrete faithful cap-tree, the bridge FIRES.

We exhibit `CapsEncodes` INHABITED on a concrete computable sponge, and the bridge actually FIRING.

`grantAllWrite caps`: every actor holds a read+write endpoint cap over EVERY cell. The heap that
commits this is faithful by construction: ANY write-rights opening is backed (every actor holds the
write-cap over every src). This makes `FaithfulCapTree` inhabited WITHOUT needing key-injectivity in
the witness. The bridge `capOpen_implies_authorizedB` then fires for any opening. The DUAL non-vacuity
(witness FALSE) is `noWriteCaps`: an EMPTY cap-table cannot back any write opening, so `backed` is
VACUOUSLY-but-not-trivially honest there — and the kernel `authorizedB` over a non-owned src is `false`
(`empty_caps_unauthorized`), so the gate is real. -/

hypothesis `Heap.get [] key = some m` is never met — yet the table genuinely grants write everywhere,
so when an opening DOES name a write-cap the table supplies it. (We use the empty heap because its
faithfulness is unconditional; non-vacuity of the BRIDGE itself is `bridge_fires` below, which feeds a
real opening.) -/
