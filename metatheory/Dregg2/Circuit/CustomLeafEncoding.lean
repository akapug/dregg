# Dregg2.Circuit.CustomLeafEncoding — faithful encoding of a Lean MIRROR of `custom_leaf_adapter.rs`.

⚠ RESOLUTION (see `docs/audit/SEMANTIC-LEAN-BOUNDARY.md`, Class B). This proves faithfulness of a
RE-AUTHORED Lean model, NOT of the deployed Rust lowering. `CellLocal`/`gateBody` are a hand-copy
of the Rust `gate_body` / `cellprogram_to_descriptor2` table (`circuit/src/custom_leaf_lowering.rs`,
`circuit-prove/src/custom_leaf_adapter.rs`), connected to it by PROSE ("term-for-term the Rust")
only — no `@[export]`, no emit, no differential/byte pin (cell/ carries no Lean ffi). It covers
just the 9-of-21 PURE-LOCAL kinds; the cryptographically hard kinds (hash / lookup / table-function)
are omitted (REFUSED by the Rust adapter, not encoded here). And `CellLocalHolds` is DEFINED as the
same `gateBody` vanishing that the encoded gate denotes, so `encodeLocal_holdsAt_iff` /
`cell_to_descriptor_faithful` are a CARRIER-REDUCTION over the Lean model (proving the `.gate`
carrier loses no info) — NOT an independent comparison of the Lean `gateBody` to the deployed Rust
`gate_body`. "The deployed lowering IS faithful" therefore remains UNPROVEN future work
(author-the-lowering-in-Lean-and-emit — Step 4/T3 of the boundary doc).

## What this formalizes (the Lean side of Fork X / G2)

`circuit-prove/src/custom_leaf_adapter.rs` adapts a `CellProgram`'s `CircuitDescriptor` into an
IR-v2 `EffectVmDescriptor2` (`cellprogram_to_descriptor2`), so a custom sub-proof re-proves as a
recursion-foldable IR-v2 leaf and folds into the SAME aggregate tree a light client verifies. For
that re-proof to MEAN anything, the encoding must PRESERVE the constraint semantics: a trace
satisfies the original `CellProgram`'s pure-local algebraic constraints IFF it satisfies the encoded
`EffectVmDescriptor2` constraints. This module is that faithfulness statement, in Lean, over the
Lean denotations `Emit.EffectVmEmit.VmConstraint.holdsVm` and `DescriptorIR2.VmConstraint2.holdsAt`
— which are themselves Lean MIRRORS of the deployed AIR's evaluator, not the deployed AIR (see the
resolution note atop this file).

It is the encoding-side companion to `CustomApex.lean`: that file binds the Custom row's `proofBind`
op to a VERIFYING sub-proof under the named `EngineBinding` carrier (the in-AIR recursion verifier);
THIS file shows the sub-proof's own algebraic constraints survive the `CellProgram → VmConstraint2`
lowering, so the `EngineBinding` carrier is realized over the FAITHFUL descriptor — not a descriptor
that silently dropped or weakened a `CellProgram` gate.

## The mapping mirrored (the Rust `gate_body` / `cellprogram_to_descriptor2` table)

Each PURE-LOCAL `ConstraintExpr` lowers to ONE `VmConstraint2.base (.gate body)` whose polynomial
`body` (an `EmittedExpr`) must vanish per row. `Transition` lowers to a two-row `windowGate`;
`PiBinding` to a row-tag-guarded `base (.piBinding First ..)` — a NAMED NARROWING (every-row →
first-row) the Rust adapter documents.

## Proof obligations (and what is closed vs. labelled)

1. `encodeLocal_holdsAt_iff` — CLOSED: each pure-local gate's encoded `holdsAt` (on a transition
   row) is EXACTLY its body-vanishes semantics. This is the algebraic core: equality / multiply /
   binary / polynomial / gated / inverted-gated / squared / conditional-nonzero / at-least-one all
   ride the single `base (.gate _)` carrier, so faithfulness is the `holdsVm .gate` reduction.
2. `encodeTransition_holdsAt_iff` — CLOSED: the `windowGate` carrier is the cross-row equality.
3. `encodePiBinding_narrows` — the every-row→first-row narrowing is SOUND one way; the converse
   gap is a GENUINE narrowing (witnessed non-vacuous by `encodePiBinding_not_complete`), not an
   equivalence — the follow-up is a per-row PI gate in the IR-v2 main AIR, exactly as the Rust
   adapter's module note says.
4. `cell_to_descriptor_faithful` — CLOSED: the descriptor-level row×constraint re-quantification
   of the per-row core.

All denotations are the field-faithful mod-p residues (`≡ 0 [ZMOD 2013265921]`) — the DSL evaluator
computes over BabyBear, so this IS the cell semantics, not an envelope.

(The former item 5, `engineBinding_over_faithful_encoding`, was a `True := trivial` placeholder for
the now-deleted vacuous `CustomApex.lightclient_unfoolable_custom`; it is RETIRED. The deployed custom
binding is real-as-deployed via the FOLD — `CustomBindingFromFold.custom_binding_from_fold` — not a row
carrier. This file supplies only the faithful-encoding leg; the binding leg is the fold.)

NO new axioms; sorry-free. Import-clean. NOT added to `Dregg2.lean` (the main loop wires imports).

/-! ## §3 — Faithfulness of the pure-local encoding (the CLOSED algebraic core). -/

/-- **The faithful-encoding core.** On any ACTIVE (transition) row (`isLast = false`), the encoded
constraint's IR-v2 denotation is EXACTLY the cell gate's body-vanishes semantics. Every pure-local
kind rides the single `base (.gate _)` carrier, so there is no per-kind gap: the lowering preserves
satisfaction. -/

/-! ## §4 — The two-row `Transition` carrier (CLOSED). -/

/-- The Rust `Transition{next,local}` lowering: a `windowGate` whose body is `nxt next − loc local`,
asserted on the transition domain. -/
def encodeTransition (next locCol : Nat) : VmConstraint2 :=

/-- **The transition carrier is the cross-row equality.** On an active row the encoded `windowGate`
holds iff `nxt[next] = loc[local]` — the faithful, column-general continuity a `CellProgram`
cross-row constraint asks for (the deployed `base .transition` form hard-codes the EffectVM state
window bases, so it cannot carry a generic column pair; `windowGate` can). -/

/-! ## §5 — The `PiBinding` NARROWING (sound one way; the gap witnessed non-vacuous). -/

/-- The Rust `PiBinding{col,pi}` lowering: a FIRST-row-guarded `base .piBinding`. The `CellProgram`
semantics is EVERY row (`loc[col] = pi[idx]` on all rows); the IR-v2 carrier binds only the first
row — a documented narrowing. -/

def CellPiEveryRow (env : VmRowEnv) (col piIndex : Nat) : Prop :=
  env.loc col ≡ env.pub piIndex [ZMOD 2013265921]

/-- **The narrowing is SOUND (every-row ⟹ first-row).** A trace satisfying the `CellProgram`'s
every-row PI binding also satisfies the encoded first-row binding. The CONVERSE is the genuine gap
(first-row alone does NOT recover every-row) — the named follow-up is a per-row PI gate in the IR-v2
main AIR, after which this becomes an `↔`. -/

/-- The narrowing GAP, stated honestly: a first-row binding does NOT imply the every-row binding on
an interior row. Witnessed: a row satisfying the binding (all-zero) and a row violating it
(`loc = 1`, `pub = 0` — not congruent mod p). The IR-v2 per-row PI gate is what would close the
narrowing itself. -/

/-! ## §6 — Descriptor-level faithfulness (CLOSED). -/

/-- A custom leaf's pure-local constraint program (the subset this spike proves; hash/lookup/
table-function kinds are REFUSED by the Rust adapter, not encoded). -/
abbrev CellProgramLocal := List CellLocal

/-- The encoded IR-v2 constraint list. -/
def encodeProgram (p : CellProgramLocal) : List VmConstraint2 := p.map encodeLocal

/-- **Descriptor-level faithful encoding (of the Lean MIRROR — ⚠ NOT the deployed Rust lowering; see
the resolution note atop this file; `CellLocalHolds` is defined as the encoded gate's own body
vanishing, so this is a carrier-reduction).** A multi-row trace satisfies every encoded gate on every
active row iff it satisfies every cell gate on every active row. The per-row equivalence is
`encodeLocal_holdsAt_iff`; this is its row×constraint re-quantification over the trace. (The
wrap-row `isLast` arm is not quantified: the deployed `.gate` is vacuously `True` on the last row —
so the encoded descriptor is, if anything, WEAKER on the wrap row, never stronger; faithfulness on
the active rows is the load-bearing direction.) -/
