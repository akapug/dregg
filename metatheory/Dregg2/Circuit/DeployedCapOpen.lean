# Dregg2.Circuit.DeployedCapOpen — the IN-CIRCUIT cap-tree membership-open (authority leg foundation).

## Why this file exists (the critical-path authority leg)

`DeployedCapTree.lean` models the deployed 7-field depth-16 cap-tree (now committed to the SINGLE
chip absorb `cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb` — the arity-7 leaf + the arity-3 `[FACT_MARK, l, r]` node,
over the one `chipAbsorb` carrier) and proves the KERNEL-side bridge
`deployedCapOpen_implies_authorizedB`: a write-mask `MembersAt` opening implies the kernel's
`authorizedB`. But that bridge consumes `MembersAt` as a HYPOTHESIS — nothing in the circuit
denotation produced it.

This file closes that gap on the CIRCUIT side. It defines a CONSTRAINT — `CapOpenConstraint` — whose
denotation is exactly the in-circuit shape the Rust AIR realizes:

  * the 7 cap-leaf fields ride a Poseidon2 chip ABSORB (arity 7) producing the leaf digest column;
  * each of the depth-16 levels rides an arity-3 chip absorb (the tagged 3-list `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`)
    mixing `(cur, sib)` by the direction bit; the chain's top is CONSTRAINED `== cap_root` column;
  * the leaf's `target` column is CONSTRAINED `== src`, and `mask_lo` to the write-endpoint mask.

## The chip-rate reconciliation (DISCHARGED — decision #1, the gap CLOSED, §A)

The IR-v2 Poseidon2 chip (`DescriptorIR2`, `CHIP_RATE = babyBearD4W16.rate = 8`) realizes ONE rate-8
absorb of the lookup tuple: `chip_lookup_sound` enforces `digest = sponge (inputs.eval)` where
`sponge` is the chip's rate-8 list-hash. The deployed cap primitives are NOW the SAME single chip
absorb (`cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb`, mirrored in `DeployedCapTree`):

  * the leaf `capLeafDigest S = S.chipAbsorb ∘ leafFields` — ONE chip absorb of the 7 fields (arity 7);
  * the node `nodeOf S l r = S.chipAbsorb (packNode l r)` — ONE chip absorb of `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`
    (arity 3).

So the chip's `sponge (leafFields)` IS `capLeafDigest S leaf` and `sponge [FACT_MARK, l, r]` IS
`nodeOf S l r` — definitionally — when `sponge := S.chipAbsorb`. The reconciliation `SchemeRealizedBy
Chip sponge S` is therefore PROVABLE (`chipAbsorb_realizes`, §A): the chip genuinely realizes the
deployed cap hash now. The membership/soundness theorems specialize `sponge := S.chipAbsorb` and
DISCHARGE the bridge internally — it is no longer a carried hypothesis. (The named relation is kept as
documentation of the equations the realization satisfies.)

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY as the named
`CapHashScheme` carrier (`chipAbsorb`/`chipCR`, inherited from `DeployedCapTree`) + the chip-soundness
`ChipTableSound`.

/-! ## §0 — the chip↔scheme realization bridge (NOW DISCHARGED — the chip IS the cap hash).

The chip's rate-8 `sponge : List ℤ → ℤ` realizes the deployed scheme `S` exactly when its single
absorb of the leaf-field list reproduces `capLeafDigest`, and its single absorb of `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`
reproduces `nodeOf`. Since the deployed scheme NOW commits exactly the chip absorb (`capLeafDigest S =
S.chipAbsorb ∘ leafFields`, `nodeOf S l r = S.chipAbsorb (packNode l r)`), the chip whose `sponge` is
`S.chipAbsorb` satisfies both equations DEFINITIONALLY — see `chipAbsorb_realizes` (§A). -/

/-- **`SchemeRealizedByChip sponge S`** — the chip's rate-8 list-hash `sponge` reproduces the deployed
cap scheme `S`'s leaf and node digests. With the cap-tree re-committed to the chip absorb, this is
DISCHARGED by `sponge := S.chipAbsorb` (`chipAbsorb_realizes`), not carried. (Kept as a named record
of the realization equations; `packNode S l r = [FACT_MARK, l, r]` is the chip's node block.) -/

/-! ## §1 — the column plan for one cap-membership row.

(The COLUMN LAYOUT and the chip LOOKUPS are exactly what the Rust AIR realizes; with the cap-tree
re-committed to the chip absorb, the digest the chip soundness yields IS the deployed scheme's
`capLeafDigest`/`nodeOf` — no reconciliation step, the bridge discharges by `rfl`.) -/

/-- The column layout for a cap-membership row. All indices abstract `Nat`; the Rust AIR pins them.
Phase H-CAP-8: `leafDigest`, `sib`, `node`, `capRoot` are 8-COLUMN GROUPS (`Fin 8 → Nat`) carrying
the native 8-felt digest; the 7 spare permutation lanes per absorb are PROMOTED into the bound 8-felt

  to THIS column (not the constant `EFFECT_TRANSFER`), so the cap-open authorizes the turn's genuine
  effect. The deployed transfer descriptor commits `EFFECT_TRANSFER` here (byte-faithful). -/

  /-- **(residual (a) — GENUINE MEMBERSHIP) The 16-bit decomposition of the leaf's low mask limb.**
  `bit i` is the boolean column carrying bit `i` of `mask_lo` (`i < MASK_BITS = 16`). The membership
  gate `facetEffGate` is NOT an equality `mask_lo == effBit`; it is the genuine `(effBit &&& mask_lo) =
  effBit` SUBMASK test, enforced soundly in-circuit by: booleaning each `bit i` (`maskBitBoolGate`),
  reconstructing `mask_lo = Σ bitᵢ·2ⁱ` (`maskReconGate`), and gating the SELECTED bit (bit `n`, where
  `effBit = 1 <<< n`) to `1` (`facetEffGate` ≡ the selected-bit clause). A BROAD honest cap
  (`mask_lo = 0xFFFF`, all 16 facets) decomposes with bit `n` set, so it PERMITS the effect — the
  over-strict equality gate it replaces would reject it. -/

/-! ### residual (a) — the GENUINE SUBMASK-MEMBERSHIP facet gate (NOT an equality).

The kernel predicate is `is_effect_permitted(Some m, bit) = (bit &&& m ≠ 0)` (`facet.rs:123`) — a
SUBMASK/membership test over the FULL `EffectMask` `m`, NOT equality. For a single effect bit `effBit =
1 <<< n`, that is exactly "bit `n` of `m` is set". The decoded facet is `m = maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi
= mask_lo + mask_hi·65536` (the full u32 effect mask). The over-strict equality `mask_lo == effBit` it
replaces rejects every honest BROAD cap; this membership accepts any cap whose bit `n` is set — AND it
does NOT pin `mask_hi = 0` (a broad cap `EFFECT_ALL` has `mask_hi = 0xFFFF`, bit 1 still in `mask_lo`).

We enforce the membership soundly via a 32-bit decomposition of the FULL mask `m`:
  (1) booleanity — each `bit i` is `0` or `1` (`maskBitBoolGate`);
  (2) recomposition — `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi = Σ_{i<32} bitᵢ·2ⁱ` (`maskReconGate`), binding the
      bits to the committed FULL mask (both limbs);
  (3) the SELECTED-bit gate — bit `n` is `1` (`facetEffGate` / `selectedBitGate n`), where `n =
      log2 effBit` is the descriptor's compile-time effect index.
Bit `n` set + the recomposition ⟹ `(2ⁿ &&& m) = 2ⁿ ≠ 0`, i.e. the genuine `isEffectPermitted`. -/

/-- The width of the FULL `EffectMask` bit decomposition (a deployed `u32` — `EFFECT_ALL =
0xFFFF_FFFF`). The decoded facet `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi = mask_lo + mask_hi·65536` is the full
32-bit mask, so the decomposition spans all 32 bits: any deployed effect-kind bit `1 <<< n` (`n < 32`,
up to `EFFECT_ATTENUATE_CAPABILITY = 1 <<< 23`) is selectable, AND a broad cap (`EFFECT_ALL`, mask_hi =
0xFFFF) decomposes fully. The Rust twin is `CAP_OPEN_MASK_BITS`. -/

`selectedBitGate c n` pins `bitₙ − 1 = 0` (bit `n` is `1`). Together with `maskBitBoolGate`/`maskReconGate`

/-! ## §8.G — F6: the cap-open confers the GENERAL tier × facet (decoded, not pinned).

`capOpen_confers` above discharges `confersTransferLeaf … .signature` because the live descriptor's
`authTagGate` pins `auth_tag = 1` (Signature) and `transferFacetGate` pins `mask_lo = EFFECT_TRANSFER`.
F6 generalizes BOTH axes OFF THE COMMITTED LEAF:

  * **the TIER** (`§10` named residual) — instead of concluding the constant `.signature`, decode the
    committed `auth_tag` to `tierOfTag vkOfTag auth_tag` and conclude `confersTransferLeaf` for THAT
    tier against any `provided` the off-circuit AuthContext supplies that satisfies it. No `auth_tag`
    pin needed: the tier is GENUINELY read off the committed byte.
  * **the FACET** — `facetOfLeaf` already decodes the genuine `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi`; the
    general gate checks `isEffectPermitted` of the decoded mask against the turn's effect bit, rather
    than pinning the mask to a TRANSFER constant.

So `capOpen_confers_decoded` concludes `confersLeaf` for the GENERAL `(effectBit, provided)` from the
committed leaf, given only that the decoded facet permits `effectBit` and the decoded tier is
satisfied by `provided` — both read off the COMMITTED row, not pinned. -/

/-- **`capOpen_confers_decoded` (F6) — the cap-open confers the GENERAL tier × facet, DECODED.** From
a `Satisfied` row (the in-circuit membership open) plus the two facts read off the COMMITTED leaf —
the decoded facet `facetOfLeaf` permits `effectBit`, and the decoded tier `tierOfTag auth_tag` is
satisfied by `provided` — the leaf confers `effectBit` authority under `provided` (`confersLeaf`). The
tier is the GENUINE committed byte (NOT the Signature constant the `authTagGate` pins); the facet is
the GENUINE decoded `maskOfLimbs` (NOT the TRANSFER constant). This discharges the §10 tier residual:
the cap-open authorizes the general tier × facet, off the committed leaf. -/

/-! ## §8.E — residual (a): the IN-CIRCUIT GENERAL FACET gate (`facetEffGate`, not the constant pin).

`capOpen_confers`/`Satisfied.facetTransfer` pin `mask_lo = EFFECT_TRANSFER` — a CONSTANT, so the cap-open
only ever authorizes the transfer facet. `facetEffGate` instead binds `mask_lo` to the turn's ACTUAL
effect-bit COLUMN `effBit`. The lemma below shows that gate IS a genuine in-circuit `isEffectPermitted`:
if `facetEffGate` holds (`mask_lo = env.effBit`), `facetHiGate` holds (`mask_hi = 0`), and the committed
`effBit` is a nonzero single effect bit `1 <<< n`, then the decoded facet PERMITS that effect — and a
leaf whose `mask_lo` is any OTHER value fails the gate (the wrong-facet rejection). This is the genuine
facet generalization: the binding is against a committed column, not a constant. -/

/-- **`facetEffGate_permits` (residual (a) — the in-circuit general `isEffectPermitted`, GENUINE
SUBMASK over the FULL mask).** Given the genuine membership data — each mask bit column boolean
(`hboolGate`), the 32-bit decomposition reconstructing the FULL mask `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi`
(`hrecon`), and the SELECTED bit `n` set (`hsel`, `n < 32`) — the leaf's DECODED facet PERMITS the
effect bit `1 <<< n`: `isEffectPermitted (facetOfLeaf leaf) (1 <<< n) = true`. This is the genuine
`(2ⁿ &&& m) ≠ 0` SUBMASK membership over the full mask `m`: bit `n` of the committed full mask is set, so
a BROAD honest cap (`EFFECT_ALL`, mask_hi = 0xFFFF) PERMITS the effect — NO `mask_hi = 0` pin is required
(the decode is the genuine full mask), and the over-strict equality gate this replaces would reject it. -/

/-! ## §A — THE CHIP-RATE GAP IS CLOSED (`SchemeRealizedByChip` DISCHARGED, not carried).

Decision #1: the cap-tree is re-committed to the chip's hash (`cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb`,
mirrored as `DeployedCapTree`'s single `chipAbsorb` carrier). So the chip whose `sponge` is
`S.chipAbsorb` realizes the deployed scheme DEFINITIONALLY — `chipAbsorb_realizes` (§0) supplies it,
and every soundness theorem above specializes `sponge := S.chipAbsorb` and discharges the bridge in
place. There is NO carried `SchemeRealizedByChip` hypothesis on the live path anymore.

The realization is NON-VACUOUS in the load-bearing sense: it is the chip-absorb collision-resistance
`S.chipCR` (a `Compress1CR`, primitive #4 — NOT `True`; a constant compression falsifies it) that
makes the membership leg's anti-ghost (`recomposeUp_inj_of_path`, `nodeOf_injective`,
`capLeafDigest_injective`) bite. We re-state the discharge as the headline fact, and pin that the
node and leaf domains are length-disjoint (the chip's per-row arity seeding that lets one `chipAbsorb`
serve both shapes). -/

/-- **THE DISCHARGE, re-stated as the §A headline.** The deployed scheme's own chip-absorb carrier
realizes the scheme — `SchemeRealizedByChip S.chipAbsorb S` holds (both equations by `rfl`). The
chip-rate gap the prior revision carried is CLOSED: the IR-v2 chip genuinely realizes the cap hash. -/
theorem schemeRealizedByChip_discharged {State : Type} (S : CapHashScheme State) :
    SchemeRealizedByChip S.chipAbsorb S :=
  chipAbsorb_realizes S

/-- The node block `packNode l r = [FACT_MARK, l, r]` (length 3) and any leaf-field block `leafFields
leaf` (length 7) are LENGTH-DISJOINT — the structural fact behind the chip serving both arities from
one `chipAbsorb` (the chip seeds by `(arity, padded inputs)`, so the two shapes never alias). -/

/-! ## §10.E — THE EFFECT-GENERAL CAP-OPEN (fan-out: any cap-authorized effect-kind, not just transfer).

`Satisfied`/`capOpen_authorizes` PIN the facet to `EFFECT_TRANSFER` (via `effBitGate`/`transferFacetGate`/
`authTagGate` constants), so they only ever authorize a TRANSFER-facet, Signature-tier cap. The fan-out to
the OTHER cap-authorized effects (delegate, introduce, grantCap, revoke, refreshDelegation, …) reuses the
WHOLE appendix verbatim EXCEPT the `effBitGate` constant: each effect's cap-open pins its OWN `EFFECT_<kind>`
bit `1 <<< n` in the `effBit` column, and the GENERAL `facetEffGate` binds `mask_lo = effBit`, so the cap
must permit THAT effect-kind. This section generalizes the gate by the bit exponent `n` and proves the
effect-general authority bridge into `authorizedFacetEffB … (1 <<< n)`.

The membership leg (`MembersAt`) and the target leg (`leaf.target = src`) are SHARED with `Satisfied` — they
read no effect-bit column. We factor them as a membership CORE (`MembershipCore`) that both `Satisfied` and
`SatisfiedEff` provide, so `capOpen_membership`/`capOpen_target` are restated over the core and reused. -/

/-- **`membershipCore_opens` — the core IS a `MembersAt8` opening** (the 8-felt fold over the four
shared fields). NOW an alias for `capOpen_membership8` (`MembershipCore` is defined in §5 and the
8-felt sound lemmas already consume it directly — no duplicated fold). -/
