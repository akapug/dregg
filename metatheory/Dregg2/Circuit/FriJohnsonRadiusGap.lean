# `FriJohnsonRadiusGap` — the `M = 1` discharge does NOT reach the radius FRI operates at

**The finding.** `FriArityFiberDischarge.arity8_phase_injective` discharges `hΦ` for words that are
`dOut ≥ 496`-far of the `512`-point deployed domain — relative farness `496/512 = 96.875%`. FRI's
proven soundness argument operates at the **Johnson radius** `δ_J = 1 − √ρ`, which at the deployed
rate `ρ = 1/64` is `1 − 1/8 = 87.5%`, i.e. `dOut = 448`. **The band `[448, 496)` — every word a
cheating prover is actually allowed to submit — is NOT covered by the discharge.**

This file settles what is in that band, and the answer is not "an unexplored gap". It is:

## ⚑ FINDING 1 — `M = 1` is FALSE at the Johnson radius. The `496` threshold is TIGHT.

`fPow2N` (§2) — the word `x ↦ (ω^x)^(2n)`, the `2n`-th power monomial — is
`(|ι| − 2n − 1)`-far from the dimension-`n` code (`fPow2N_far`), and its phase map is **NOT
injective**: it is constant `1` on BOTH the fibre `0` and the fibre `2^(b−1)`, so
`Φ(0) = Φ(2^(b−1)) = (1, 0, …, 0)` (`fPow2N_phase_not_injective`).

At the deployed config that word is **`495`-far** — exactly **one** below the discharge's `496`
(`deployed_discharge_threshold_tight`). So `phase_injective_of_far`'s hypothesis
`|ι| ≤ 2n + dOut` cannot be weakened by a single point: at `dOut = 495` the conclusion is already
false. The threshold is not an artifact of the proof method that a cleverer argument might lower —
it is the exact truth boundary.

And since `495 ≥ 448`, the SAME word is Johnson-far: `fPow16Wrap` is `448`-far with a non-injective
phase map (`deployed_M1_false_at_johnson`). **There is no theorem to be had at the Johnson radius;
`M = 1` is simply false there.**

## ⚑ FINDING 2 — the gap is STRUCTURAL, at every shipped config, not a numerical accident

The discharge needs relative farness `1 − 2n/|ι| = 1 − 2^(1−b)`; Johnson gives `1 − 2^(−b/2)`. The
discharge threshold is strictly ABOVE Johnson exactly when `2^(1−b) < 2^(−b/2)`, i.e. `b > 2`
(`discharge_threshold_above_johnson`). **Every shipped config has `logBlowup ∈ {3, 6}`**, so every
shipped config has an uncovered band. Raising the blowup — the lever that buys query bits — makes
this gap WIDER, not narrower.

## ⚑ FINDING 3 — what IS true at the Johnson radius: `M ≤ 7`, and the count that follows

`far_fiber_card_arity` does not vanish at Johnson; it degrades. At `dOut = 448`, `|ι| = 512`, `n = 8`
it gives `8·|Y| + 448 < 512`, i.e. `|Y| ≤ 7` (`johnson_fiber_le_seven`) — the same `M = 7` the
arity-2 file already reports at ITS Johnson radius (`FriProximityGapWitness.wrap_fiber_le_seven` at
`dOut = 112` of `128`). The tree has always known `M = 7` is the Johnson-radius truth; what was new
was reading a `96.9%`-radius statement as if it covered `87.5%`.

`good_card_le_of_phase_injective` cannot consume `M = 7`: with a non-injective `Φ`, `H y − H z` is
the ZERO polynomial for same-phase pairs and the root count says nothing. §4 supplies the honest
replacement, `good_card_le_of_phase_fiber_le`, by counting ORDERED pairs of DISTINCT phase:

  `|Good| · (s² − M·s) ≤ (m − 1) · |κ| · (|κ| − 1)`.

⚑ It **recovers `14112` exactly** at `M = 1, s = 2` (`fiber_le_recovers_arity8_count`) — the
anti-mirror check that this is the right generalization, not a second model.

At the Johnson radius the honest instantiation is `M = 7` and `s = 8` — and `s = 8` is not a choice:
`|κ| − dIn = 64 − 56 = 8` is exactly the folded code's OWN Johnson agreement floor `√ρ·|κ|`, the wall
`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp` §5 already names. `s > M` holds by **exactly one**. The count is
`|Good| ≤ 7·64·63/(8·8 − 7·8) = 14112·2/8 = 3528` (`arity8_johnson_good_card_le`) ⟹ **~111 bits**
(`arity8_johnson_perFold_soundness`).

## ⚑ WHAT THE DEPLOYED PER-FOLD COLUMN ACTUALLY RESTS ON

`FriLedger.perFoldBits = 109` at the deployed wrap is `arity8_good_card_le`'s `14112` at `s = 2`,
whose `hΦ` is discharged ONLY for `dOut ≥ 496`. So the ledger's `109` is a claim about
**`96.9%`-far words**, not about the `87.5%`-far words FRI must reject. It is TRUE and it is
NON-VACUOUS (`fPow8Wrap` is `503`-far), but it does not cover the operating regime.

The Johnson-radius number is **`111`** (`|Good| ≤ 3528`) — HIGHER, because it is a WEAKER claim:
it bounds only the challenges folding to within `dIn = 56` (agreement `≥ 8`), where `109` bounds the
far larger family folding to within `dIn = 62` (agreement `≥ 2`). **These are different objects and
neither dominates the other.** Reporting them as one column was the error. `FriLedger.perFoldBits`'
field doc now names its radius; the Johnson reading is proved HERE and deliberately not exported,
because its `M`/`s` instantiation is only integral at even `logBlowup` (`√ρ·|κ|` is irrational at
`lb = 3`) and inventing a rounding would be inventing a number.

## ⚑ WHAT WAS ALREADY IN-TREE, AND WHAT WAS NOT — the honest scope of this file

**The ARITY-2 Johnson radius was never open.** `FriProximityGapWitness.wrap_friProximityGap_johnson`
proves `FriProximityGapChallenges friSetupWrapRate 112 42 26` and
`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.wrap_correlatedAgreementLine` proves
`CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 56 292` — both at `dOut = 112` of `128`, which IS
`(1 − √ρ)·128` at `ρ = 1/64`. Those are genuine Johnson-radius results, by the sharper Fisher/packing
route, and §5's generic count agrees with them (`arity2_johnson_generic_is_consistent_with_sharp`).

**What was open is the DEPLOYED config, which folds at ARITY 8.** `friSetupWrapRate` is
`FriSetup BabyBear (Fin (2^7)) (Fin (2^6))` — a 2-to-1 fold on `128` points. The deployed prover runs
`IR2_FRI_MAX_LOG_ARITY = 3`, and `FriLedger`'s `perFoldBits = 109` reads `arity8_good_card_le`'s
`14112` over the `512`-point `friSetupK8Wrap`. That the arity-2 results do not transfer to arity 8 is
the entire reason `FriArityTransfer` exists. So the arity-2 Johnson machinery does not close this,
and the near-capacity `arity8_phase_injective` does not reach Johnson. That gap is what this file
finds, proves FALSE-not-open, and then supplies the arity-8 Johnson count for.

`#assert_axioms` is blind to HYPOTHESES — and this file is the demonstration of why that matters:
`arity8_phase_injective` is kernel-clean, `sorry`-free, non-vacuous, and TRUE, and it still did not
cover the regime the ledger quoted it for. Only reading the STATEMENT finds that.

/-- **⚑ THE HONEST REPLACEMENT COUNT — the `M`-bounded ORDERED-pair double count.**
`good_card_le_of_phase_injective` needs `M = 1`: it counts UNORDERED pairs and needs every pair to
have `H y ≠ H z`, which fails outright once two fibres share a phase vector. This version takes the
fiber bound as a NUMBER `M` rather than as injectivity, and counts only the ordered pairs of DISTINCT
phase:

  `|Good| · (s² − M·s) ≤ (m − 1) · |κ| · (|κ| − 1)`.

*Proof.* Double-count incidences `(β, (y,z))` with `y, z ∈ S β` and `Φ y ≠ Φ z`.
**Lower:** each `β ∈ Good` has `|S β| = t ≥ s`; the SAME-phase ordered pairs in `S β` number
`Σ_{y ∈ S β} |{z ∈ S β : Φ y = Φ z}| ≤ M·t` (each inner set sits inside `y`'s phase class), so the
distinct-phase ones number `≥ t² − M·t ≥ s² − M·s` (using `t ≥ s ≥ M`).
**Upper:** each distinct-phase ordered pair lies in `≤ m − 1` of the `S β` (`pair_mem_card_le` — the
root count of the nonzero `H y − H z`), and distinct phase forces `y ≠ z`, so there are `≤ |κ|(|κ|−1)`
such pairs. ∎

⚑ The content needs `s > M`. At `M = s` the bound reads `0 ≤ …` and says nothing — which is the
honest reading of "the agreement set may be a single phase class", not a defect. -/

is not a mirror.** At arity 2 the tree ALREADY has a Johnson-radius count, by a DIFFERENT method (the
Fisher/packing route of `FriProximityGapWitness` §F, sharpened in `FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp` §§3b-6):
`wrap_correlatedAgreementLine : CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 56 292` — at the SAME
Johnson outer radius (`dOut = 112` of `128` = `(1−√ρ)·128`), the SAME folded-code Johnson inner
radius (`dIn = 56`), hence the SAME `M = 7` (`wrap_fiber_le_seven`) and the same agreement floor
`s = 64 − 56 = 8`. It bounds the same object §4 does: the challenges whose fold is `56`-close to the
constants, i.e. constant on `≥ 8` fibres.

§4's generic bound at `m = 2, M = 7, s = 8, |κ| = 64` gives `|Good|·(8·8 − 7·8) ≤ 1·64·63 = 4032`,
i.e. `|Good| ≤ 504`. The tree's specialized result is `292`.

**`292 ≤ 504`: consistent, with the generic bound the weaker one.** So §4 does not contradict a
sharper independently-proved result at the same instantiation — it is the arity-generic version of
it, checked against it, and it reaches where the arity-2 packing method cannot (arity 8, which is
what the deployed prover actually runs). ⚑ It also prices the generality honestly: at arity 2 the
generic route costs ~0.8 bits against the specialized one, so `3528`/`111` at arity 8 should be read
as a bound the specialized method might yet sharpen — not as the last word. -/
