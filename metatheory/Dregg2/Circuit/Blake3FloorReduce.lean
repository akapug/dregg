# `Dregg2.Circuit.Blake3FloorReduce` — the BLAKE3 floors, falsified as injectivity and rebuilt as
reduction twins over `CollisionReduce`.

## The disease (same as the Poseidon2 floors, previously toothless here)

Two BLAKE3 carriers in the tree are stated as **injectivity**:

  * `PortalFloor.Blake3Kernel.noCollision : collisionHard → ∀ x y, hash x = hash y → x = y`
    (`Dregg2/Crypto/PortalFloor.lean:178`) — the transcript/attribute hash.
  * `ThresholdDecrypt.Blake3Prf : ∀ key s₁ i₁ s₂ i₂, blake3Mac key s₁ i₁ = blake3Mac key s₂ i₂ →
    s₁ = s₂ ∧ i₁ = i₂` (`Dregg2/Distributed/ThresholdDecrypt.lean:289`) — the share-MAC carrier.

Both force an *infinite* message space (`List Nat`; `Nat × Nat` per key) into a digest. The real
BLAKE3 digest is 32 bytes — a FINITE space — so the injectivity these carriers assert is false by
pigeonhole: collisions EXIST; collision-resistance only means they are hard to FIND. Every theorem
conditioned on such a carrier is vacuously true at real parameters. `HashFloorHonesty` bit the
Poseidon2 floors (`poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`); the BLAKE3 floors had no tooth. This file
closes both, then builds the honest replacement.

## What this file provides

  * **§1 — FALSIFICATION.** `Blake3NoCollision` names the exact carrier shape; it is proved FALSE
    for any hash into a finite digest type (`blake3_noCollision_false_of_finite_digest`) and for any
    range-bounded `Nat`-valued hash (`blake3_noCollision_false_bounded`, the ≤ 2²⁵⁶ deployed form).
    Lifted to the class: any `Blake3Kernel` instance over a finite `Digest` has an UNSATISFIABLE
    `collisionHard` carrier (`blake3Kernel_collisionHard_false`). Same for the MAC:
    `macPrfShape_false_of_bounded` and its `Blake3Prf` corollary. MODELING NOTE, stated honestly:
    `blake3Mac` is `opaque`, so nothing about its range is provable in Lean; the `Blake3Prf`
    falsification is CONDITIONAL on the range bound (`∀ s i, blake3Mac key s i < B`) — which is
    exactly the honest model of a 32-byte tag (`B = 2²⁵⁶`). The kernel-level tooth needs only
    `Finite Digest`, which every real digest type satisfies.

  * **§2 — REDUCTION TWINS** (the `CollisionReduce` de-vacuation). Break events `Blake3Collision`
    / `MacCollision`; dichotomy leaves `blake3_orBreak` / `mac_orBreak` (mirroring
    `spongeN_orBreak` / `compress_orBreak`); the committed-opening twin
    `blake3_commit_opens_orBreak` (the de-vacuated `blake3_floor_cr`); the share-MAC twin
    `share_mac_detects_tamper_orBreak` over the REAL `opaque blake3Mac` (the de-vacuated
    `share_mac_detects_tamper` — same conclusion, NO `Blake3Prf` hypothesis); `_of_no_collision`
    recoveries; and the apex `Blake3Break` with a composed transcript+share theorem via
    `OrBreak.map₂`/`weaken`. `blake3Prf_implies_no_macCollision` pins that the twin is a strict
    weakening: the old carrier implies the no-break side, so nothing downstream is lost.

  * **§3 — FIRE, both directions.** A colliding toy mac (`collidingMac`) on which the twin, fed a
    concrete pass equality between DIFFERENT shares, is forced into the Break branch and delivers a
    genuine `MacCollision`; a colliding toy hash (`toyHash2`, parity — plus a `Blake3Kernel Bool`
    instance whose carrier §1 refutes); and an injective toy (`injToyHash = id`) on which
    `¬ Blake3Collision` is proved and `resolve` recovers binding verbatim on a concrete opening.
    The good branch and the break branch are both exercised on closed terms — the dichotomy is
    load-bearing in both directions.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on every theorem: ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. No sorry/admit,
no native_decide, no new axiom. This file EDITS NOTHING — PortalFloor and ThresholdDecrypt keep
their record; the falsification + twins live here over the same shapes.

/-! ## §2 — REDUCTION TWINS: the same conclusions, injectivity replaced by a concrete Break.

⚠⚠ **THESE TWINS ARE TRIVIALLY TRUE AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS — the FOURTH COSTUME.** `OrBreak Break P`
is `Break ∨ P`, and `Blake3Collision` is an EXISTENCE claim that `blake3Collision_of_finite_digest`
(below, in THIS section) PROVES for every finite-digest hash — i.e. for the real 32-byte BLAKE3. So
every twin here is discharged by `OrBreak.broke (blake3Collision_of_finite_digest hash)` **without
ever looking at its hypotheses**: `Circuit.Blake3FloorEffRegrounded.orBreak_twin_trivial_at_finite_digest`
compiles exactly that, and `orBreak_trivial_for_any_conclusion` sharpens it — at a finite digest
`OrBreak (Blake3Collision hash) P` holds for **ANY `P` whatsoever, including a FALSE one**, so a
twin's truth is independent of its conclusion and cannot be evidence for it.

§1's falsification is CORRECT and stands. What fails is the prescribed repair: replacing a FALSE
hypothesis with a TRUE disjunct relocates the vacuity, it does not remove it. `HashFloorHonesty`'s
`mod2_dumb_negligible` named this exact conflation — existence of a collision does NOT by itself break
CR — and the `OrBreak` shape reproduces it on the other side of the turnstile.

⚠ **`blake3Collision_of_finite_digest`'s docstring below reads "the Break side is a THEOREM for the
real (finite-digest) hash. The twin's break branch is not decorative." That is backwards**, and it is
the sharpest sentence in the finding: a break branch that is a THEOREM is not non-decorative — it is
an escape hatch this file proved is always open. §3's "FIRE: both branches exercised" fires the break
branch on TOY hashes; at the deployed hash the break branch is the ONLY branch.

Likewise `blake3_binds_of_no_collision` / `share_mac_detects_tamper_of_no_collision` take
`¬ Blake3Collision hash`, which `blake3NoCollision_iff_no_break` proves IS the falsified carrier —
vacuous in the ordinary way (`Blake3FloorEffRegrounded.no_collision_hypothesis_false_at_finite_digest`).

**The honest replacement is `Circuit.Blake3FloorEffRegrounded`** — the break must be about FINDING,
not EXISTENCE: `blake3_commit_opens_advantage_bound` bounds an equivocating opener's ADVANTAGE at a
real collision game via a real reduction, carrying an explicit undischarged `Eff`. Everything in this
section is KEPT so §1's teeth, §3's fire, and the record keep compiling. -/
