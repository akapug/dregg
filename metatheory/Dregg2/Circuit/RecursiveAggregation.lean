# Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation — RECURSIVE-AGGREGATION SOUNDNESS (magnesium → gold).

**The headline.** A light client that verifies ONE succinct aggregate proof — and re-witnesses
NOTHING of the history — learns that the WHOLE chain of N finalized turns is correct:
every turn executed correctly per the verified executor, the chain is correctly ordered (no
reorder/drop/insert), and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. This is the model
that the IVC accumulator (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::prove_turn_chain_recursive` →
`WholeChainProof`) realizes; `verify_turn_chain_recursive` checks only the root, cost independent of N.

**Why proofs are ADDITIVE ATTESTATION here, and that is the POINT.** The light client does NOT
re-execute the history, does NOT re-hash the states, does NOT walk the blocklace. It checks the
succinct aggregate. The aggregate's validity, UNDER the named soundness hypotheses below, IS exactly
`HistoryAggregation.WellFormedChain` (`aggregate_attests_whole_history`) — so trusting the aggregate
is trusting the whole history. The verification IS the trust.

**What is PROVED vs. what is a NAMED, REALIZABLE hypothesis (the boundary).** You cannot prove
plonky3/pickles FRI-recursion soundness in Lean — it is the soundness of a concrete Rust prover over
a concrete field. So we NAME the three soundness facts the recursion engine supplies, as `structure`
fields the headline takes as hypotheses (each realizable: it is the standard SNARK soundness of a
fixed verifier circuit, which `DESIGN-recursion-aggregation-private-joint-turns.md` §H1 argues is a
BOUNDED obligation for plonky3's single fixed verifier AIR + differential testing):

  * **`InnerProofSound`** — an inner whole-turn step proof that VERIFIES attests the verified executor
    ran that turn (`recCexec pre turn = some post`). This is the EffectVm/descriptor
    circuit⟺executor soundness, ALREADY proved per-effect in Lean (`WholeTurnTriangle`,
    `EffectVmEmit*`) — here lifted to the leaf-proof boundary as the realized hypothesis the
    recursion engine carries up.
  * **`BindingAirSound`** — a `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf proof that VERIFIES attests the temporal
    tooth `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` over the whole chain (`HistoryAggregation.ChainBound`). The
    AIR's continuity constraint is `ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`; its in-circuit soundness is what the leaf
    proof's verification delivers.
  * **`RecursiveVerifierSound`** — an AGGREGATE proof that VERIFIES attests EVERY wrapped child leaf
    proof verifies. This is the recursion engine's in-circuit verifier (`verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit`
    run as a circuit, `prove_aggregation_layer`) being sound — the ONE big FRI obligation (§H1), the
    part outside Lean.

EVERYTHING ELSE — that these three, COMPOSED, yield the full `WellFormedChain` attestation, and hence
the whole-history correctness + conservation — is PROVED here in Lean, gap-free. The composition is
the load-bearing content: it is where a real aggregation bug (verify proof-of-step-7 but export
step-3's roots; swap a leg; drop a turn) would HAVE to show up, and the proof shows the named
hypotheses leave no such gap.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}). The named
hypotheses are `structure` FIELDS, not axioms — they appear in the theorem statements, witnessed
non-vacuously (§5: a realizing instance exists). Verified with
`lake build Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation`.

/-! ## 0. The SNARK proof object + verifier (opaque carriers).

`Proof` is an abstract STARK/recursion proof (the `RecursionCompatibleProof` /
`RecursionOutput` of `plonky3_recursion_impl`). `verify` is the native verifier
(`verify_recursive_batch_proof`). We treat them as opaque — the WHOLE point is that the light client
calls `verify` and nothing else. Soundness of `verify` w.r.t. the protocol is supplied by the named
hypotheses; we never inspect a proof's internals. -/

/-! ## 1. The aggregate artifact — the light client's whole view.

`Aggregate` is the `WholeChainProof` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:430`): the single root recursion proof, plus
the PUBLIC commitments it exposes — `genesisRoot`, `finalRoot`, `chainDigest`, `numTurns`. The light
client sees ONLY these public values + the root proof; it does NOT see the chain's steps or states.
The `leafProofs` / `bindingProof` are the children the engine folded; they live INSIDE the prover and
are reachable to the LIGHT CLIENT only through `RecursiveVerifierSound` (it learns they verify, not
their contents). -/

/-- The succinct aggregate the light client verifies. `root` is the single folded recursion proof;
the four public commitments are exactly the `WholeChainProof` fields. The `leafProofs` are the per-turn
whole-turn proofs and `bindingProof` the chain-binding leaf — folded into `root`. -/

/-! ## 2. The named, realizable soundness hypotheses (the boundary).

These are the three facts the recursion engine supplies that we CANNOT prove in Lean (FRI/recursion
soundness). They are bundled in `EngineSound` as a hypothesis the headline takes — NOT an axiom. The
section variables `CH RH cmb compress compressN` are the §8 commitment portal `HistoryAggregation`
uses; an `Aggregate` is interpreted against a concrete chain `steps` from genesis `g`. -/

/-- **`EngineSound agg g steps`** — the three named recursion-soundness hypotheses, interpreted
against the concrete chain `steps` from genesis `g`. Realizable (§5 exhibits an instance) and
NON-vacuous. -/

  /-- **H-RECURSE (`RecursiveVerifierSound`)** — if the root aggregate verifies, then every child leaf
  AND the binding leaf verify. The recursion engine's in-circuit verifier soundness (the ONE FRI
  obligation, §H1). This is the only hypothesis outside Lean's reach. -/
  recursive_sound : verify agg.root = true →
    (∀ p ∈ agg.leafProofs, verify p = true) ∧ verify agg.bindingProof = true
  /-- **H-LEAF (`InnerProofSound`)** — the leaf proofs are PAIRED POSITIONALLY with the chain steps
  (`Forall₂` ⇒ same length, same order — the binding that defeats leg-swap/drop), and each verifying
  leaf proof attests ITS paired step's verified-executor transition `recCexec pre turn = some post`.
  The EffectVm/descriptor circuit⟺executor soundness, lifted to the leaf boundary. The positional
  pairing is load-bearing: a leaf is bound to its OWN step, so a proof of turn `j` cannot satisfy the
  `i`-th leaf. -/

  tooth over the whole chain (`ChainBound`), AND pins the public genesis/final roots to the chain's
  endpoints. The chain-binding AIR's in-circuit soundness. -/
  binding_sound : verify agg.bindingProof = true →

          | some s => ChainStep.oldRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s)
      ∧ agg.finalRoot = foldedFinalRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN g steps

/-! ## 3. THE LIGHT-CLIENT HEADLINE — verifying the aggregate attests the WHOLE history.

The light client runs `verify agg.root` and NOTHING ELSE. We prove: if that one check passes (and the
engine is sound, the named hypotheses), then EVERY turn in the history executed correctly, the chain
is correctly ordered, and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. No re-witnessing. -/

/-- Helper: from a positional pairing `Forall₂ (fun p s => verify p → executed s) ps ss` and the
fact that ALL paired proofs verify, every step executed. Induction on the `Forall₂` witness with the
"all verify" premise generalized. -/

    · exact ih (fun q hq => hall q (List.mem_cons_of_mem p hq)) a hrest

/-- **`every_leaf_verifies_implies_executed`.** From the recursion-soundness + leaf-soundness
hypotheses, a verifying root implies every step's verified-executor transition holds. The chain of
in-circuit verifications collapses to "every turn executed correctly" — `recursive_sound` (root ⇒
leaves verify) composed with `leaf_sound` (positional pairing ⇒ each step executed). -/

  obtain ⟨hleaves, _hbind⟩ := es.recursive_sound hroot
  exact forall₂_all_verify_executed Proof verify es.leaf_sound hleaves

/-- **`AggregateAttests agg g steps`** — the full attestation the light client obtains: every turn
executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered, the whole chain is a verified-executor `Run` from
genesis, and the public roots are pinned to the genuine endpoints. This is `WellFormedChain`'s
content, delivered to a client that checked ONLY the succinct root. -/

/-- **`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (THE MAGNESIUM→GOLD HEADLINE).**

A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) obtains
`AggregateAttests`: every turn executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered (no reorder/drop/
insert), and the public final root is the genuine fold of the whole history — UNDER the named,
realizable engine-soundness hypotheses. The verification of the succinct aggregate IS the trust in
the whole history; proofs are additive attestation, and this theorem is exactly that statement,
gap-free. -/

    (agg : Aggregate Proof) (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep)
    (es : EngineSound Proof verify CH RH cmb compress compressN agg g steps)

    , ordered := hbound
    , final_is_genuine_fold := hfin
    , genesis_pinned := hgen }

/-! ## 4. The RUN + CONSERVATION the light client inherits (no re-execution).

`AggregateAttests` gives the per-step executor transitions + the ordering; composed with state-level
continuity (the strong form the root tooth recovers under CR, `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_-
state`), it yields a full `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis, hence conservation over the WHOLE
history — all WITHOUT the light client re-running a single turn. We expose the run + conservation
directly from the `StateChained` witness the prover supplies (the chain's executor genuineness), which
the aggregate attests is consistent with the verified leaves. -/

/-- **`attested_history_is_run`.** Given the executor-genuine chain (`StateChained` — the
prover's witness that the steps are a real run, which the verifying leaves attest step-by-step), the
whole attested history is a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis to the folded endpoint. The light
client inherits every run-level theorem of the verified record cell.

NOTE (the run vs conservation split): a full `Run recChainedSystem` is a relation on `RecChainedState`
configs, so composing the steps requires the receipt LOG to chain (`s.post = s'.pre`), which the §8
state commitment does NOT bind (it commits the kernel, not the log). The full `Run` therefore genuinely
needs `StateChained`. CONSERVATION, by contrast, reads only the kernel — so it is derivable from the
VERIFIED root without `StateChained`; that is `conserves_from_verification` below (the CRITICAL-3
closure). The log being uncommitted is the exact, named residual: it blocks the full RUN, never
conservation. -/
theorem attested_history_is_run
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    Run recChainedSystem g (lastStateOf g steps) :=
  wellformed_is_run g steps hch

/-- **`attested_history_conserves` (KEYSTONE).** Value is conserved across the WHOLE attested
history: the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total. A light client trusting the
aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history of arbitrary length, having re-executed nothing. Rides
`HistoryAggregation.wellformed_history_conserves`.

This form takes `StateChained` as a hypothesis (the legitimate producer-supplied path —
`Argus/Aggregate.lean` DERIVES `StateChained` from the genuine producer run). The verification-derived
form that needs NO such hypothesis is `conserves_from_verification` below. -/
theorem attested_history_conserves
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    recTotal (lastStateOf g steps).kernel = recTotal g.kernel :=
  wellformed_history_conserves g steps hch

/-! ### CRITICAL-3 CLOSURE — conservation-over-history DERIVED from `verify agg.root`, no `StateChained`.

The critique: `attested_history_conserves` takes `StateChained` (state continuity) as a SEPARATE
prover-supplied hypothesis — exactly what a malicious prover controls — and the tool that could close
it (`root_tooth_pins_state`) recovered only commitment-equality, not state-equality. We close it:
the strengthened `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_kernel` recovers KERNEL-equality from the verified
root tooth (under the standard Poseidon CR set + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant), and
`verified_history_conserves` rides that to conservation through `KernelChained` — so conservation
follows from `verify agg.root` itself (which delivers the `ChainBound` tooth via `AggregateAttests`),
plus the genesis pin + the non-cryptographic structural envelope `SeamStruct`. The `StateChained`
hypothesis is GONE from the conservation headline. -/

/-- **`conserves_from_verification` (THE CRITICAL-3 HEADLINE — conservation from `verify agg.root`).**
A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) learns the WHOLE
history conserves value — the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total — with NO
`StateChained` hypothesis. The verified root gives `AggregateAttests` (hence the `ChainBound` root
tooth); under the standard Poseidon CR set + the genesis pin + the structural envelope `SeamStruct`
(matched turns + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant, both non-cryptographic, neither a
state-continuity assertion), `verified_history_conserves` DERIVES kernel continuity from that tooth
(`root_tooth_pins_kernel`) and rides it to conservation. This is the exact gap the critique flagged,
closed: "trusting the aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history" now follows from VERIFICATION, not
from the prover's honesty about state continuity. (The receipt LOG — the one `RecChainedState`
component the §8 root does not bind — blocks only the full `Run`, never conservation; named, not
hidden.) -/

/-! ## 5. NON-VACUITY — the named hypotheses are REALIZABLE (witnessed BOTH ways).

The headline would be hollow if `EngineSound` were unsatisfiable, or if `verify agg.root = true`
could not occur. We exhibit a CONCRETE realizing instance over the `HistoryAggregation.honestStep`
chain (a real 1-step executor run over the teeth genesis): a `verify` that accepts, an `Aggregate`
whose root/leaf/binding all verify, and an `EngineSound` proof — so the headline fires on a real
chain and concludes a real `AggregateAttests`. We ALSO witness the negative: a `verify` that REJECTS
gives a vacuously-true `EngineSound` (no obligation), and the headline is not invoked — the tooth is
in the `binding_sound`/`leaf_sound` implications, which §6 shows separate honest from
tampered. -/

/-! ## 6. THE ANTI-GHOST TOOTH — the named hypotheses REJECT a tampered aggregate.

Additive attestation is only meaningful if the aggregate cannot attest a BROKEN history. The teeth:
(a) the binding soundness CANNOT certify a reordered chain — if the steps' seam roots disagree,
`ChainBound` is FALSE, so any `EngineSound` whose `binding_sound` fires on such a chain is
CONTRADICTORY (you cannot have a verifying binding proof for a broken order). (b) the leaf↔step
PAIRING (`leaf_sound`'s length+index discipline) defeats leg-swap/drop: a leaf proof is bound to its
OWN step's `(pre, turn, post)`, so you cannot verify proof-of-turn-j against step-i. -/

/-- **`tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` (THE ANTI-GHOST TOOTH).** No sound aggregate can
attest a REORDERED 2-step chain. If the first step's `newRoot` differs from the second's `oldRoot`
(a spliced/reordered/dropped turn — the `TurnChainError::ChainBreak` condition), then for ANY engine
whose binding leaf verifies, `binding_sound` would force `ChainBound [s, s']`, which is FALSE for a
broken order. Hence the engine cannot have a verifying binding proof over a tampered chain — the
aggregate REJECTS reorder/drop/insert. -/

/-- **`leaf_pairing_defeats_swap` (the leg-swap tooth).** A verifying leaf proof attests the
transition of ITS OWN POSITIONALLY-PAIRED step, not some other turn's. The `leaf_sound` `Forall₂`
binds the head leaf `p` to the head step `s`: if `p` verifies, the executor ran `s`'s
`(pre, turn) ↦ post`. An adversary cannot satisfy the head leaf by supplying a proof of a DIFFERENT
turn while exporting `s`'s roots — the leaf is bound to `s` by the positional pairing, not re-pointable.
This is the recursion analog of the per-effect anti-ghost. -/
