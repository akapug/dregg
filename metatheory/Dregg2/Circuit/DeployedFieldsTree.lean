# `DeployedFieldsTree` — the native 8-felt user-field-MAP tree spine (Phase H-FIELDS-8).

The THIRD and LAST faithful root's Lean spine, the exact twin of `DeployedHeapTree`'s `Heap8Scheme`
(and of `DeployedCapTree`'s `Cap8Scheme`). The deployed fields tree is a sorted-Poseidon2 binary
Merkle map over LINKED IMT leaves `(addr, value, nextAddr)` (`addr = openable_fields_root::
field_key_hash key`, `value = fold_bytes32 v`, `nextAddr` = the gap-#5 IMT pointer to the next-larger
present address) — the SAME `HeapLeaf` / `node8` scheme `heap_root.rs::compute_canonical_heap_root_8`
folds, over the `fields_root_leaves` set. The historical commitment projected each node/leaf to a SINGLE
felt (`hash : List ℤ → ℤ`, ~2^31), well below the deployed FRI/STARK ~124-bit soundness floor: two
genuinely-different field maps can collide on the 1-felt root while topping different 8-felt roots (the
fields GENTIAN tooth `circuit/tests/fields_root_gentian_weld.rs` exhibits a concrete pair). This module
gives the FAITHFUL 8-felt fields tree — every node absorbs full 8-felt children through the arity-16
`node8` chip and emits a full 8-felt digest.

⚑ **THE `chip8CR` FIELD IS GONE (2026-07-20), AND THE STRUCTURE IS NOW INHABITED.** `Fields8Scheme` used
to carry `chip8CR : Compress8CR chipAbsorb8` as a FIELD — injectivity of a map that squeezes the
infinite `List ℤ` into 8 bounded BabyBear lanes. `VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear` refutes
that for ANY function of that shape, the deployed chip included, so NO deployed `Fields8Scheme` value
could be constructed and every theorem of the form `∀ S8 : Fields8Scheme, …` was VACUOUS. §F.D below
exhibits `deployedFields8Scheme`, a real value whose OWN chip the teeth refute. The binding the tree
used to ASSUME is now EXTRACTED AS DATA: see `DeployedCapTree.Coll8` and the `…_binds_or_collides`
family.

REUSE (the Option-A payoff, exactly as for cap and heap): the membership-recompose anti-ghost spine is
digest-type-AGNOSTIC and already proved once — `CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeGFind`/`recomposeGFind_spec`,
the TOTAL-FUNCTION peel — so the fields tree instantiates it rather than re-authoring a parallel copy.
`Digest8`, `Compress8CR`, `Coll8`, and `pack8`/`pack8_inj` are shared verbatim from `DeployedCapTree` —
cap/heap/fields all ride the ONE `node8` compression (`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes` at
`CHIP_NODE8_ARITY = 16`), which is also why §F.D's inhabitant rides the SAME deployed-shaped chip the
cap and heap inhabitants do.

lanes). BOTH the leaf (`fieldsLeafDigest8`, arity 3 — the IMT `[addr, value, nextAddr]`) and the node
(`fieldsNodeOf8`, arity 16) ride it; the input lists are length-disjoint (3 vs 16), so the chip's
per-row `(arity, padded inputs)` seeding separates the two domains for free. The exact twin of
`DeployedHeapTree.Heap8Scheme` — indeed the SAME carrier (one `node8` chip serves cap/heap/fields).

/-! ### §F.X — BINDING, EXTRACTED AS DATA (the sound replacement for the deleted injectivity family).

The four theorems this section replaces — `fieldsLeafDigest8_injective`, `fieldsNodeOf8_injective`,
`recomposeUp8_inj_of_path`, `membersAt8_functional_on_path` — were ALL discharged from the `chip8CR`
FIELD, i.e. from `Compress8CR chipAbsorb8`, which the deployed chip refutes. They are DELETED, not kept
beside the new forms: keeping them is what would make this regrounding additive and therefore inert.

Each is replaced by a TOTAL EXTRACTOR plus a theorem that what it returns is a genuine collision. The
conclusions are disjunctions `binding ∨ Coll8 chipAbsorb8 (the pair the extractor returned)`. As
FORMULAS they are weaker than the equalities they replace; as CONTENT AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS they are
strictly stronger, because the deleted premise is unsatisfiable by the real chip — the old theorems
said nothing about the deployed system, and these hold OF it. §F.S proves that relation both ways. -/

This is what the 8-felt migration actually buys, stated honestly: the lane-0 forge the GENTIAN tooth
exhibits (`circuit/tests/fields_root_gentian_weld.rs` — different entries, same 1-felt projection) is
excluded UNLESS the adversary produces a full ~124-bit collision at a NAMED pair of arity-16 blocks. The

/-! ### §F.S — THE STRENGTH RELATION, both directions (no strength lost; no free pass gained).

Deleting a carrier and restating its consumers as disjunctions invites two fair objections, both
answered here in Lean rather than in prose.

1. *"You weakened the theorems to make the deletion easy."* — the `…_of_injective` bridges assume
   exactly the injectivity the deleted field asserted, and each deleted theorem falls straight out.
   They are precisely the injective special case of the new ones.
2. *"The right disjunct is a free pass, so the disjunction says nothing."* —
   `fieldsOpenColl_refutable_of_injective` shows the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE: at an injective
   chip the extracted pair is NOT a collision, so the binding half has to do the work.

These are STANDALONE bridges, deliberately NOT hypotheses on any deployed keystone: `Compress8CR` is
FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, so a keystone carrying it would be right back where this repair
started. (The refutability core `coll8_refutable_of_injective` is shared verbatim from the cap tree —
`Coll8` is one predicate, not three.) -/

/-! ### §F.D — ⚑ THE ACCEPTANCE TEST: a REAL DEPLOYED `Fields8Scheme` VALUE.

The whole point of deleting the `chip8CR` field is measured HERE, not by a green build. With the field
present, `Fields8Scheme` had no deployed inhabitant (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear`
refutes the field for any function landing in bounded BabyBear lanes, which the deployed chip does), so
every `∀ S8 : Fields8Scheme, …` theorem — the entire fields-open surface — was vacuously true.

`deployedFields8Scheme` below is a VALUE, and it rides the SAME `deployedShapedChip8` the cap and heap
inhabitants do — which is not a shortcut but the FAITHFUL modelling choice: one `node8` chip
(`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes` at arity 16) serves cap, heap, AND fields in the deployment.
Its chip squeezes an arbitrary-length `List ℤ` into eight lanes each reduced into `[0, p)` for the
deployed BabyBear prime, and decisively its own chip REFUTES the deleted field
(`VacuitySweepTeeth.deployedFields8Scheme_chip_not_Compress8CR`). That is the tightest statement of what
changed: **the very function the teeth refute now INHABITS the structure.**

⚑ Honest scope: this is not a KAT-faithful Poseidon2 model (none exists in Lean here), so it is not a
byte-differential against the Rust chip. It is a deployed-SHAPED inhabitant, and shape is precisely what
the vacuity argument was about. -/
