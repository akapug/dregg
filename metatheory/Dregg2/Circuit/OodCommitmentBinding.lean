# Dregg2.Circuit.OodCommitmentBinding — STARK-FLOOR REDUCTION 3: `hood.b` reduced to `Poseidon2SpongeCR`.

**What this closes.** `FieldIntegerLift.OodInterpF.hood` (the per-constraint OOD identity
`(constraintPoly d t c).eval ζ = Zp.eval ζ · (qp c).eval ζ`) bundles THREE sub-obligations
(`docs/SUPERSEDED/STARK-FLOOR-REDUCTION.md §1`):

  * (a) RLC de-batching — Schwartz–Zippel, no assumption [handled by the RLC lane];
  * (b) **commitment-opening binding** — the value `verifyAlgo` OPENS at ζ (`TableOpening.constraintEval`)
        genuinely equals the COMMITTED constraint polynomial evaluated at ζ, i.e. the Merkle/FRI opening
        BINDS — a prover cannot open the commitment to a different value [THIS FILE];
  * (c) FRI low-degreeness — the genuine hard floor [later].

Sub-obligation (b) is NOT algebra: it is a hash-binding fact. This module REDUCES it to the ONE named
hash floor `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (`Dregg2/Circuit/Poseidon2Binding.lean`, a `Prop` HYPOTHESIS, never an
`axiom`) — the SAME floor `AggAirSound.combine_digest_binds` (the CR tooth) and `FriVerifier`'s
`merkleRecompute_binds` rest on. After this, `hood.b` is a legitimately-named crypto assumption (same
status as the PQ apex's hash/lattice floors), NOT a bare `hood` premise.

## The reduction (a break ⟹ a Poseidon2 collision)

`TableOpening.constraintEval` is delivered to the verifier by a Poseidon2 Merkle opening: the opened
leaf (the field value) is recomputed up its sibling path (`FriVerifier.merkleRecompute`, the
`MerkleTreeMmcs` opening — each node hashes two child digests, order fixed by the index bit) and
compared to the committed root. We model the node hash as the ordered two-felt Poseidon2 sponge
`sponge [l, r]` — the EXACT binary specialization whose collision-resistance is `Poseidon2SpongeCR`,
identical to `AggAirSound.Hsponge`.

  * **`merkleRecomputeZ_binds`** (mirrors `FriVerifier.merkleRecompute_binds`) — under
    `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, two leaves that recompute the SAME root at the SAME query index over the SAME
    sibling path are EQUAL. Proven by induction on the path; the ONLY crypto reliance is that each node
    hash `sponge [·, ·]` is injective, which is `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (`injection` splits `[a,b]=[a',b']`).
  * **`commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR`** (THE `hood.b` REDUCTION) — under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`,
    an opened value `vOpened` and the honest committed value `vCommitted := (constraintPoly d t c).eval ζ`
    that BOTH recompute to the same committed root ARE EQUAL: the opened `constraintEval` is BOUND to the
    committed polynomial's evaluation. An adversary opening a DIFFERENT value forces two distinct leaves
    to the same root — a Poseidon2 collision (`opening_equivocation_breaks_cr`: a break ⟹ `¬
    Poseidon2SpongeCR`). This is the honest floor, not a re-assumed `hood.b`.

Anti-ghost, witnessed BOTH ways: on the injective toy sponge (`Poseidon2Binding.Reference.refSponge`,
CR-discharged) an honest opening BINDS (`honest_opening_binds`); on a NON-injective sponge
(constant-zero) an adversary equivocates two distinct values to the same root, and that equivocation
IS a witnessed collision (`constant_sponge_equivocates` — the CR floor is load-bearing, not vacuous).

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is a Prop
hypothesis where used, never an `axiom`. Imported into `Dregg2.lean` (transitively, via `StarkSoundFriLdt`/`AlgoStarkSoundTransferV3`, which CONSUME `commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR` on the deployed soundness path).

## Remaining wire to `OodInterpF.hood`

The standalone binding is proven green. To land it INTO `OodInterpF.hood` for the deployed verifier one
supplies three deployment-plumbing facts (the same "unmodeled commitment/column layout" residual the doc
names, NOT new crypto): (i) the committed root of the constraint-poly commitment and that
`verifyAlgo`'s accepted opening (`OodQuotientConsistency.verifyAlgo_accept_forces_table_identity` ties
`topen.constraintEval` to `A.mul vanishingAtZeta quotientAtZeta`) recomputes to it via `merkleRecomputeZ`;
(ii) the honest committed leaf equals `(constraintPoly d t c).eval ζ` cast to the leaf felt; (iii) the
BabyBear→ℤ canonical-representative bridge (the same one `FieldIntegerLift` carries). Given those,
`commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR` yields `topen.constraintEval = (constraintPoly d t c).eval ζ` —
`hood.b`, now DERIVED FROM `Poseidon2SpongeCR`.

/-! ## §1 — the ordered two-felt Merkle node hash (the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` binary specialization).

A Poseidon2 `MerkleTreeMmcs` node hashes two child digests into the parent; the index bit fixes the
order (even ⇒ `acc` on the left). We model the multi-lane digest as a single felt over the list-sponge
`sponge`, so a node hash is `sponge [l, r]` — the EXACT binary specialization of the sponge whose
collision-resistance is `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (identical to `AggAirSound.Hsponge`). -/

/-- Scalar-digest Merkle-path recompute: fold the opened `leaf` (a single felt) up through the
`siblings`, hashing two child digests per level with the ordered node hash `sponge [·, ·]`, branching on
the index bit exactly as `FriVerifier.merkleRecompute` does. Structural recursion on `siblings`. -/

/-- **`merkleRecomputeZ_binds` (THE ANTI-FORGERY TOOTH).** Under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, two leaves that
recompute the SAME root at the SAME query index over the SAME sibling path are EQUAL — an attacker
cannot open a Merkle query to a forged value. Proven by induction on the path; rests ONLY on the named
sponge CR (each node hash `sponge [·, ·]` is injective, `injection` splits `[a,b] = [a',b']`). This is
`FriVerifier.merkleRecompute_binds` over the scalar-digest sponge, grounded on the named floor. -/

/-- **`commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR` (THE `hood.b` REDUCTION).** Under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`,
the value `verifyAlgo` opens at ζ (`vOpened`, the `TableOpening.constraintEval`) and the honest
committed value `vCommitted` (intended `(constraintPoly d t c).eval ζ`) that BOTH recompute to the same
committed Merkle root `root` at the same query index over the same sibling path ARE EQUAL. So the opened
`constraintEval` is BOUND to the committed polynomial's evaluation at ζ — a prover cannot open the
commitment to a different value. The ONLY crypto reliance is the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor; this
is `hood.b` DERIVED, not re-assumed. -/

/-- **`opening_equivocation_breaks_cr` (A BREAK ⟹ A POSEIDON2 COLLISION).** If a prover opens the SAME
committed root at the SAME query to TWO DISTINCT values (`vOpened ≠ vCommitted`), it witnesses that the
sponge is NOT collision-resistant — `¬ Poseidon2SpongeCR`. This is the load-bearing role of the Merkle
commitment: equivocating the opened `constraintEval` after ζ is fixed is EXACTLY a Poseidon2 collision.
So `hood.b` bottoms out at the hash floor and nothing weaker. -/

  hne (commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR sponge hCR hCommitted hOpened)

/-! ## §4 — NON-VACUITY: honest openings BIND, and the CR floor is LOAD-BEARING.

The reduction would be hollow if no opening ever bound, or if it bound even without CR. We exhibit BOTH:
on the injective toy sponge (`Poseidon2Binding.Reference.refSponge`, CR-discharged) an honest opening
binds; on a NON-injective sponge (constant-zero) an adversary equivocates two DISTINCT values to the
same root — a witnessed collision showing the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis is genuinely required. -/

DISTINCT leaves (`1 ≠ 2`) recompute the SAME root (`0`) over a one-level path — an equivocation. By
`opening_equivocation_breaks_cr` this is a witnessed failure of collision-resistance: `¬
Poseidon2SpongeCR zSponge`. Without the CR hypothesis the binding is FALSE, so the floor is real, not
vacuous — exactly the `OodQuotientConsistency.ood_exceptional_escape` role for `hnonexc`. -/
