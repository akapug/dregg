# Dregg2.Circuit.MapMerkleRoot — the DEPLOYED depth-16 binary-Merkle map root (the faithful map-op commitment).

## What this closes (deliverable 2 — the last real denotation gap)

`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`/`writesTo` (the `MapOp.holdsAt` legs for nullifiers / cells / commitments)
denoted a FLAT SPONGE `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)` — a single sponge over
the sorted leaf list. The DEPLOYED map-op (`circuit/src/heap_root.rs`, `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`
`Ir2Air::MapOps`) commits a **depth-`d` BINARY MERKLE** root instead:

    leaf = hash[addr, value]                       -- ⚠ the PRE-IMT leaf (see below)
    node = hash[left, right]                       -- arity-2 `hash_fact(l, [r])` (the `mix` fold)
    root = the perfect binary fold of the (padded) sorted leaf-digest list, depth `HEAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`

⚠ ARITY NOTE (gap-#5 IMT, 2026-07): the DEPLOYED `HeapLeaf::digest`/`digest8` is now the LINKED
arity-3 `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` (`IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash`). The FAITHFUL 8-felt §5b
section below models exactly that (`linkHeap` + the arity-3 `heapLeafDigest8`). The SCALAR §2-§5
model in THIS section still folds the historical arity-2 `leafOf` — it is the lane-0/1-felt
DENOTATION layer (`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`/`writesTo`), a NAMED residue of the IMT cutover: its
`writesTo` describes the pre-IMT leaf function, pending the denotation rewire onto `ImtLeaf`.

This module models EXACTLY that binary fold (`mapNode`/`foldLevel`/`perfectRoot`) and proves it
INJECTIVE on the padded leaf-digest vector under the single named Poseidon2-CR floor
(`mapNode_injective` — the `hash[l,r]` 2-to-1 node CR — composed up the depth-`d` perfect tree by
`perfectRoot_injective`). `DescriptorIR2` re-defines `opensTo`/`writesTo` over THIS root (dropping the
flat-sponge `Heap.root`), so `MapOp.holdsAt` — a leg of the deployed `Satisfied2` — denotes the genuine
depth-16 binary-Merkle opening, and the anti-ghost `opensTo_functional`/`writesTo_functional` re-prove
against `perfectRoot_injective` (the binary-tree analog of `Heap.root_injective`), NOT the sponge.

## The model (faithful to `heap_root.rs`)

The deployed `CanonicalHeapTree` pads the sorted leaf list to `2^d` positions with the MIN/MAX
sentinels, then folds bottom-up by `hash_fact(l, [r])`. We model the COMMITMENT of a sorted heap as
`mapRoot hash h := perfectRoot hash d (padDigests d (h.map (leafOf hash)))`: the leaf digests of the
sorted entries, padded to `2^d` with a fixed sentinel digest, folded up the perfect tree. The sorted
discipline (`SortedKeys`) keeps the entry list canonical, so the heap MEANING (`Heap.get`) is unchanged
— only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge to the binary fold. The named CR floor is the
SAME `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, now used at the 2-to-1 node (`mapNode`) and the leaf (`leafOf`).

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. Crypto
enters ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (at the node + leaf), the SAME floor the whole
commitment tower carries. NEW file; imports read-only.

The sorted heap (`Heap.FeltHeap`, the abstract map MEANING) is committed by folding its leaf-digest list
through the depth-`d` perfect binary tree — the deployed `CanonicalHeapTree::root`. The heap MEANING
(`Heap.get`/`Heap.SortedKeys`) is UNCHANGED; only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge
(`Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)`) to this binary fold. The deployment pins every heap as the
fixed-depth `2^d`-leaf padded vector; the `RootedAt` relation below carries that `length = 2^d`
discipline so the root BINDS the heap (`mapRoot_injective`). -/

/-! ## §5b — THE FAITHFUL 8-felt map denotation (Phase H-HEAP-8): the perfect-tree fold + opening over
`node8` (`Digest8`), the exact twin of §2–§5 but at the deployed ~124-bit width. The historical §2–§5
folded a SINGLE felt per node (`mapNode hash : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ`, ~2^31, below the FRI/STARK ~124-bit floor); the
GENTIAN tooth exhibits a colliding-lane-0 heap pair. This section commits the FULL 8-felt root: nodes ride
`Heap8Scheme.heapNodeOf8` (arity-16 `node8` chip) and leaves `heapLeafDigest8` (`DeployedHeapTree`), NOT
the 1-felt sponge. `MapOp.holdsAt`'s deployed denotation moves onto `opensToMerkle8` / `writesToMerkle8`.

⚑ **BINDING IS EXTRACTED AS DATA, NOT ASSUMED (2026-07-20).** This cascade used to be discharged from
`heapNodeOf8_injective` / `heapLeafDigest8_injective`, which rode the `Heap8Scheme.chip8CR` FIELD —
`Compress8CR chipAbsorb8`, which the deployed chip REFUTES (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear`)
and which therefore made `Heap8Scheme` uninhabitable and this whole section VACUOUS. The field is deleted;
every equality below is now a DISJUNCTION `binding ∨ Coll8 chipAbsorb8 (the pair a TOTAL extractor
returned)`. The extractors mirror the proofs exactly: `foldLevel8Find` scans one Merkle level pairwise,
`perfectRoot8Find` descends the levels, `mapLeaf8Find` scans the leaf vector, and `mapRoot8Find` resolves
the two possible collision sites (node vs leaf) into ONE named pair. §5b.S recovers every deleted
statement as the injective special case, so no strength was lost. -/

Deliberately NOT `∃ a b, chip collides`: at deployed BabyBear parameters that existence claim is
UNCONDITIONALLY TRUE by pigeonhole (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear` proves precisely it),

/-! ### §5b.E — the OPENING-LEVEL consumers, over EXPLICIT witness heaps.

`opensToMerkle8` / `writesToMerkle8` hide their heap behind an existential, so the pair a collision
extractor returns is a function of the WITNESSES, not of the statement's visible parameters. Restating
the conclusion as `… ∨ ∃ collision` would be exactly the free pass this repair exists to avoid
(pigeonhole makes it unconditionally true). So the honest form takes the two witness heaps EXPLICITLY
and names `MapRootColl S8 d m₁ m₂` — the specific pair, extracted from the specific witnesses. The
existential-level statements survive as the injective special cases in §5b.S. -/

/-! ### §5b.S — THE STRENGTH RELATION, both directions (no strength lost; no free pass gained).

The `…_of_injective` bridges assume exactly the injectivity the deleted `Heap8Scheme.chip8CR` field
asserted, and EVERY deleted statement — including the existential-level `opensToMerkle8_functional`,
`opensToMerkle8_some_excludes_none` and `writesToMerkle8_functional` — falls straight out. They are
precisely the injective special case of the new disjunctions. And `mapRootColl_refutable_of_injective`
shows the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE, so it is not a free pass: at an injective chip the binding
half has to do the work.

These are STANDALONE bridges, deliberately NOT hypotheses on any deployed keystone: `Compress8CR` is
FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, so a keystone carrying it would be right back where this repair
started. -/
