# Dregg2.Circuit.MapMerkleRoot — the DEPLOYED depth-16 binary-Merkle map root (the faithful map-op commitment).

## What this closes (deliverable 2 — the last real denotation gap)

`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`/`writesTo` (the `MapOp.holdsAt` legs for nullifiers / cells / commitments)
denoted a FLAT SPONGE `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)` — a single sponge over
the sorted leaf list. The DEPLOYED map-op (`circuit/src/heap_root.rs`, `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`
`Ir2Air::MapOps`) commits a **depth-`d` BINARY MERKLE** root instead:

    leaf = hash[addr, value]                       -- arity-2 `hash_many` (`HeapLeaf::digest`)
    node = hash[left, right]                       -- arity-2 `hash_fact(l, [r])` (the `mix` fold)
    root = the perfect binary fold of the (padded) sorted leaf-digest list, depth `HEAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`

This module models EXACTLY that binary fold (`mapNode`/`foldLevel`/`perfectRoot`) and proves it
INJECTIVE on the padded leaf-digest vector under the single named Poseidon2-CR floor
(`mapNode_injective` — the `hash[l,r]` 2-to-1 node CR — composed up the depth-`d` perfect tree by
`perfectRoot_injective`). `DescriptorIR2` re-defines `opensTo`/`writesTo` over THIS root (dropping the
flat-sponge `Heap.root`), so `MapOp.holdsAt` — a leg of the deployed `Satisfied2` — denotes the genuine
depth-16 binary-Merkle opening, and the anti-ghost `opensTo_functional`/`writesTo_functional` re-prove
against `perfectRoot_injective` (the binary-tree analog of `Heap.root_injective`), NOT the sponge.

## The model (faithful to `heap_root.rs`)

The deployed `CanonicalHeapTree` pads the sorted leaf list to `2^d` positions with the MIN/MAX
sentinels, then folds bottom-up by `hash_fact(l, [r])`. We model the COMMITMENT of a sorted heap as
`mapRoot hash h := perfectRoot hash d (padDigests d (h.map (leafOf hash)))`: the leaf digests of the
sorted entries, padded to `2^d` with a fixed sentinel digest, folded up the perfect tree. The sorted
discipline (`SortedKeys`) keeps the entry list canonical, so the heap MEANING (`Heap.get`) is unchanged
— only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge to the binary fold. The named CR floor is the
SAME `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, now used at the 2-to-1 node (`mapNode`) and the leaf (`leafOf`).

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. Crypto
enters ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (at the node + leaf), the SAME floor the whole
commitment tower carries. NEW file; imports read-only.

(`Heap.get`/`Heap.SortedKeys`) is UNCHANGED; only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge
(`Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)`) to this binary fold. The deployment pins every heap as the
fixed-depth `2^d`-leaf padded vector; the `RootedAt` relation below carries that `length = 2^d`
discipline so the root BINDS the heap (`mapRoot_injective`). -/
