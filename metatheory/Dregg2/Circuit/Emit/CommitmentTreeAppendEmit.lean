# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CommitmentTreeAppendEmit — the DEPLOYED note-tree accumulator root,
  COMPUTED IN LEAN over the REAL BabyBear Poseidon2 (not the opaque `H` stand-in).

## What this module delivers (and why it is NOT an `EffectVmDescriptor2`)

Chunk 1 (`Dregg2.Circuit.CommitmentTreeAccumulator`) authored the deployed 4-ary append-only
Poseidon2 note-commitment tree — `nodeAt`/`root`/`append`/`emptyHash` — over an OPAQUE node
compression `H : List ℤ → ℤ`, with the honest collision-extraction binding
(`root_distinct_extracts_collision`) and the incremental-append lemma. That module PROVES the
tree's algebra; it does not compute the deployed BYTES, because `H` is opaque.

This module CLOSES that last gap: it instantiates chunk 1's `root`/`append` at the REAL,
KAT-locked BabyBear Poseidon2-w16 permutation (`Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm`, bit-exact
against the deployed `default_babybear_poseidon2_16().permute`), realizing `hash_4_to_1`
(`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs`) as `hash4to1Real`. The result — `rootReal` — COMPUTES THE DEPLOYED
NOTE-TREE ROOT, byte-for-byte, entirely in Lean. The `#guard` byte-pins below are the EXACT deployed
roots (`Poseidon2MerkleTree::root().0`) for empty/sparse/half/full trees at depths 2–4 and at every
append prefix — the same integers `commit/tests/poseidon2_tree_lean_differential.rs` asserts the
DEPLOYED Rust tree reproduces. Lean `#guard rootReal = golden` ∧ Rust `assert deployed = golden` ⇒
`deployed = rootReal` byte-for-byte: the byte-identical safety gate the cutover requires.

### Why there is no descriptor JSON / `EmitByName` entry here

The other `Emit/*Emit.lean` modules author `EffectVmDescriptor2`s — STARK AIRs that a witness trace
either SATISFIES or not (`Satisfied2`; `prove_vm_descriptor2` takes a caller-supplied `base_trace`).
An AIR descriptor is an ACCEPTOR, not an EVALUATOR: it cannot COMPUTE a tree root from a leaf list.
The deployed precedent confirms this is the intended shape — the sorted-map heap root
(`heap_root.rs::CanonicalHeapTree::root` / `compute_heap_root`) is likewise computed in hand-rolled
Rust, and its Lean-emitted descriptor (`HeapOpenEmit`) only CONSTRAINS the sorted-Merkle write. So
the note-tree ROOT is witness-generation, the analog of `heap_root.rs`'s root computation — it is
legitimately NOT an AIR descriptor, and forcing it into an `EffectVmDescriptor2` shell (an AIR that
computes nothing) would mislabel it. The MEMBERSHIP algebra of the same tree already IS Lean-emitted
(`MerkleMembership4aryEmit` → `merkle-membership-4ary-general.json`, consumed by `circuit::merkle_air`).

This module is the faithful COMPUTED-root author; the differential is the byte-identity proof.

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} (inherited from chunk 1); the byte-pins are
computable `#guard`s over the real permutation (interpreter-evaluated, no `native_decide`), exactly
like the `Poseidon2BabyBearW16` KAT.

/-! ## §0 — `hash4to1Real`: the REAL deployed `hash_4_to_1`, over the KAT-locked permutation.

`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs::hash_4_to_1` sets state `[in0, in1, in2, in3, 4, 0…0]` (rate 0..3 = the
four child hashes; position 4 = the arity domain-separation tag `4`; positions 5..15 = 0), applies
the permutation, and returns lane 0. `stateOf` builds exactly that 16-felt state (child hashes are
canonical BabyBear values in `[0, p)`, read via `Int.toNat`); `hash4to1Real` permutes and reads
lane 0. Bit-exact to the deployed hash by the `Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm` KAT. -/

/-- The 16-felt Poseidon2 state `hash_4_to_1` seeds from a 4-child list (`state[4] = 4` arity tag). -/
def stateOf (xs : List ℤ) : List Nat :=
  [ (xs.getD 0 0).toNat, (xs.getD 1 0).toNat, (xs.getD 2 0).toNat, (xs.getD 3 0).toNat,
    4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

/-- **`hash4to1Real`** — the deployed `hash_4_to_1` realized over the real BabyBear Poseidon2-w16
permutation: seed the arity-tagged state, permute, read lane 0. The node compression the DEPLOYED
note tree uses. -/
def hash4to1Real (xs : List ℤ) : ℤ :=
  ((Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2BabyBearW16.perm (stateOf xs)).getD 0 0 : ℤ)

-- KAT: `hash4to1Real [0,1,2,3]` equals the deployed `hash_4_to_1([0,1,2,3]).0` byte-for-byte
-- (captured from `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs`). If the Lean permutation diverged from the deployed
-- hash, this `#guard` would fail the build.
#guard decide (hash4to1Real [0, 1, 2, 3] = (319108099 : ℤ))

/-! ## §1 — `rootReal`: chunk 1's proven `root`, instantiated at the REAL hash — computes deployed bytes. -/

/-- **`rootReal depth leaves`** — the DEPLOYED note-tree root, computed in Lean: chunk 1's proven
`CommitmentTreeAccumulator.root` at the real `hash4to1Real`. Byte-identical to
`Poseidon2MerkleTree::root().0` (see the `#guard` goldens below and the Rust differential). -/
def rootReal (depth : Nat) (leaves : List ℤ) : ℤ := root hash4to1Real depth leaves

/-- `rootReal` is definitionally chunk 1's `root` at the real hash — so EVERY chunk-1 theorem
(binding, append locality, additivity) holds of the deployed computed object by instantiation. -/

/-! ## §2 — the DEPLOYED-ROOT BYTE-PINS (the golden integers the Rust differential also asserts).

Each `#guard` is `rootReal depth leaves = <deployed Poseidon2MerkleTree::root().0>`. Interpreter-
evaluated over the real permutation (~85 permutations for a depth-4 tree), no `native_decide`. -/

/-! ### Append prefixes at depth 2 (the incremental-accumulator byte-pins).

`append` is genuinely additive (`append_length`); each prefix root is the deployed root after that
many appends. The Rust differential asserts the DEPLOYED tree reproduces these same integers at every
prefix — the incremental path never diverges from the from-scratch build. -/

#guard decide (rootReal 2 (mkSeq 0) = (1354085513 : ℤ))                  -- k = 0
#guard decide (rootReal 2 (append (mkSeq 0) 1) = (1206744973 : ℤ))       -- k = 1

-- append is additive on the pinned prefixes (never idempotent): each append grows the length by one.
#guard decide ((append (mkSeq 4) 5).length = 5)

/-! ## §3 — the HONEST BINDING holds at the REAL deployed hash (no floor assumed).

The chunk-1 collision-extraction reduction, instantiated at `hash4to1Real`: a forged DEPLOYED root
does not presuppose injectivity — it EXHIBITS a genuine `hash_4_to_1` collision. This is what an
adversary who publishes a note-tree root for a tampered commitment sequence must actually clear. -/

/-- **`rootReal_distinct_extracts_collision`** — two leaf sequences that differ inside the tree's
capacity `[0, 4^depth)` yet publish the SAME deployed root EXHIBIT a genuine `hash4to1Real`
(= deployed `hash_4_to_1`) collision. Chunk 1's honest binding, at the real deployed hash. -/
theorem rootReal_distinct_extracts_collision (xs ys : List ℤ) (depth : Nat)
    (hroot : rootReal depth xs = rootReal depth ys)
    (hdiff : ∃ j, j < 4 ^ depth ∧ leafAt xs j ≠ leafAt ys j) :
    ∃ l l' : List ℤ, l ≠ l' ∧ hash4to1Real l = hash4to1Real l' :=
  root_distinct_extracts_collision hash4to1Real xs ys depth hroot hdiff

/-- **`rootReal_append_offpath_unchanged`** — appending at `p = leaves.length` recomputes the deployed
root only along the single root-to-leaf path whose windows contain `p`; every off-path subtree root is
reused. Chunk 1's incremental-append lemma, at the real deployed hash. -/
