# RotatedLayout — the verified column allocator (Phase 1–2 of the verified-snarky foundation)

THE DISEASE (paid for in the revoked-root 178 migration, 2026-07): the rotated-block column layout was
a pile of hand-carried integers spread across ~14 emit files + two byte-identical Rust producers, and
the invariant that makes a layout *legal* — no two things write the same column — was an UNCHECKED
comment. So a flag-day was a 14-file act of faith that plonky3 audited *after* a VK regen instead of the
type system at construction.

THE CURE: make the layout a first-class object with an explicit machine-checked legality witness, whose
`groupCol` projection is the SINGLE SOURCE the emit reads its positions from. A flag-day becomes a new
`def` + `native_decide`; an ill-aligned / overlapping layout becomes UNCONSTRUCTABLE.

`rotated178` is the current geometry. `EffectVmEmitRotationV3` projects its group columns from this
object; `EmitLayoutManifest.lean` emits its `groupTable` to Rust; and both Rust producers plus the
circuit trace generator consume that generated table. The concrete integers therefore live here once.
