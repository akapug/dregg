# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmRotationWideCommitIff — the `⟺` AT EIGHT FELTS, over the object the
executor ACTUALLY CHAINS.

## Why this file exists (the claim-gap it closes)

`977e73b19` moved the consensus anchor onto the CHIP 8-felt commitment: `TurnReceipt::{pre,post}_
state_hash`, the executor signature, and the federation receipt QC body now all carry
`cell/src/commitment.rs::compute_canonical_state_commitment_v9_felt8`, which is
`Faithful8::from_wire_commit_chip (compute_rotated_pre_limbs cell ctx) ctx.iroot` —
i.e. `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:522::wire_commit_8_chip`.

The standing `air_accepts ⟺ spec` family certified a DIFFERENT object. Stated precisely, because the
difference is the whole point:

  * `EffectVmFullStateRunnableComplete.runnable_full_commit_iff` and the seventeen per-tag
    `*_commit_iff` (`EffectVmFullStateTagsA/B`) pin `NEW_COMMIT = wireCommitOfRow hash env`, which is
    `wideCommitOf hash` — a GROUP-4 `H4`-of-`H4` sponge collapsing **13 effect-VM columns to ONE
    felt** (`BALANCE_LO`, `BALANCE_HI`, `NONCE`, `FIELD_BASE+0..7`, `CAP_ROOT`, `sysRootsDigestCol`).
  * The deployed anchor is `wireCommitR8` — a chained **8-felt** absorption over the **178 ROTATED
    pre-iroot limbs** plus the iroot, on the rotated block layout.

These are not the same commitment at two widths; they are two different commitments over two
different column sets. So "lift the seventeen to 8 felts" would have produced an 8-felt version of an
object the consensus path no longer carries. What actually closes the gap is the `⟺` for the ROTATED
WIDE block — `EffectVmEmitRotationWide`, the lane that models `trace_rotated.rs::fill_wide_block` —
which held the SOUNDNESS half (`rotV3WidePin`) and had no completeness half at all. This file
supplies the missing `←` and welds the biconditional.

## ⚑ THE REALITY GATE: which Lean object is the CHIP form, and how it was confirmed

The deployed chain has a byte-twin that DIVERGES from it — `rotation_witness.rs:370`'s plain
`Faithful8::from_wire_commit` over `single_perm_compress`, which seeds NO arity tag (its head leaves
`st[4] = 0` where the chip seeds `st[4] = 4`), so the two chains differ from the head on. The theorem
below must be about the CHIP chain. It is, and here is the confirmation, which is structural rather
than asserted:

  1. `wireCommitR8 permW l ir` is ABSTRACT in `permW : List ℤ → List ℤ`. The chip-vs-plain question
     is therefore entirely a question of WHICH `permW` the surrounding theorem binds.
  2. The wide site's lookup tuple is `chipLookupTupleN ins digestCols =
     (.const ins.length) :: padToE CHIP_RATE ins ++ digestCols.map .var`
     (`DescriptorIR2.lean:1220`). The FIRST tuple element is the **arity tag `ins.length`**, and
     `ChipTableSoundN permW tbl` forces every table row to be `chipRowN permW ins =
     (ins.length : ℤ) :: padTo CHIP_RATE ins ++ permW ins`. So the `permW` these theorems bind is
     the arity-TAGGED absorb — `chip_absorb_all_lanes(arity, ins)` with `arity = ins.length` — which
     is exactly the chip. The untagged `single_perm_compress` has no such tag and cannot realize
     `ChipTableSoundN` against an arity-carrying tuple.
  3. The arity at every step of the deployed chain IS its input length, so `arity = ins.length` is
     not an approximation of the chip but the chip itself: `wire_commit_8_chip` seeds
     `chip_absorb_all_lanes(4, l0..l3)` (head, 4 inputs), `chip_absorb_all_lanes(11, d8 ‖ 3 limbs)`
     (body, 11 inputs), `chip_absorb_all_lanes(9, d8 ‖ 1 limb)` (leftover, 9 inputs), and
     `chip_absorb_all_lanes(11, d8 ‖ iroot ‖ 0 ‖ 0)` (final, 11 inputs).
  4. The SHAPE matches step for step. `rotV3WideSpecs` emits head `[l0,l1,l2,l3]` → carrier 0, then
     58 body groups `(carrier ‖ 3 limbs)` (11 inputs), then the final
     `(carrier 58 ‖ iroot ‖ .const 0 ‖ .const 0)` (11 inputs) → carrier 59; `wireCommitR8` folds
     `chainFrom8 permW (permW (l.take 4)) (chunk31 (l.drop 4) ++ [[ir,0,0]])`, and at `l.length =
     178` the body is `chunk31` of 174 limbs = 58 groups of three with NO leftover — 60 carriers,
     matching `wideNumCarriers = 60` and Rust's `WIDE_NUM_CARRIERS`. `chunk31`'s leftover arm emits
     SINGLETONS (`[a,b] => [[a],[b]]`), which is Rust's `else` arm taking ONE limb (arity 9) — never
     a pair — so the correspondence is faithful at limb counts off the deployed 178 too.

So: the object certified below is `wireCommitR8` under an arity-tagged `ChipTableSoundN permW`, over
the 178 rotated limbs — the chip chain, not the plain chain.

## What is proved

  * `WideChain8` — the row's sixty 8-column carrier blocks hold the genuine per-site absorption.
  * `wideChipTableOf` / `wideChipTableOf_sound` — the chip table a PROVER BUILDS for this row (the
    sixty genuine rows it needs), proved `ChipTableSoundN`. No new floor is assumed: completeness
    exhibits a table rather than positing one that contains every genuine row.
  * `rotV3Wide_commit_iff8` — **THE BICONDITIONAL AT EIGHT FELTS**: the sixty wide lookups hold IFF
    the carriers are the genuine chain AND the state-commit carrier is `wireCommitR8` of the row's
    own 178 limbs and iroot. `→` is the deployed pin (`rotV3WidePin`, unchanged); `←` is the
    constructed witness. `rotV3Wide_commit_iff8_of_table` is the table-parametric form.
  * `rotV3Wide_commit8_binds_or_collides` — the binding carried as the HONEST DISJUNCTION, never a
    global injectivity claim the deployment refutes.
  * `rotV3Wide_commit8_binds_of_noColl` — the instance-local restoration. ⚑ This is NOT the deleted
    `Poseidon2WideCR` floor smuggled back: that floor quantified over ALL inputs and is FALSE at
    deployed BabyBear parameters (pigeonhole); `¬ WireColl permW l ir l' ir'` is a claim about the
    TWO SPECIFIC lists a total extractor returns for THIS pair, refutable per instance and carrying
    no universal quantifier.
  * Canaries at EIGHT felts, both polarities.

## Per-tag: there is nothing per-tag to do, and that is a THEOREM not a shortcut

At 1 felt the commitment is emitted INSIDE each effect's descriptor, so each of the seventeen tags
needed its own `*_commit_iff` instance. At 8 felts it is emitted by the ROTATION WRAPPER:
`rotateV3Wide (d : EffectVmDescriptor)` appends the wide BEFORE/AFTER blocks to an ARBITRARY host
descriptor, and `rotV3WidePin` / the results below are quantified over `(base, cbase)` — so every
tag's wide commitment is the SAME theorem at a different base, with zero per-tag obligation. The
seventeen 1-felt `*_commit_iff` stay valid and are NOT subsumed (they certify a different object on
a different column set), so none is deleted.

## Axiom hygiene

read-only; `rotV3WidePin` / `siteLookupsN_sound` / `wireCommitR8_binds_or_collides` are used AS-IS.

/-! ## §1 — `WideChain8`: the row's carriers ARE the genuine chained absorption.

This is exactly the conclusion `siteLookupsN_sound` produces from a satisfying lookup family, read
as a predicate ON THE ROW. It is the 8-felt analogue of the 1-felt engine's `WideCarrier` (the
honest-fill shape of the GROUP-4 columns) — at 8 felts the "fill" is sixty 8-column blocks. -/

/-- **`WideChain8 permW env base cbase`** — every one of the sixty wide sites' 8 output columns

/-! ## §2 — the chip table a PROVER BUILDS (completeness without a new floor).

The `→` direction rides `ChipTableSoundN` — every table row is a genuine chip row. The `←` direction
needs the converse resource: the table must CONTAIN the rows this block looks up. Positing "the
table contains every genuine row" would be a fresh, unmotivated floor. Instead we EXHIBIT the table
the prover actually builds — precisely the sixty rows this block needs — and prove it sound. So the
completeness half assumes nothing that the deployed prover does not itself construct. -/

A true `⟺` whose right-hand side is unsatisfiable certifies nothing — the engine this one mirrors

not this file's disease:

  * **the honest carrier-fill LANDS on the commitment** — for the realistic avalanching `refWide8`,
    at the deployed 178-limb / 60-carrier shape, the chain of `chainFrom8` prefixes folded through the
    sixty sites has its final carrier EQUAL to `wireCommitR8` (`demoCarrier59_is_commit`, EXECUTED):
    the completeness construction's fill is the published commitment, not an unrelated value.
  * **a row PROVABLY satisfies the flagship's RHS** — `const_commit_iff8` exhibits a `(permW, env)`
    at which `WideChain8` AND the commit equation both hold (via the flagship's `←` leg), so the
    biconditional's right side is genuinely inhabited. -/

completeness leg and the flagship `⟺` yields a `(permW, env)` at which `WideChain8` AND the published
commit equation both hold: the biconditional is not vacuously true. -/
