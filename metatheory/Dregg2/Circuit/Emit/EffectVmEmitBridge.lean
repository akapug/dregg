# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitBridge — the FAITHFUL-ENCODING bridge for the TRANSFER row.

`EffectVmEmitTransfer.transferVm_faithful` proves the emitted gates accept a row IFF the
ROW-level `TransferRowIntent` holds. `Spec.CircuitSpecTriangle.transfer_circuit_pins_intent`
proves the ABSTRACT circuit pins the kernel transfer `intentTransfer`/`recTransferBal` over
`RecordKernelState`. The amplification-worklist §5 finding #1 flags these as TWO UNBRIDGED
proof layers: nothing proves the 186-column row IS a faithful encoding of the kernel record, so
the per-row faithfulness does NOT inherit the abstract intent guarantee.

This module builds that bridge for TRANSFER. It defines a faithful-encoding relation
`RowEncodes env pre post a actor amt dir` pinning the row's columns to the actual kernel fields of
an abstract record transition, and proves the HEADLINE biconditional + the END-TO-END composition
with `transferVm_faithful`:

    the EMITTED gates accept the row  ⟺  the encoded kernel transition is the correct
    protocol transfer of the actor's ledger column.

## What the row PINS vs what it does NOT (the boundary)

The EffectVM transfer row carries ONE cell's balance as a single `bal_lo` limb (the ACTOR cell),
the actor's nonce, the transfer `amount`/`direction`, and the frozen frame. `recKExecAsset` /
`recTransferBal` move a 2-CELL, ASSET-INDEXED ledger (`bal : CellId → AssetId → ℤ`): debit
`src` column `a`, credit `dst` column `a`. So the row faithfully encodes **the actor cell's own
asset-`a` column move** (`direction = 1` ⟹ actor is `src`, debited; `direction = 0` ⟹ actor is
`dst`, credited), and the bridge pins EXACTLY that.

  * PINS (the bridge proves these, both directions): the actor's `bal actor a` entry moves by
    `actorDelta amt dir = amt·(1 - 2·dir)`, i.e. the actor's side of `recTransferBal` (debit if
    src, credit if dst); `dir` is a bit. Via the END-TO-END composition the EMITTED GATES enforce
    exactly this.
  * ALSO PINNED at the row (carried as encoding conditions because the row has these
    columns): the actor's nonce ticks by one; the actor's `bal_hi` + cap_root + reserved + 8
    fields are frozen — the honest shape of a transfer encoding.
  * DOES NOT PIN (out of the row's witness — these live in the abstract layer / turn root):
      - the COUNTERPARTY cell's column (the row carries only the actor's limb, not `dst`/`src`'s);
      - the ASSET INDEX `a` distinguishing `bal · a` from `bal · b` (the row's `bal_lo` is a bare
        limb; which asset column it is comes from the encoding choice, not a row gate);
      - the AUTHORIZATION / availability / liveness GUARD of `recKExecAsset` (`authorizedB`,
        `0 ≤ amt ≤ bal src a`, `src ∈ accounts`) — the row has no cap-graph columns;
      - the cap-graph, nullifier set, escrow store contents (frozen `cap_root` HASH only).

So this is an HONEST PARTIAL bridge with a precise boundary: it pins the actor's single-column
ledger move (the part the row witnesses) + the honest frame-freeze/nonce-tick, and is
explicit that the counterparty/asset-index/guard are NOT row-level. This respects worklist finding
#2 (no overclaiming set-membership/uniqueness) — transfer is a pure balance-delta, so the part the
row DOES carry bridges cleanly and TOTALLY (both directions) to the abstract actor-column move.

/-! ## §1 — The abstract actor-column move.

The actor's side of `recTransferBal`: cell `actor`'s asset-`a` column moves by the signed amount.
`direction = 1` ⟹ actor is the debited `src` (`- amt`); `direction = 0` ⟹ actor is the credited
`dst` (`+ amt`). This is the EXACT projection of `recTransferBal` onto the actor's `(actor, a)`
entry (proved by `recTransferBal_src`/`_dst`). -/

/-- **`actorDelta amt dir`** — the signed amount applied to the actor's column: `amt·(1 - 2·dir)`.
`dir = 1` ⟹ `-amt` (debit); `dir = 0` ⟹ `+amt` (credit). -/
def actorDelta (amt dir : ℤ) : ℤ := amt * (1 - 2 * dir)

/-- Field-denotation glue for the bridge: under the DEPLOYED canonicality envelope (`0 ≤ · < p`,
the range-check invariant), a mod-`p` congruence between two canonical integers COLLAPSES to ℤ
equality — the residual lies in `(−p, p)`, so `p ∣ residual` forces it to 0. This is how the
mod-`p` `TransferRowIntent` clauses reach the ℤ-level kernel ledger statement. -/

/-- **`AbstractTransferActorMove pre post a actor amt dir`** — the abstract kernel statement the
row claims to encode: cell `actor`'s asset-`a` ledger column in `post` is its `pre` value moved by
the signed amount, and `dir` is a bit. This is the actor-column projection of the abstract transfer
`recTransferBal` (NOT the whole 2-cell move — the row only witnesses the actor's column). -/

/-! ## §2 — The faithful-encoding relation `RowEncodes`.

`RowEncodes env pre post a actor amt dir` says: the row `env` is the HONEST encoding of the
abstract transfer transition that moves cell `actor`'s asset-`a` column from `pre.bal actor a` to
`post.bal actor a`, with the row's `direction` = `dir` and `amount` = `amt`. It pins the row's
columns to the kernel fields the row carries.

The encoding is INJECTIVE on what it claims: distinct `(pre.bal actor a, post.bal actor a)` give
distinct row `bal_lo` columns, and tampering `post.bal actor a` away from the move breaks the
equivalence (the anti-ghost tooth, §4). It does NOT claim the row carries the counterparty/asset/
guard — those are not fields of `RowEncodes`. -/

/-- **`RowEncodes env pre post a actor amt dir`** — the row faithfully encodes the actor-column
transfer transition. The row's `bal_lo` carries the integer ledger value `bal actor a` (pre and
post), `amount`/`direction` carry the move magnitude/sign, the actor's nonce ticks, and
`bal_hi`/frame are frozen (the honest shape of a transfer encoding). -/

/-! ## §3 — THE BRIDGE: row-intent ⟺ abstract actor-column move.

The headline. On a faithful encoding, the row-level `TransferRowIntent` holds IFF the abstract
actor-column move `AbstractTransferActorMove` holds. The row-intent's balance/direction clauses
translate, through the encoding's column pins, EXACTLY into the abstract ledger statement; the
hi/nonce/frame clauses are CARRIED by the encoding (they are the honest transfer shape), so the
biconditional is clean in BOTH directions. -/

/-- **`bridge_abstract_to_rowIntent` — the UNCONDITIONAL direction.** An honest encoding of a
genuine abstract actor-column move satisfies the FIELD-level `TransferRowIntent`: every ℤ equality
the encoding + abstract move pin lifts to a mod-`p` congruence (`eqToModEq`) — no canonicality
needed to go FROM kernel truth INTO the field. -/

ABSTRACT actor-column move `AbstractTransferActorMove pre post a actor amt dir` holds. The two
proof layers MEET at the encoding: the row's `bal_lo`/`direction`/`amount` columns ARE the actor's
ledger value / direction / amount, so the row's balance-move clause IS the abstract ledger move.

FIELD-FAITHFUL: `TransferRowIntent` is now mod-`p` congruences, so the FORWARD direction (field
gates → ℤ kernel move) needs the DEPLOYED canonicality envelope — the direction bit, the post
ledger value, and the intended moved value each lie in `[0, p)` (the range-check invariant + the
no-overflow move). Under it a field congruence between canonical values collapses to ℤ equality
(`canon_modEq_eq`), so NO wrap-around forgery survives. The backward direction stays unconditional
(`bridge_abstract_to_rowIntent`). -/

/-! ## §4 — END-TO-END: the EMITTED GATES accept the row ⟺ the correct protocol transfer.

Compose the bridge with `EffectVmEmitTransfer.transferVm_faithful`
(emitted gates ⟺ `TransferRowIntent`). The result is the load-bearing statement of the whole
campaign: on a faithfully-encoded transfer row, the EMITTED descriptor's per-row gates accept the
row IFF the encoded kernel transition is the correct protocol transfer of the actor's ledger
column. THAT is "the emitted circuit enforces the protocol effect." -/

/-- **`emittedGates_iff_protocolTransfer` — THE END-TO-END THEOREM.** On a row that faithfully
encodes the actor-column transfer transition (`RowEncodes`), the EMITTED descriptor's per-row gates
(`transferRowGates`, the term-for-term mirror of the running prover's transfer polynomials) ALL
hold IFF the abstract kernel statement `AbstractTransferActorMove pre post a actor amt dir` holds —
i.e. the actor's `bal actor a` column moves by exactly `recTransferBal`'s signed delta. The two
proof layers (row-faithfulness + abstract-encoding) are now BRIDGED for transfer. FIELD-FAITHFUL:
the gates→kernel direction carries the deployed canonicality envelope (see
`bridge_rowIntent_iff_abstract`); kernel→gates stays unconditional. -/

/-! ## §5 — ANTI-GHOST: tampering the actor's post-ledger entry breaks acceptance.

Two teeth. (a) If the encoded `post.bal actor a` is NOT the correct signed move, then the emitted
gates REJECT the row (`gBalLo` UNSAT) — a forged post-ledger cannot pass. (b) A concrete tampered
witness: a debit-30 transfer whose post-ledger is forged to a wrong value has no satisfying gate set.

This is the conservation-≠-correctness anti-ghost: the row pins the WHOLE actor-column transition
it claims; you cannot credit/debit a different amount than the move and still satisfy the gate. -/

/-- **Anti-ghost (general).** On a faithful encoding, if the actor's post-ledger entry is NOT the
signed move (`post.bal actor a ≠ pre.bal actor a + actorDelta amt dir`), the emitted per-row gates
have NO satisfying assignment for the row — the encoded forgery is UNSAT. FIELD-FAITHFUL: the tooth
rejects a field-`≢` output, so it needs the DEPLOYED canonicality envelope on the post ledger value
and the intended moved value (both in `[0, p)`): a canonical forgery differs from the intended
value by less than `p`, so it cannot pass the field gate by wrap-around. No direction envelope is
needed — the forgery is stated against the raw signed delta. -/
