# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.BilateralAggregationRung2 — the RUNG-2 discharge of the terminal-cell
no-double-spend obligation for the emitted BILATERAL-AGGREGATION descriptor
(`bilateralAggDescriptor`), and the load-bearing FORGERY that proves it is genuinely needed.

## What Rung 1 left (`BilateralAggregationRefine.lean`)

RUNG 1 proved the whole-descriptor bridge `bilateralAgg_refines : Satisfied2 ∧ nonempty ∧
AggTraceCanon ∧ |rows| < p ⟹ BundleAggregated t` (FIELD-FAITHFUL: the descriptor pins gates only
`≡ 0 [ZMOD p]`, so the bridge threads the explicit canonicality envelope), whose crown (CG-4) is

  * `exactlyOneAgent : prefixSum (isAgentAt t) (last) = 1`   ("exactly one agent cell")
  * `publishedCount  : pub[N_CELLS] = prefixSum (consistentAt t) (last)`.

The security property this family exists for is the CROSS-FEDERATION DOUBLE-SPEND rejection: only ONE
cell across the bundle may claim the acting-agent seat (`multi_cell_cross_fed_binding`). But
`∑ is_agent = 1` is STRICTLY WEAKER than "exactly one cell has the boolean flag `1`", and the gap is
exploitable — because the `is_agent ∈ {0,1}` boolean is a `.base (.gate _)`, DIVIDED BY THE
TRANSITION ZEROFIER, so it is VACUOUS on the last cell (`holdsVm_gate_true`). A prover may therefore
seat TWO genuine agents (`is_agent = 1` on two cells) and absorb the excess in a PHANTOM last cell
carrying the CANONICAL anti-agent `is_agent = p − 1 ≡ −1` (a perfectly canonical field element that
escapes the vacuous last-row gate): the cumulative still lands at `1` in the FIELD, the trace
`Satisfied2`s, and the mod-`p` crown is satisfied by a genuine double-spend. `§4 cheatTrace` /
`cheat_double_spend` exhibit exactly this — the anchor below is LOAD-BEARING, not laundered. It is
also WHY Rung 1's envelope must carry last-row booleanity (`AggTraceCanon.lastAgentBool`): without
it even the ℤ crown `∑ = 1` is forgeable through the `p − 1` wrap.

## The residual and its carrier (why this is RUNG2_PARTIAL, not a crypto discharge)

The bilateral-aggregation AIR declares NO tables / hash-sites / ranges / map-ops
(`memOpsOf_agg`/`mapOpsOf_agg = []`): it is CRYPTO-FREE. So — unlike the DFA-routing template, whose
terminal-step residual `hterm` is discharged from the running-hash route-commitment binding under the
`CollisionFree` CR carrier — there is NO crypto carrier here, and NOTHING in `Satisfied2` binds the
last cell's `is_agent` column to any committed reference. The residual is an AIR-COMPLETENESS gap: the
last-row boolean the transition-zerofier lowering drops. Its carrier is therefore the named
hypothesis

  `LastCellAgentBoolean t := isAgentAt t (last) = 0 ∨ isAgentAt t (last) = 1`

— what the EMIT-FIX supplies, NOT a Lean axiom and NOT a crypto primitive. Under the field-faithful
denotation this carrier rides INSIDE Rung 1's envelope (`AggTraceCanon.lastAgentBool` — the ℤ crown
itself needs it, see the forgery). Under it (all non-last cells are already boolean, forced by the
gate off the last row + primality + canonicality), the genuine

  `UniqueAgent t` — a cell carries the flag `1`, and it is UNIQUE (no two distinct agent cells)

follows unconditionally (`bilateralAgg_rung2`). The carrier is proven load-bearing (the cheat fails it
and fails `UniqueAgent`) and satisfiable (the honest `witTrace` meets it and the discharge FIRES,
`witness_rung2_fires`), so the theorem is non-vacuous.

## The named emit-fix (the one-line additive change that promotes this to RUNG2_PROVED)

Add a LAST-ROW BOOLEAN BOUNDARY for `is_agent` (fires on the last cell, NOT divided by the transition
zerofier) to `EffectVmEmitBilateralAgg.aggConstraints`:

  `.base (.boundary .last (.mul (.var (Agg.schCol Sched.IS_AGENT_CELL))
                                (.add (.var (Agg.schCol Sched.IS_AGENT_CELL)) (.const (-1)))))`

(and the analogous `.boundary .last` boolean for `Agg.CONSISTENT_INDICATOR_COL`, which closes the
symmetric `pub[N_CELLS]` over-count via a phantom `consistent = k>1` last cell). That boundary
DISCHARGES `LastCellAgentBoolean` from `Satisfied2` directly (via `boundaryLast_forces`), at which
point `bilateralAgg_rung2` closes with NO residual. The Rust twin adds the same `when_last_row`
boolean assert; the shape pin `aggConstraints.length == 70` becomes `72`. This file cannot make that
edit (ADDITIVE-ONLY: one new file, no edits to existing ones) — it PROVES the discharge is correct and
NAMES the fix precisely.

## Axiom hygiene / non-vacuity

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}: the residual rides as the NAMED
`LastCellAgentBoolean` hypothesis, never a Lean axiom, and no crypto carrier is needed (crypto-free
family). §4 is the load-bearing cheat (two boolean agents, `Satisfied2`, `∑ = 1`, `¬ UniqueAgent`);
§5 is the firing witness. NEW file; imports read-only.

`Satisfied2`s under the FIELD denotation (the cumulative window `1 → 2 → 1` wraps through the
modulus: `2 + (p−1) ≡ 1`), its field crown `∑ is_agent ≡ 1 [ZMOD p]` holds (the ℤ sum is `p + 1`),
yet TWO federations seat the agent: a genuine cross-federation double-spend. The cheat's cells and

boolean carrier is genuinely load-bearing — the conclusion is impossible from `Satisfied2` + cell
