# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.DfaRoutingRung2 — the RUNG-2 discharge of the terminal-step obligation for the
emitted DFA-routing descriptor (`dfaRoutingDesc`), via the Poseidon2 route-commitment binding.

## What this file IS

`DfaRoutingRefine.lean` (RUNG 1) proves the bridge `Satisfied2 ∧ nonempty ∧ hterm ⟹ genuine run ∧
final = classify(input)`, where `hterm` is the terminal-step obligation: the LAST row is also a
genuine transition. The deployed STARK divides every per-row constraint by the TRANSITION zerofier
(`circuit/src/stark.rs`), so the toggle gate is NOT enforced on the last row — `hterm` is exactly the
gap the gate lowering leaves. RUNG 2 DISCHARGES `hterm` from the running-hash route-commitment
binding, so the top-level conclusion `final = classify(input)` rides the standard Poseidon2 CR
carrier instead of an unenforced witness column.

## Why an anchor is genuinely needed (this is NOT laundering)

Unconditional `Satisfied2 ⟹ final = classify` is FALSE, and provably so: a prover may set the last
row's `next` to ANY value, compute the matching entry/running hashes, and expose that as
`final_state` / `route_commitment`. Every gate (divided by the zerofier) still holds on the non-last
rows, both chip lookups still hold on every row, and B2/B3 pin the fake values — so the trace
`Satisfied2`, yet `final ≠ classify(input)` (`rung2_needs_anchor`, §6: the honest `witTrace` with its
last edge flipped `Satisfied2`s with a wrong final). The soundness of "classified to S" therefore
pivots on the DISCLOSED `route_commitment` being the honest commitment of a genuine run — which is
what the constitution/registry anchor supplies, and what the CR binding converts into `hterm`.

## The discharge (the route-commitment binding, `DfaAcceptanceAir`)

Instantiate `Digest = State = Sym = ℤ`, with the Poseidon2 primitives realized as the descriptor's
own `hash` (`compress a b := hash [a,b]`, `compressN l := hash l` — `dfaPrims`). Against a SOUND chip
table (`ChipTableSound hash` — the chip-AIR faithfulness carrier, `chip_lookup_sound`), the entry /
running lookups of `Satisfied2` force, ON EVERY ROW (lookups are not divided by the zerofier):

  * entry:   `entry_hashᵢ  = hash [currentᵢ, symbolᵢ, nextᵢ, zero_laneᵢ]`   (C1, `compressN`)
  * running: `running_i    = hash [accᵢ, entry_hashᵢ]`                      (C3, `compress`)

with the copy-forward window + seed pin threading `accᵢ`, so the last `running` column is the
`runningFold tableCommitment (entryHashes …)` (`lastRunning_eq_fold`) and B3 pins it to the public
`route_commitment`. Given the CR carrier `CollisionFree (dfaPrims hash)` and a GENUINE reference run
`g` (full `DfaAcceptanceAir.Satisfies`) with the SAME `tableCommitment` / `route_commitment` / length
— the honest anchor — `fold_inj` forces `entryHashes t = entryHashes g`, hence (by `compressN_inj` on
the last entry-hash, using the ALL-ROWS entry lookup) the last `(current, symbol, next)` triple of
`t` equals `g`'s genuine last triple, so `next_last = step(current_last, symbol_last)` — exactly
`hterm`. Feeding it to RUNG 1's `dfaRouting_refines_classify` yields `final = classify(input)`
unconditionally on `hterm`.

## Axiom hygiene / non-vacuity

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; the CR carrier `CollisionFree`, the
chip-soundness carrier `ChipTableSound`, and — under the field-faithful mod-`p` denotation — the two
range-check envelopes (`DfaTraceCanon` from Rung 1, `DfaChainCanon` for the running-hash spine,
lifting the mod-`p` seed/copy-forward/route pins to the ℤ equalities the re-hashing fold needs) ride
as NAMED hypotheses, never as Lean axioms, and are jointly inhabited (`refWitness_fires`, over a
reference hash both injective and canonical at the witness digests). §6 exhibits a
concrete satisfying witness (a genuine 2-row toggle run over a REAL injective `hash`, with the CR
carrier discharged from injectivity — `dfaPrims`-`CollisionFree` is inhabited) whose Rung-2 conclusion
FIRES with the true classification, and the cheating trace whose last edge is flipped, which
`Satisfied2`s but breaks the anchor — so the anchor is a real filter, not `True`. NEW file; imports

chip lookup binds) and `compressN l := hash l` (the sponge the entry-hash chip lookup binds). The
Pedersen/nullifier carriers are the trivial witnesses (unused by the DFA-routing binding). Marked
`@[reducible]` so the abstract-Poseidon denotations of `DfaAcceptanceAir` compute to `hash`-shaped
equations; forced via `letI` everywhere (the tree also registers a global `CryptoPrimitives Int`). -/

/-- **The CR carrier is instantiable from hash injectivity.** If `hash` is injective (as a function

`hash`-injectivity, and `compress`-pair-injectivity is `hash`-injectivity on 2-element lists. (A
genuine Poseidon2 `hash` supplies CR, not literal injectivity; this is the reference realization that
makes the RUNG-2 hypothesis set non-vacuous, mirroring `DfaAcceptanceAir.Reference.refCollisionFree`.)

/-! ## §4.5 — the chain canonicality envelope.

Under the field-faithful mod-`p` denotation the seed pin / copy-forward window / B3 route pin bind
only congruences; the running-hash spine RE-HASHES each digest, so a bare congruence cannot thread
through the abstract `hash`. The deployed range-check invariant on the spine cells + the two bound
public inputs is what lifts them to the genuine ℤ equalities the fold argument needs. Inhabited
concretely in §7 (`wtTrace_chainCanon` over the reference hash), so the envelope is non-vacuous. -/

/-- **The chain canonicality envelope** — the running-hash spine cells (`ACC`, `RUNNING_HASH`) are
canonical field cells (`0 ≤ · < p`) on every row, and so are the two bound public inputs
(`pi[table_commitment]`, `pi[route_commitment]`). -/

/-! ## §5 — THE RUNG-2 DISCHARGE. -/

/-- **`dfaRouting_rung2` — the terminal-step obligation `hterm` is DISCHARGED by the route-commitment
binding.**

A trace `t` that `Satisfied2`s the emitted `dfaRoutingDesc`, is non-empty, rides a SOUND Poseidon2
chip table (`hchip`, the chip-AIR faithfulness carrier), the CR carrier `cf : CollisionFree`, and — as
the honest route-commitment anchor — a GENUINE reference run `g` (a full `DfaAcceptanceAir.Satisfies`
over the pinned toggle DFA, encodings `id`, with the SAME `tableCommitment` and public
`routeCommitment` and the same length) has its exposed public `final_state` equal to `classify(input)`
— WITHOUT `hterm` as a hypothesis.

The binding fires: both traces' last `running` columns are the SAME `runningFold tableCommitment
(entryHashes …)` (pinned to the public `routeCommitment` by B3), so `fold_inj` forces
`entryHashes t = entryHashes g`; the ALL-ROWS entry lookup + `compressN`-CR (`cf`) then force the last
`(current, symbol, next)` triple of `t` to equal `g`'s genuine last triple, so `next_last =
step(current_last, symbol_last)` — exactly `hterm`. Feeding it to RUNG 1's
`dfaRouting_refines_classify` gives the classification. -/

/-! ## §7 — Non-vacuity, TRUE half: the RUNG-2 discharge FIRES on a genuine witness.

A genuine 1-row toggle run `IDLE=0 →symbol=1 1` (reading `[1]`, `classify = 1`) over a REAL injective
`hash` (so the CR carrier is discharged from `Function.Injective hash` via `collisionFree_of_injective`
— the same shape `DfaAcceptanceAir.Reference` uses). Every hypothesis of `dfaRouting_rung2` is met — the
descriptor `Satisfied2`, a SOUND chip table, the CR carrier, and the honest genuine reference run `g`
(itself) with the matching public route commitment — and the discharged conclusion FIRES:
`final = 1 = classify (pinnedDfa 0) [1]`. So the hypothesis set is jointly satisfiable and the RUNG-2
conclusion is achievably true (not vacuous). -/

/-! ## §7b — the reference hash: the RUNG-2 hypothesis set is JOINTLY satisfiable.

`Function.Injective hash` (the CR reference realization) and canonicality of the witness's route
digest are exhibited TOGETHER on one concrete hash: the two witness digests are pinned to the
reserved canonical values `1` / `2`, and every other list rides the injective `Encodable.encode`
shifted past them — injective as a whole, canonical where the witness reads it. So neither envelope
hypothesis of `wtTrace_rung2_fires` is vacuous, jointly or alone. -/
