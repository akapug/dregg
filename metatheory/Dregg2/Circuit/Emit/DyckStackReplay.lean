# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.DyckStackReplay — SLICE 4 of *parse as derivation*: the CAPSTONE that
closes the SAT⇒Replay loop.

`docs/DESIGN-parse-as-derivation.md` §3/§5.1 names the hard part deferred through slices 1–3: the
whole-descriptor bridge

    parse_sat_imp_replay :
      Satisfied2 dyckDesc … t  →  ReplayAccepts dyck (rulesOf t) (inputOf t)

— "a satisfying trace IS an accepting leftmost pushdown replay of the Dyck grammar." §3 calls this a
"genuine transition-relation induction across all active rows, with the STACK as the inductive
invariant" and flags it as the multi-month-*risk* item.

## What slice 3 already landed (verified at HEAD, `DyckStackRefine.lean`)

Two proven halves stand there, joined by ONE honestly-named residual (its §7):

* **(§4.1) the per-row bridge** `dyck_sat_imp_row_valid` — a trace `Satisfied2 dyckDesc`, canonical
  (`DyckCanon`), witnesses the genuine per-row relation `DyckRowValid` on EVERY transition row.
* **(§6) the multi-row assembly** `mrun_imp_replay` — a FORWARD `MRun` of per-row-valid steps ending
  in an accepting `done` IS a backward `CfgCompact.Replay`, with the rule sequence RECONSTRUCTED by
  `rulesOf` and the stack threaded as the induction invariant. This is the design's named hard part,
  and it is proven, not assumed.
* **(§7) the seam between them** — the DECODE GLUE: a function `decode : VmTrace → List MRow` reading
  each row's `STACK[0..D−1]` + `STACK_DEPTH` back into a `List (Symbol Brk NTs)`, its `Act` from the
  selectors, its remaining input from `INPUT_POS`; plus the per-row lemma `DyckRowValid (envAt t i) →
  MStep (decode t)[i] (decode t)[i+1]`. Its general form needs the **depth↔occupancy invariant**
  `dyck_stack.rs` still owes ("nothing yet ties `STACK_DEPTH` to which cells are nonzero").

## What THIS file (slice 4) adds

1. **`replay_of_run_initial`** (§1) — the stack-invariant fold's payoff stated at the `ReplayAccepts`
   level: an `MRun` whose head stack is the grammar's initial nonterminal IS an accepting replay.
   This is `mrun_imp_replay` lifted to the acceptance predicate; it is the "assemble per-row validity
   into a whole pushdown replay" of the prompt, PROVEN.
2. **The decode (§2)** — `symOfId` / `decodeStack` / `decodeAct` / `decodeRow` / `decodeRun`: the §7
   decode function, written concretely. It reads the same `STACK[i]` / `STACK_DEPTH` / selector /
   `INPUT_POS` columns the per-row teeth constrain.
3. **`decode_witTrace`** (§3) — the §7 decode seam CLOSED for the shipped bracket-pair trace: the
   satisfying `witTrace` (proven `Satisfied2` in slice 3, `DyckStackRefine.witTrace_satisfies`)
   decodes to the accepting forward run `bRow0 :: bracketsRest`. For this concrete trace the
   depth↔occupancy invariant holds by COMPUTATION, so the seam needs no circuit tooth here.
4. **`witTrace_replays`** (§3) — the concrete `parse_sat_imp_replay`: the decoded run assembles,
   through `mrun_imp_replay`, into `ReplayAccepts dyck [rBracket, rEmpty] [op, cl]` — EXACTLY the
   statement of the hand proof `CfgCompact.Reference.brackets_replays`, reached here from the actual
   circuit trace via decode.
5. **`witTrace_steps_valid`** (§3) — the satisfaction is load-bearing: the circuit's acceptance of
   `witTrace` CERTIFIES (via the per-row bridge) that every decoded transition row is a genuine
   pushdown step. Acceptance ⇒ valid steps; decode ⇒ the run; the two compose into the replay.
6. **`witTrace_in_language`** (§3) — the consistency check the prompt asks for: `compact_sound` on the
   produced `ReplayAccepts` recovers `[op, cl] ∈ dyck.language`.
7. **`witTrace_satisfies_and_replays`** (§4) — the closed loop for the shipped word, stated as the
   honest conjunction: the concrete trace is BOTH accepted by the circuit AND decodes to an accepting
   grammar replay.
8. **`decode_step`** (§2.3) — ONE `MStep` of the abstract run from ONE valid transition row: the
   per-action cell equations (`bracketPush`/`emptyPop`/`termPop`), assembled by
   `decodeStack_push`/`decodeStack_pop` over the length-pinned (occupancy) decoded stack, ARE the
   `MStep` stack relation `b.stk = r.output ++ rest`. The structural core the residual named.
9. **`mrun_from` / `parse_sat_imp_replay`** (§4.5) — the forward `MRun` threaded across an ARBITRARY
   satisfying trace (padding truncated at the first `done`), folded through `replay_of_run_initial`
   into `ReplayAccepts`. THE GENERAL SOUNDNESS THEOREM. `witTrace_replays_via_general` (§5) recovers
   the shipped case as an instance.

## SCOPE (honest, per the iterative method)

**The general theorem is now PROVEN.** `parse_sat_imp_replay` holds for an ARBITRARY trace `t` and
word `word` — the satisfaction predicate is what forces every decoded row to be a genuine pushdown
step (`decode_step`), so soundness is load-bearing, not a `rfl` on a fixed constant. It rests on the
depth↔occupancy tooth (`DyckStackRefine.occupied_of_sat` + `decodeStack_length_of_sat`), read out of
the deployed accept-set, plus honest boundary/tape hypotheses (initial-symbol PI, the halt row, the
input columns spelling `word`). The concrete `witTrace_replays` is kept as a sanity instance and is
also re-derived through the general theorem (`witTrace_replays_via_general`).

/-! ## §1 — THE ASSEMBLY, at the acceptance predicate: an `MRun` from the initial stack IS an
accepting replay.

`mrun_imp_replay` (slice 3, §6) is the transition-relation induction with the stack as invariant:
it turns a forward `MRun a rest` into `Replay dyck (rulesOf (a :: rest)) a.inp a.stk`. Here we pin the
head stack to the grammar's initial nonterminal, which is exactly the initial stack `ReplayAccepts`
opens on — so the run becomes an ACCEPTING replay. This is the "fold per-row validity forward,
maintaining `Replay g rs_so_far input_remaining stack_of_row` as the invariant" step, delivered. It is
general in the run length: no concreteness is used. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE DECODE (the §7 seam, written concretely).

`decode` reads a trace row back into the `MRow` the abstract machine carries: the stack cells
`STACK[0..STACK_DEPTH)` under the symbol-id map, the action from the selectors + `RULE_ID`, and the
remaining input as the suffix of the word from `INPUT_POS`. These are the SAME columns
`DyckRowValid`'s per-action teeth constrain (`ruleTopIsS`, `bracketPush`, `termTopIsToken`,
`termAdvances`, …). -/

/-- The symbol-id map (`dyck_stack.rs`'s `SYM_*`): `1 ↦ S`, `2 ↦ op`, `3 ↦ cl`, everything else
(the `0 = EMPTY` marker, out-of-range) is absent. -/
def symOfId (z : ℤ) : Option (Symbol Brk NTs) :=
  if z = SYM_S then some (Symbol.nonterminal NTs.S)
  else if z = SYM_OP then some (Symbol.terminal op)
  else if z = SYM_CL then some (Symbol.terminal cl)
  else none

/-- Read the working stack: the first `STACK_DEPTH` cells (top at index `0`), symbol-decoded. The
`EMPTY` marker maps to nothing, so a well-formed occupancy yields exactly the live prefix. -/
def decodeStack (a : Assignment) : List (Symbol Brk NTs) :=
  (List.range (a STACK_DEPTH).toNat).filterMap (fun i => symOfId (a (stk i)))

/-- Read the action from the selectors + `RULE_ID` + `INPUT_TOKEN` (`dyck_stack.rs::Action`). -/
def decodeAct (a : Assignment) : Act :=
  if a IS_RULE = 1 then
    (if a RULE_ID = RULE_BRACKET then Act.rule rBracket else Act.rule rEmpty)
  else if a IS_TERM = 1 then
    (if a INPUT_TOKEN = SYM_OP then Act.term op else Act.term cl)
  else Act.done

/-- Decode one row against the input `word`: the remaining input is `word` dropped by `INPUT_POS`. -/
def decodeRow (word : List Brk) (a : Assignment) : MRow :=
  ⟨decodeAct a, decodeStack a, word.drop (a INPUT_POS).toNat⟩

/-- Decode the first `n` rows of a trace into a forward run. (The general `decode` truncates at the
first `done`; the concrete run length is supplied here — the truncation lemma is part of the §5
residual, not needed for the shipped fixed-length witness.) -/
def decodeRun (word : List Brk) (t : VmTrace) (n : Nat) : List MRow :=
  (List.range n).map (fun i => decodeRow word (t.rows.getD i zeroAsg))

/-! ## §2.1 — THE OCCUPANCY PAYOFF: the new circuit tooth makes `decodeStack` DROP NOTHING.

This is the part of the §5 residual the depth↔occupancy tooth (`dyck_stack.rs::occupancy_tooth`,
derived from the accept-set by `DyckStackRefine.occupied_of_sat`) DISCHARGES. Before the tooth,
`decodeStack`'s `filterMap` could silently drop an `EMPTY` hole below the pointer, making the decoded
stack SHORTER than `STACK_DEPTH` and breaking the correspondence with the shift equations. With the
tooth, every cell `[0, STACK_DEPTH)` is a real symbol, so the `filterMap` keeps all of them and the
decoded stack has length EXACTLY `STACK_DEPTH` — the invariant the general `decode_step` threads. -/

/-- **`decodeStack_length` — THE TOOTH'S PAYOFF, abstractly.** If every cell strictly below the

/-- **`decodeStack_length_of_sat` — the payoff on a SATISFYING trace.** The circuit's acceptance
(`Satisfied2`) now CERTIFIES, via `occupied_of_sat`, that the decoded working stack of any transition
row has length exactly its `STACK_DEPTH`. The `EMPTY`-hole failure the general `decode_step` had to
rule out by hand is retired by the tooth. -/

/-! ## §2.2 — `decodeStack` AS A MAP, and the DEPTH-POSITIVITY the top-cell tooth gives.

The occupancy tooth (`decodeStack_length`) says the `filterMap` drops nothing; here we go one step
further and give `decodeStack` its explicit `map` form — every live cell decodes to a definite
symbol (`symTot`). That map form is what the shift equations (`bracketPush`/`emptyPop`/`termPop`)
rewrite pointwise into the `MStep` stack relation `b.stk = r.output ++ rest`. The `empty-above`
family of the tooth also lets us read `STACK_DEPTH ≥ 1` off a row whose top cell is a real symbol —
the fact that keeps a `rule rBracket` step from firing on an empty stack. -/

divide the (small, nonzero) top, so it must vanish a depth factor — pinning `STACK_DEPTH ∈ {1,…,5}`.

/-! ## §2.3 — `decode_step`: ONE `MStep` of the abstract run, from ONE valid transition row.

This is the structural core the §5 residual named — now proven, not deferred. On a transition row
`i` that is NOT a `done` row, `dyck_sat_imp_row_valid` gives `DyckRowValid`, and the depth↔occupancy
tooth gives the length-pinned decoded stacks; the per-action cell equations
(`bracketPush`/`emptyPop`/`termPop`, assembled by `decodeStack_push`/`decodeStack_pop`) then compose
into the `MStep` stack relation `b.stk = r.output ++ rest`. The `hword` hypothesis pins the tape
columns to the parsed word — the honest "the input columns of `t` spell `word`" of the residual,
load-bearing exactly on the `term` rows (the field-only `INPUT_POS` congruence cannot fix a Nat
position on its own). The `done` self-loop rows are excluded (`hlive`): a halted machine has no
successor step (`MStep .done = False`). -/

/-! ## §3 — THE LOOP CLOSED FOR THE SHIPPED WORD.

`witTrace` (slice 3, §5) is the honest `"[]"` parse `build_brackets_witness` lays, PROVEN in the
deployed accept-set by `DyckStackRefine.witTrace_satisfies`. Its 8 rows are `rule rBracket · term
'[' · rule rEmpty · term ']' · done`, padded with `done` self-loops; the run is the first 5. -/

/-- **`decode_witTrace` — the §7 decode seam, CLOSED for the concrete trace.** The satisfying
`witTrace` decodes (STACK cells + depth + selectors + `INPUT_POS`, read directly) to the accepting
forward run `bRow0 :: bracketsRest` — the SAME abstract machine slice 3's `abs_brackets_accepts`
hand-built, now recovered FROM the circuit trace's columns. For this fixed trace the depth↔occupancy
invariant the general seam needs holds by computation, so no circuit tooth is required here. -/
theorem decode_witTrace : decodeRun [op, cl] witTrace 5 = bRow0 :: bracketsRest := by
  rfl

/-- **`witTrace_replays` — the concrete `parse_sat_imp_replay`.** The decoded run assembles, through
the stack-invariant fold `mrun_imp_replay` (via `replay_of_run_initial`), into an accepting Dyck
replay whose reconstructed certificate is `[rBracket, rEmpty]` and whose word is `[op, cl]` — EXACTLY
`CfgCompact.Reference.brackets_replays`'s statement, reached here from the actual circuit trace. -/

/-- **`witTrace_steps_valid` — the satisfaction is load-bearing.** The circuit's ACCEPTANCE of
`witTrace` certifies, through the slice-3 per-row bridge `dyck_sat_imp_row_valid`, that every one of
the four transition rows the run decodes is a genuine pushdown step (`DyckRowValid`). Acceptance ⇒
valid steps (this lemma) and acceptance's trace decodes to the run (`decode_witTrace`); the two
compose into `witTrace_replays`. Nothing here rests on a vacuous hypothesis: `witTrace_satisfies`
inhabits the `Satisfied2` antecedent. -/

    omega)

/-- **`witTrace_in_language` — the consistency check.** `compact_sound` on the produced
`ReplayAccepts` recovers language membership: the parse certificate the circuit trace decodes to
proves `[op, cl] ∈ dyck.language`, the SAME fact slice 3 reaches by hand. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE CLOSED LOOP, stated honestly.

The concrete capstone is the CONJUNCTION: the shipped trace is BOTH accepted by the deployed circuit
predicate AND decodes to an accepting grammar replay. This is "a satisfying trace IS an accepting
leftmost pushdown replay" — for the shipped word, with the satisfaction genuinely established
(`witTrace_satisfies`), not assumed. -/

/-- **THE CAPSTONE (concrete):** `witTrace` satisfies the deployed Dyck descriptor AND decodes to an
accepting Dyck replay. The SAT⇒Replay loop `docs/DESIGN-parse-as-derivation.md` §3 names, closed for
the bracket-pair witness. -/

/-! ## §4.5 — THE GENERAL THEOREM: `parse_sat_imp_replay`.

The concrete capstone above rides on `decode_witTrace`'s `rfl`. Here the trace is ARBITRARY: the only
levers are the deployed acceptance predicate (`Satisfied2`), the range-check envelope (`DyckCanon`),
and honest boundary/tape hypotheses. The chain is
`dyck_sat_imp_row_valid` (per row) ⟹ `decode_step` (one `MStep`) ⟹ `mrun_from` (the whole `MRun`,
padding truncated at the first `done`) ⟹ `replay_of_run_initial` ⟹ `ReplayAccepts`. Satisfaction is
genuinely load-bearing: `decode_step`'s stack relation is the assembled per-row cell equations, not a
`rfl` on a fixed constant. -/

symbol is `S`, whose input columns spell `word` (`hword` / `hfin_inp`), and whose run halts at an
accepting `done` row `n` (`hdone`) with no earlier halt (`hlive`) — there is a compact certificate
`rulesOf (decodeRun word t (n+1))` whose leftmost pushdown replay ACCEPTS `word`. A satisfying trace
IS an accepting Dyck replay. Unlike the concrete `witTrace_replays`, satisfaction is load-bearing
here: `t` is arbitrary, so the acceptance predicate is what forces every decoded row to be a genuine
pushdown step. -/

/-! ## §5 — THE GENERAL THEOREM IS CLOSED; the concrete case is now an INSTANCE of it.

The §4.6 residual is discharged. `parse_sat_imp_replay` above is the fully-general bridge:

    Satisfied2 dyckDesc t → DyckCanon t → (boundary/tape hypotheses) →
      ReplayAccepts dyck (rulesOf (decodeRun word t (n+1))) word

for an ARBITRARY trace `t` and word `word`, not a fixed constant. The chain that closes it:

  * (slice 3 §4.1)  `dyck_sat_imp_row_valid` : Satisfied2 → ∀ transition row, DyckRowValid   — PROVEN.
  * (§2.3 here)     `decode_step`            : DyckRowValid + occupancy → one `MStep`         — PROVEN.
  * (§4.5 here)     `mrun_from`              : the whole forward `MRun`, padding truncated    — PROVEN.
  * (slice 3 §6)    `mrun_imp_replay`        : MRun → Replay (via `replay_of_run_initial`)    — PROVEN.

The ONE arrow the residual named — `decode_step`, assembling `bracketPush`/`emptyPop`/`termPop` into
the `MStep` stack relation `b.stk = r.output ++ rest` over the now-length-pinned (occupancy) decoded
stack — is proven purely structurally: `decodeStack_push` / `decodeStack_pop` (§2.2). The
depth↔occupancy tooth it stood on (`DyckStackRefine.occupied_of_sat` + `decodeStack_length_of_sat`)
is read out of the deployed accept-set, not assumed. The `done` self-loop padding is truncated at the
accepting row (`MStep .done = False`).

Below, the shipped `witTrace` is recovered as an INSTANCE of the general theorem — the concrete
capstone `witTrace_replays` (which rode a `decode_witTrace` `rfl`) now also follows from
`parse_sat_imp_replay` with all six antecedents discharged from the actual trace. -/

statement to `witTrace_replays`, but here the accepting replay is produced by `parse_sat_imp_replay`

halt, the input-columns-spell-`[op,cl]` tape relation, the fully-consumed tape) discharged by
computation on the deployed witness. The general soundness theorem SUBSUMES the shipped case. -/
