# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.DfaRoutingRefine — the RUNG-1 functional-correctness refinement for the
emitted DFA-routing descriptor (`dfaRoutingDesc`).

## What this file IS

`DfaRoutingEmit.lean` proves only PER-GATE faithfulness lemmas (`transition_body_zero_iff`,
`continuity_window_zero_iff`, `copyforward_window_zero_iff` — each one gate poly = 0 ↔ its local
relation). This file proves the missing WHOLE-DESCRIPTOR bridge: an assignment/trace SATISFYING the
emitted `dfaRoutingDesc` (via the deployed acceptance predicate `Satisfied2`) corresponds to a
GENUINE run of the pinned toggle automaton, and its exposed final-state public input equals
`classify(input)` — welded to the already-proven, `#assert_axioms`-clean semantic model
`Dregg2.Crypto.DfaAcceptanceAir` (`TableDfa`, `classify`, `lastNext_eq_classifyFrom`).

The pinned automaton is the descriptor's own toggle DFA: state/symbol on the grid `{0,1}`, transition
`step s y = s + y - 2·s·y` (the XOR interpolant `toggleInterp` that `transitionBody` pins). We
instantiate the model at `State = Sym = Digest = ℤ` and read a `Row` off each trace row's
`(current, symbol, next, entry_hash, running_hash)` columns.

## The terminal-step obligation (a REAL property of the deployed AIR, named honestly)

The deployed STARK divides EVERY per-row constraint by the TRANSITION zerofier
`Z_T = (xⁿ − 1)/(x − ωⁿ⁻¹)` (`circuit/src/stark.rs:20`, `:1108`), so the per-row toggle gate is
enforced on rows `0 … n−2` only — NOT the last row (this is the `when_transition` lowering; the Lean
`.base (.gate …)` denotation is faithful: `holdsVm … (.gate _)` is `True` on `isLast`). The last
row's `next` is pinned to the public `final_state` by the boundary constraint B2, and its
`(current, symbol, next)` triple is bound into the route commitment by the running-hash chip lookups
(the Poseidon2 half, `route_commitment_binds_trace`). So `final = classify(FULL input)` requires the
last row to ALSO be a genuine transition — an obligation the honest prover discharges but the gate
lowering does not re-assert. We name it as the explicit hypothesis `hterm` (exactly the transition
gate on the last row), and prove the whole bridge under it. Without `hterm` the state ENTERING the
last row is already forced to be the genuine classification of the consumed prefix — that fragment
needs no extra hypothesis (it is `htable`/`hcont`/`hhead`, established purely from `Satisfied2`).

## The field-faithful denotation (mod-p) and the canonicality envelope

`VmConstraint.holdsVm` / `WindowConstraint.holdsAt` pin gates only `≡ 0 [ZMOD p]`
(`p = 2013265921`, BabyBear) — the DEPLOYED field constraint, not an ℤ equality. Reading the ℤ
run back off the congruences needs the deployed range-check invariant carried as the EXPLICIT
hypothesis `DfaTraceCanon` (§3.5): the three DFA columns (`current`, `symbol`, `next`) canonical
in `[0, p)` on every row, and the two bound public inputs canonical. Under it the grid gates +
`p`'s primality force `current, symbol ∈ {0,1}` EXACTLY (not just mod `p`), and every congruence
collapses to the ℤ equality. Non-vacuous: `witTrace_canon` inhabits the envelope concretely.

## Non-vacuity

`witTrace` (§6): a concrete 2-row toggle run `IDLE=0 →1 1 →1 0` that PROVABLY `Satisfied2 dfaRoutingDesc`
AND satisfies `hterm`; feeding it the bridge recovers `final = 0 = classify (pinnedDfa 0) [1,1]`
(`witness_refines`). `badTrace`: the same run with row-0 `next` claiming the forbidden edge
`step(0,1)=0`, which PROVABLY fails `Satisfied2` (`badTrace_not_satisfied`) — the transition gate on
the non-last row rejects it. And `classify` genuinely discriminates (`classify [1,1] = 0 ≠ 1 =
classify [1]`), so the conclusion is not a constant.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The classification bridge is CRYPTO-FREE:
`air_final_state_is_classification`/`lastNext_eq_classifyFrom` use no hash carrier (the running-hash
Poseidon2 CR carrier `CollisionFree` is needed only for the SEPARATE binding half
`route_commitment_binds_trace`, and is NOT consumed here). NEW file; imports read-only.

reading honest. It is carried as the EXPLICIT hypothesis `DfaTraceCanon` — inhabited concretely by

/-- **`dfaRouting_refines_classify` — the Rung-1 functional-correctness refinement.**

A trace `t` that SATISFIES the emitted descriptor `dfaRoutingDesc` (via the deployed acceptance
predicate `Satisfied2`), is non-empty, and whose LAST row is also a genuine transition (`hterm`, the
terminal-step obligation the transition-zerofier lowering leaves to B2 + the route commitment), IS a
genuine run of the pinned toggle DFA:

  * every row is a real table transition (`next = step current symbol`);
  * the run starts at the public `initial_state`;
  * the exposed public `final_state` (`pi[PI_FINAL]`) equals `classify(input)` — the genuine
    deterministic classification of the trace's symbol column.

This is `air_run_is_table_run` / `air_final_state_is_classification` transported onto the EMITTED
descriptor's `Satisfied2` accept-set, via the per-gate teeth of `DfaRoutingEmit` and the pure model
lemma `lastNext_eq_classifyFrom`. No crypto carrier is consumed. -/

/-- **The genuine-run CORE, UNCONDITIONAL (no terminal hypothesis).** From `Satisfied2` + the
range-check canonicality envelope (no `hterm`) the descriptor forces: the run starts at `pi[initial_state]` (B1), every NON-LAST row is a genuine toggle
transition, and the state threads across each window (continuity). This is the largest fragment the
descriptor's transition-zerofier lowering forces without a terminal obligation; the exposed final PI
= `classify(FULL input)` additionally needs `hterm` (the last row's transition gate), because that
gate is by design not re-asserted on the last row (`dfaRouting_refines_classify`). -/
