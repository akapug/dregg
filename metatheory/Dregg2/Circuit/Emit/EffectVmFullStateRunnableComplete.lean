# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnableComplete — the GENERIC COMPLETENESS (`←`) leg + the
literal `⟺` for the WIDE full-state RUNNABLE descriptor, lifting the transfer completeness flagship
(`EffectVmEmitTransferComplete`) to the GENERIC `RunnableFullStateSpec St` engine.

## What the soundness engine gave and what this adds

`EffectVmFullStateRunnable.runnable_full_sound` is the SOUNDNESS half (`SAT ⟹ SEM`) over the generic
`RunnableFullStateSpec St`: a row satisfying the effect's WIDE runnable descriptor pins the FULL
17-field declarative post-state (`fullClause`), and `runnable_full_commit_binds` is the whole-state
anti-ghost. Both are generic — every kernel-only effect tag rides them as a THIN instance (only
`decodeFull`).

This file supplies the COMPLEMENTARY half — COMPLETENESS (`SEM ⟹ SAT`) — at the SAME resolution: an
engine that turns a genuine `fullClause` (plus the honest-witness precondition `absorbsTo`) into a row
that GENUINELY SATISFIES the wide descriptor on BOTH deployed windows, and welds the two directions
into the literal biconditional `runnable_full_commit_iff`. The value the engine adds over a bespoke
per-tag completeness proof (the reusable, discharged-once crypto):

  * **the Poseidon carrier is CONSTRUCTED generically** — `wide_sites_of_carrier`: a row whose three
    GROUP-4 inter-digest aux columns hold the genuine inner `H4`s and whose `state_commit` holds their
    `H4` with the `sysRootsDigestCol` carrier SATISFIES the four wide hash sites (`wideHashSites`). The
    per-tag builder only has to FILL those aux columns honestly (mechanical — copy transfer's `semLoc`
    aux block); the site-walk is discharged here, once.
  * **the commit is FORCED to the genuine wire commit** — `runnable_forces_genuine_commit` (= the base
    `wide_commit_eq` read as a function `wireCommitOfRow`): the last window's hash-site leg pins
    `state_commit` to the genuine `H4`-of-`H4` of the 13 absorbed kernel columns + the side-table
    carrier — the SAME GROUP-4 chain the deployed prover runs. No free digest survives; the commit
    conjunct of the `⟺` bites.
  * **the `⟺` is assembled generically** — `runnable_full_commit_iff`: `→` composes `runnable_full_sound`
    with the forced commit; `←` is `runnable_full_complete`.

## The `⟺` shape is HONEST (per the transfer flagship + the non-rev template)

The commit is GATE-forced (the GROUP-4 hash sites), so a per-row `↔` is genuine here — NOT a degenerate
per-trace iff, and NOT lookup-enforced. The completeness witness is not vacuously satisfiable: the
`fullClause` gates real per-cell content (the reference instance's clause is `CellTransferSpec ∧ frozen
roots`, refutable — `canary_tamper_breaks_clause`) and the commit forces the genuine absorption
(`canary_tamper_moves_commit`, `canary_bogus_commit_unsat`). The sole trust folds into the ONE named
carrier `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` (task #13's discharged Poseidon2 CR portal) — used
only where injectivity is invoked, never a fresh `axiom`.

## The reference instance + the demo

`transferRunnableCompleteSpec` is the VALIDATED REFERENCE `RunnableFullStateCompleteSpec CellState`:
its builder is transfer's `semTransferRow`, its completeness obligations project the (already proved)
`sem_transfer_satisfied`. `runnable_full_complete_demo` / `runnable_full_commit_iff_demo` discharge a
CONCRETE instance (`goodPre → demoPost`, `100 → 70`). Non-vacuous, both directions, canaried both ways.

## How a per-tag kernel-only instantiation looks (the follow-on fan is mechanical)

To amplify effect `X` to `air_accepts ⟺ spec` on the RUNNABLE descriptor, a farm task supplies a
`RunnableFullStateCompleteSpec` — the soundness `RunnableFullStateSpec` (already the standing pattern)
PLUS six completeness fields, all THIN because the crypto is discharged here:
  1. `buildRow`   — `X`'s witnessing row (`semLoc`-style column assignment; fill the aux GROUP-4 block
     as transfer does — the ONLY crypto touch, and `wide_sites_of_carrier` does the rest);
  2. `absorbsTo`  — `X`'s honest-witness precondition (the after-state's stored commit IS the genuine
     wire commit; the limbs are in range; the untouched roots are frozen) — the generic `hcommit`;
  3. `build_isRow` / `build_decode` — the row is an `X` row / decodes back (`X`'s `RowEncodes`);
  4. `build_carrier` — the aux GROUP-4 columns are honest (the `WideCarrier` predicate; mechanical);
  5. `build_active` / `build_last` / `build_ranges` — `X`'s per-row gates hold on the honest witness
     (the CONVERSE of `decodeFull` — `X`'s intent ⟹ its gates, e.g. transfer's `cellSpec_to_intent`
     ⟶ `transferVm_faithful.mpr`); this is `X`'s ONLY genuine per-tag proof obligation;
  6. `build_newcommit` — the row publishes `NEW_COMMIT = state_commit` (definitional).
Then `runnable_full_complete X` / `runnable_full_commit_iff X` fire with no new crypto.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} on every theorem. NEW file; all imports
read-only; `runnable_full_sound` / `runnable_full_commit_binds` / `sem_transfer_satisfied` are
UNCHANGED (used as-is).

`WideCarrier hash env` is the honest-fill shape of the four GROUP-4 columns: the three inter-digest aux
columns hold the genuine inner `H4`s of the after-state block, and `state_after.state_commit` holds
their `H4` with the `sysRootsDigestCol` side-table carrier. `wide_sites_of_carrier` turns that into
`siteHoldsAll hash env wideHashSites` — the per-tag completeness builder fills the aux columns and the
site-walk is proved HERE, generically (the de-transfer'd `sem_sites`). -/

/-- **`WideCarrier hash env`** — the row's GROUP-4 carrier columns are honestly filled. Its four
conjuncts are exactly the four wide hash sites' defining equations read off `env.loc`; a per-tag

obligations that the built row is an effect row / decodes / fills the GROUP-4 carrier / satisfies the
descriptor's gates + ranges on both windows / publishes `NEW_COMMIT = state_commit`. Only `build_active`

/-- **`canary_bogus_commit_unsat` — the constructed row is LOAD-BEARING (mutation direction).** A row
whose published `state_commit` is NOT the genuine `wireCommitOfRow` CANNOT hold the wide hash sites — so
a completeness witness with a wrong/removed GROUP-4 carrier REDS (the sites force the genuine commit).
The contrapositive of `runnable_forces_genuine_commit`: mutating the constructed commit breaks
`siteHoldsAll`, hence `satisfiedVm`, hence the `←` leg — the completeness construction is not vacuous. -/
