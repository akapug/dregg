# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnable — the MAGNESIUM core: the RUNNABLE EffectVM
descriptor binds the FULL post-state (all 17 `RecordKernelState` fields), per effect.

## The gap this module closes (the dominant Class-C disease)

`.docs-history-noclaude/rebuild/metatheory/_CIRCUIT-ASSURANCE-PER-EFFECT.md:42-62`: the deployed EffectVM row's `state_commit`
absorbs **exactly 13 state-block columns** (`bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, fields[0..7], cap_root` —
`EffectVmEmitTransferSound.absorbedCols`). It does **NOT** absorb the `system_roots` sub-block
(`auxCol SYSTEM_ROOTS_DIGEST = 186` is PAST `EFFECT_VM_WIDTH = 186` — the running prover carries no
such column), so every side-table effect (escrow / queue / nullifier / commitment / swiss /
sealedBox / delegation / refcount) is bound by the descriptor **only via a separate record-layer
commitment the row does not carry**. The per-effect files PROVE this gap
(`*_root_not_in_descriptor_commit`). That is the "pale ghost": a satisfying RUNNABLE proof pins a
projection, not the whole post-state.

This module SUPERSEDES that with a verified-by-construction WIDE descriptor + the GENERIC full-state
theorem on the RUNNABLE `EffectVmDescriptor` / `satisfiedVm` — the analog of the abstract
`StateCommit.transfer_circuit_full_sound` / `EffectCommit2.effect2_circuit_full_sound`, but for the
circuit the prover ACTUALLY RUNS. It is parametrized so a per-effect instance is THIN (a later farm
fills them; §RECIPE + the §WORKLIST name which effects need one).

## The two STAGE-4 widenings (both in `EffectVmEmit`, ADDITIVE)

  * **the column** (`sysRootsDigestCol = 186`): the dedicated, non-aliasing carrier for the
    after-state `Exec.SystemRoots.systemRootsDigest`, at the first column past the old width
    (`EFFECT_VM_WIDTH_SYSROOTS = 188`). Backward-compatible: `EFFECT_VM_WIDTH = 186` is UNCHANGED, so
    every 186-wide descriptor still builds (it just leaves col `186`/`187` unpopulated).
  * **the absorb site** (`sysRootsAbsorbSite`): the GROUP-4 site `H4(inter1, inter2, inter3,
    sysRootsDigestCol)` — transfer's spare `.zero` 4th slot REPLACED by the carrier, so the published
    `state_commit` absorbs the side-table digest.

## What is PROVEN here (l4v bar — genuine)

  * **§1 `wideHashSites` + `wideCommit_binds_everything`** — under `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`, a row
    satisfying the wide hash-sites whose published `state_commit` is fixed has BOTH (a) its 13
    absorbed state-block columns AND (b) its `sysRootsDigestCol` carrier uniquely determined. This is
    `EffectVmEmitTransferSound.absorbed_determined_by_commit_or_collides` EXTENDED to the 4th absorbed slot (the
    `system_roots` digest), proved by peeling the outer Poseidon CR one more position.

  * **§2 `wide_binds_systemRoots_or_collides`** — chaining (b) with the roots-digest peel: two wide
    rows publishing the SAME `state_commit`, whose carriers ARE the `systemRootsDigest` of their
    respective `SysRoots` sub-blocks, EITHER agree on EVERY side-table root (escrow / nullifier / …)
    OR exhibit a genuine sponge collision at the two ordered root lists. So the RUNNABLE commitment
    binds the whole `system_roots` state — the gap is closed, and without the false injective floor
    the old version of this leg borrowed from `Exec.SystemRoots`.

  * **§3 `RunnableFullStateSpec` + `runnable_full_sound`** — the GENERIC crown jewel. A satisfying wide
    descriptor pins the FULL 17-field declarative post-state (`fullClause`): the per-cell state block
    (binding `cell`/`caps`/`bal`-of-this-cell + the frame), AND the 8 side-table roots
    (`escrows`/`nullifiers`/`commitments`/`queues`/`swiss`/`sealedBoxes`/refcount/`delegations`), AND
    the named residual carriers (`slotCaveats`/`factories`/`lifecycle`/`deathCert`/`delegate` ride the
    per-cell value's `restLimbs`, bound by `CommitmentCrossBind.LeafIsCellCommit`). The per-effect
    DECODE is the only thin obligation (`decodeFull`).

  * **§4 anti-ghost** — tampering ANY absorbed state-block column
    (`wide_rejects_state_tamper_or_collides`) OR any `system_roots` root
    (`wide_rejects_root_tamper_or_collides`) forces two same-`NEW_COMMIT` rows to EXHIBIT a genuine
    sponge collision at an extracted pair. The whole-state tooth bites on all 17 — and now names the
    price a forger pays instead of assuming it away.

  * **§5 non-vacuity** — concrete wide rows: an honest one and a forged one (tampered side-table root)
    whose published commitments cannot coincide under CR; positive + negative `#guard`s, no
    `native_decide`.

## The terminal (named — and the carrier is GONE from the keystones)

⚑ **THE CARRIER WAS FALSE, AND IT HAS BEEN REMOVED.** This file used to fold its whole anti-ghost
story into ONE named carrier, `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` — injectivity of the sponge.
That is FALSE at the deployed BabyBear parameters: `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`
proves it by pigeonhole (an infinite `List ℤ` domain into a bounded field). So `wide_binds_everything`,
`wide_binds_systemRoots`, `runnable_full_commit_binds` and both `wide_rejects_*_tamper` teeth were
VACUOUSLY TRUE exactly where they were supposed to bind the deployed system, and so were their ~17
per-tag instantiations. They are DELETED — not kept beside the new forms, which would be the same sin
in additive dress.

The replacement assumes NOTHING. The GROUP-4 peel and the roots peel are TOTAL FUNCTIONS
(`Poseidon2Binding.group4Find`, reused rather than re-authored) that either prove the binding or hand
back the SPECIFIC pair of lists at which the deployed sponge collides. Every keystone below concludes
`binding ∨ WideColl … ∨ RootsColl …`. As FORMULAS these are weaker; as CONTENT AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS
they are strictly stronger, because the deleted premise is unsatisfiable by the real sponge — the old
theorems said nothing about the deployed system and these hold OF it. The `_of_injective` bridges
recover each deleted statement as exactly its injective special case, so nothing genuinely proved was
given up.

⚑ **THAT NAMED RESIDUAL IS NOW CLOSED (07-20).** `Exec.SystemRoots.systemRootsDigest_binds_pointwise`
carried the SAME defect (`compressNInjective` = `Poseidon2SpongeCR`) one level down, with consumers
across the note/delegation emit families. A follow-on lane deleted it and its `_binds`/`_binds_fn`
siblings and the `cellCommitS_binds_*` commitment teeth, rewiring all four consumers onto extraction-
as-data. The roots-leg spine (`systemRootsDigest_eq_hash_rootList`, `rootsCollFind`, `RootsColl`,
`rootsColl_irrefl`) MOVED to `Exec.SystemRoots` — its natural home beside `rootList` — and is `export`ed
below, so this file and its downstream tags read the one canonical definition instead of a parallel copy.

/-! ## §0 — THE 17-FIELD CENSUS: where each `RecordKernelState` field is pinned by the WIDE descriptor.

The deliverable is FULL-state: the runnable `state_commit` binds all 17 `RecordKernelState` fields.
The honest mapping (no over-claim — the ARGUS one-disease census discipline), per `(pre, post)` cell
transition on a single WIDE row:

  | # | field          | pinned by                                                                  |
  |---|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | 1 | `cell` (this)  | the per-cell state block (`bal_lo/hi, nonce, fields[0..7]+FIELDS_ROOT, cap_root, reserved`) — absorbed scalar cols, determined-by-commit (§1) |
  | 2 | `caps`         | the `cap_root` column (absorbed, §1)                                        |
  | 3 | `bal` (this)   | this cell's `balance` (= `bal_lo/bal_hi`), absorbed (§1)                    |
  | 4 | `escrows`      | `system_roots[ESCROW]` digest — absorbed via `sysRootsAbsorbSite` (§1/§2)   |
  | 5 | `nullifiers`   | `system_roots[NULLIFIER]` (§2)                                             |
  | 6 | `commitments`  | `system_roots[COMMIT]` (§2)                                                |
  | 7 | `queues`       | `system_roots[QUEUE]` (§2)                                                 |
  | 8 | `swiss`        | `system_roots[STURDYREF]` (§2)                                            |
  | 9 | `sealedBoxes`  | `system_roots[SEALED_BOXES]` (§2)                                         |
  |10 | `delegations`  | `system_roots[DELEG]` (§2)                                                |
  |11 | `revoked`      | `system_roots[DELEG]` (the revoke-delegation epoch — `SystemRoots.systemRoot.DELEG` docstring) (§2) |
  |12 | refcount (GC)  | `system_roots[REFCOUNT]` (§2) — the `dropRef` GC counter                   |
  |13 | `slotCaveats`  | rides this cell's `Value` `restLimbs` (bound via `CommitmentCrossBind.LeafIsCellCommit` — the per-cell leaf IS the canonical commitment) |
  |14 | `factories`    | rides `restLimbs` (as #13)                                                 |
  |15 | `lifecycle`    | rides `restLimbs` (as #13)                                                 |
  |16 | `deathCert`    | rides `restLimbs` (as #13)                                                 |
  |17 | `delegate`     | rides `restLimbs` (as #13)                                                 |
  | + | `accounts`     | the live-cell SET — the CROSS-CELL membership, bound at the TURN-COMPOSITION layer (`Dregg2.Circuit.TurnEmit`), NOT this single-row descriptor (the `EffectVmEmitTransferSound` "PER-CELL, not cross-cell" boundary). Named, not claimed here. |

So fields 1–3 are absorbed scalar columns; 4–12 are the 8 side-table roots (this STAGE-4 widening's
new binding); 13–17 ride the per-cell `Value` (the named `restLimbs` factoring, an R2-style refinement,
not a soundness gap); `accounts` is the explicitly-deferred turn-layer cross-cell fact. A per-effect
`fullClause` (below) asserts exactly the subset of these its effect MOVES, with the rest FROZEN. -/

/-! ## §1 — the WIDE hash-site shape + the FULL commitment-binding (13 cols + the side-table digest).

The wide descriptor's hash-sites are transfer's three INNER sites (binding `bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce,
fields[0..7], cap_root`) plus `sysRootsAbsorbSite` (binding the `sysRootsDigestCol` carrier into the
4th slot of the outer `H4`). So the published `state_commit` is the genuine H4-of-H4 digest of the 13
absorbed columns AND the `system_roots` digest. -/

/-- **`wideHashSites`** — the GROUP-4 site list of a WIDE (`system_roots`-absorbing) descriptor:
transfer's `site0/site1/site2` (the inner H4s over the 13 absorbed state-block columns) ++ the
extension site that absorbs `sysRootsDigestCol` into the published `state_commit`. The site ORDER is
load-bearing (the extension site reads `.digest 0/1/2`). -/
def wideHashSites : List VmHashSite :=
  [ site0, site1, site2, sysRootsAbsorbSite (saCol state.STATE_COMMIT) ]

/-- **`baseAbsorbedCols`** — the 12 inner-site absorbed columns (`bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, fields[0..7],
cap_root`), WITHOUT the deployed-track `record_digest` 13th limb. The WIDE descriptor's GROUP-4 4th
input is the `sysRootsDigestCol` carrier (NOT `record_digest`, which the wide layout does not absorb),
so the wide commitment binds exactly these 12 columns plus the side-table digest. (`absorbedCols` —
the deployed-track 13-list — absorbs `record_digest` at its 4th outer slot instead; the two tracks
diverge only in that 4th GROUP-4 input.) -/
def baseAbsorbedCols (env : VmRowEnv) : List ℤ :=
  [ env.loc (saCol state.BALANCE_LO), env.loc (saCol state.BALANCE_HI), env.loc (saCol state.NONCE)

  , env.loc (saCol (state.FIELD_BASE + 7)), env.loc (saCol state.CAP_ROOT) ]

/-- **`wideCommitOf`** — the wide commitment as a direct scalar function: `H4(H4(bal_lo,bal_hi,nonce,
fld0), H4(fld1..4), H4(fld5,fld6,fld7,cap), sysDig)` — exactly `commitOf` but with the 4th outer slot
the `system_roots` digest instead of the literal `0`. Computes by `rfl` (no list match). -/

/-! ### §1½ — the absorbed block decomposition + the EXTRACTION-AS-DATA anti-ghost.

⚑ **WHAT CHANGED AND WHY.** The keystone here used to be `wide_binds_everything`, carrying
`Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`. That hypothesis is FALSE at the deployed BabyBear parameters
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`: the sponge maps the infinite `List ℤ` into a
bounded field, so it collides by pigeonhole), so the theorem — and with it every anti-ghost claim in
this file and its ~17 per-tag instantiations — said NOTHING about the deployed system. It has been
DELETED, not kept beside the new form.

What replaces it assumes nothing. The GROUP-4 peel is written as a TOTAL FUNCTION
(`Poseidon2Binding.group4Find`) that either proves the absorbed blocks equal or LANDS on the specific
pair of lists at which the deployed sponge actually collides, and hands that pair back as DATA.
Consumers carry `binding ∨ WideColl …` — a disjunction that is TRUE of the deployed sponge, where the
injective form was empty. -/

/-- **`WideColl hash e₁ e₂`** — the pair the extractor returned is a GENUINE collision of the deployed
sponge. The named disjunct every cured keystone below carries in place of the deleted floor.
Deliberately NOT `∃ a collision`, which pigeonhole makes unconditionally true and which would bind
nothing. -/

wide rows whose published `state_commit`s are EQUAL EITHER agree on ALL 12 absorbed state-block columns
AND on the `sysRootsDigestCol` carrier, OR exhibit a genuine collision of the deployed sponge at the
two lists `wideCollFind` returns.

⚑ **STRENGTH, stated honestly.** The old form concluded a bare conjunction from `Poseidon2SpongeCR
hash`, which the deployed sponge REFUTES; at deployed parameters it was vacuous. This one is a
disjunction — formally weaker, but it HOLDS of the deployed sponge, which the old one did not. Nothing
that was genuinely proved has been given up (`wide_binds_everything_of_injective` recovers the old
statement as exactly the injective special case). -/

needs DISTINCT inputs, and the extractor fed a row against ITSELF returns a pair of identical lists.

hypothesis anywhere.

This is what lets a non-vacuity witness for the cured keystones be discharged HONESTLY. The previous
audit witness (`Verify.KeystoneAuditSystemRoots`) had to satisfy `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and did so with
the toy `encodeSponge` — precisely the "FALSE COMFORT" `HashFloorHonesty`'s header calls out, since
that sponge injects into ALL of `ℤ` while the real compressing Poseidon2 refutes the floor. No toy
sponge is needed now. -/

/-! ## §2 — the `system_roots` sub-block bound BY the RUNNABLE commitment.

Chaining §1's carrier-binding with the roots-digest peel (`systemRootsDigest_eq_hash_rootList` + the
SAME extraction spine, now shared with the cured
`Exec.SystemRoots.systemRootsDigest_binds_pointwise_or_collides`): when each wide row's `sysRootsDigestCol` IS the `systemRootsDigest` of a
`SysRoots` sub-block, two rows publishing the same `state_commit` agree on every side-table root. So
the RUNNABLE descriptor — the circuit the prover runs — binds the whole side-table state, not a
record-layer commitment off to the side. -/

/-! The roots leg's spine now lives at its natural home, `Exec.SystemRoots` — beside `rootList` and the
digest it peels, where the SAME repair cured `systemRootsDigest_binds_*` (07-20). `export`ed here rather
than re-declared so there is exactly ONE `RootsColl` in the tree and the ~40 per-tag wide keystones that
`open …EffectVmFullStateRunnable (RootsColl)` keep resolving to it. -/

sub-block). The chain: equal commitment ⇒ equal carrier (`wide_binds_everything`) ⇒ equal digest ⇒
equal roots pointwise, or a named collision. Tampering ONLY a side-table root (a
dropped escrow, an omitted nullifier) provably MOVES `state_commit` ⇒ UNSAT against the published

/-! ## §3 — the GENERIC FULL-STATE-ON-RUNNABLE crown jewel.

`RunnableFullStateSpec St` is the per-effect data (the analog of `EffectCommit2.EffectSpec2`, but over
the RUNNABLE `EffectVmDescriptor`/`satisfiedVm`):

  * `descriptor`  — the effect's WIDE runnable descriptor (declares `EFFECT_VM_WIDTH_SYSROOTS`, its
    `hashSites = wideHashSites`, and the per-row gates encoding the effect's transition).
  * `isRow`       — the row-shape hypothesis (`s_effect = 1`, `s_noop = 0`), the analog of
    `IsTransferRow`.
  * `decodeAfter` — the structured decode of the row's `state_after` block + carrier into the post
    `(CellState × SysRoots)` (the `RowEncodes`-style relation, pinning each column).
  * `fullClause`  — the DECLARATIVE full post-state predicate the effect demands of `(pre, post)` over
    the per-cell `CellState` AND the 8 side-table roots (ALL 17 `RecordKernelState` fields' content,
    via: the per-cell block for `cell`/`caps`/`bal`-here + frame; the 8 roots for the side tables;
    `restLimbs` for the named residual carriers).
  * `decodeFull`  — THE THIN per-effect obligation: the per-row gates + the structured decode entail
    `fullClause`. (For the transfer family this is `transferDescriptor_full_sound`'s body; for a
    side-table effect it is the root-update gate's faithfulness + the frame freeze. A later farm fills
    one per effect — see the §WORKLIST.) -/

/-- The per-effect data for a FULL-state RUNNABLE descriptor. `St` is the effect's abstract pre/post
state carrier (e.g. `CellState`, or a richer record); `decodeAfter`/`fullClause` are stated over it +
the 8 side-table roots, so the spec pins the WHOLE 17-field post-state. -/
structure RunnableFullStateSpec (St : Type) where
  /-- The effect's WIDE runnable descriptor (`hashSites = wideHashSites`, width
  `EFFECT_VM_WIDTH_SYSROOTS`). -/

  /-- The descriptor's hash-sites ARE the `system_roots`-absorbing wide sites (so its `state_commit`
  binds the 13 absorbed columns + the side-table digest). -/

  /-- The row-shape hypothesis (the effect's selector hot, NoOp cold). -/
  isRow        : VmRowEnv → Prop
  /-- The structured decode of the row into `(pre, post, postRoots)`: the `state_before`/`state_after`
  columns are `pre`/`post`, the carrier `sysRootsDigestCol` is `systemRootsDigest postRoots`, and the
  published `NEW_COMMIT` is the after-`state_commit`. -/

  /-- The DECLARATIVE full post-state predicate (all 17 fields' content for THIS effect). -/
  fullClause   : St → St → SysRoots → Prop
  /-- THE THIN per-effect obligation: the satisfied per-row gates + the decode entail the full clause.
  The gate content is taken at the ACTIVE row (`isLast = false`): the deployed gates run under
  `builder.when_transition()`, so they bind on every row but the last; the active effect row is a
  transition row. (A `true true` single-row window — the wrap row — does NOT bind the gates.) -/

                   fullClause pre post sr

/-- **`runnable_full_sound` — THE GENERIC CROWN JEWEL.** A row satisfying the effect's WIDE runnable
descriptor (`satisfiedVm`, first/last active), under the structured decode, pins the FULL 17-field
declarative post-state (`fullClause`). The per-row gates give the effect's transition; the WIDE
hash-sites bind it (and the side-table roots) into the published `state_commit`. This is the analog of
`EffectCommit2.effect2_circuit_full_sound`, but for the circuit the prover ACTUALLY RUNS
(`satisfiedVm <EffectVmDescriptor>`). Per-effect: only `decodeFull` is supplied (THIN). -/

/-- **`runnable_full_commit_binds` — the whole-state anti-ghost over the WIDE commitment.** Two rows
satisfying the effect's wide descriptor that publish the SAME `NEW_COMMIT`, and whose carriers ARE the
`systemRootsDigest` of their post sub-blocks, agree on EVERY absorbed state-block column AND every
side-table root. So a prover CANNOT keep `NEW_COMMIT` while tampering ANY of the 17 fields' bound
content — the runnable descriptor binds the whole post-state, not a projection. (Requires the decode's
`NEW_COMMIT = after-state_commit` link, supplied as `hpin₁`/`hpin₂`.) -/

/-! ## §3½ — THE VALIDATED REFERENCE INSTANCE (transfer): `decodeFull` is REAL, `fullClause` non-vacuous.

Before any per-effect farm, ember's bar is a VALIDATED REFERENCE: a CONCRETE instance proving the
generic framework is non-vacuous — `decodeFull` discharged from GENUINE per-row faithfulness (NOT a
`fullClause := True` ghost), with a real declarative full clause inhabited by a real transfer. This is
that reference (the transfer family). It is also the TEMPLATE the §RECIPE points a farm at.

Transfer touches NO side-table, so its `system_roots` sub-block is FROZEN: the full clause is the
per-cell `CellTransferSpec` (balance moved, frame frozen) AND `postRoots = preRoots`. The wide
descriptor reuses transfer's per-row gates verbatim (so `decodeFull` projects them to
`transferDescriptor_full_sound`'s body) and swaps in `wideHashSites` (so the published commitment now
absorbs the — frozen — side-table digest). -/

hash-site layer DROPPED — the per-cell move/freeze factors through `transferVm_faithful`
(`transferRowGates ⟺ TransferRowIntent`) + `intent_to_cellSpec`, NEITHER of which reads the sites. So
the runnable per-cell soundness depends ONLY on the gates (the sites bind the COMMITMENT — §1/§4 —
not the per-cell spec). -/

Concrete computable witnesses over a toy injective Horner sponge (the same shape the sibling guards
use). An honest wide row carries `systemRootsDigest emptySystemRoots`; a forged one carries the digest
of a POPULATED sub-block. We prove their `system_roots` carriers DIFFER (so a shared-commitment
satisfaction is impossible under CR), and that the empty digest is the fixed cell-independent constant.
No `native_decide`. -/

/-- The toy injective Horner sponge (length folded in — NOT `List.sum`). A realizable `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
witness on the `#guard` domain. -/
def hC : List ℤ → ℤ := fun xs => xs.foldl (fun acc x => acc * 1000003 + x) (xs.length : ℤ)

  else if i = (⟨Dregg2.Exec.SystemRoots.systemRoot.NULLIFIER, by decide⟩ : Fin N_SYSTEM_ROOTS) then 42
  else 0

/-! NON-VACUITY (carriers DIFFER): the empty sub-block's digest ≠ the populated sub-block's digest.
So an honest row (`emptySystemRoots` carrier) and a forged row (`populatedRoots` carrier) have DISTINCT
`sysRootsDigestCol` carriers — under CR no single `state_commit` can absorb both, i.e. the side-table
tamper is rejected by the wide commitment (the §4 tooth, concretely). -/
#guard decide (systemRootsDigest hC emptySystemRoots = systemRootsDigest hC populatedRoots) == false

/-! ## §6 — THE PER-EFFECT AMPLIFICATION RECIPE (how a later farm fills a THIN instance).

To amplify effect `X` from Class C (descriptor binds a projection) to full-state on the RUNNABLE
descriptor, a farm task supplies a `RunnableFullStateSpec`:

  1. **the wide descriptor** `xVmDescriptorWide`: take `X`'s existing 186-wide descriptor, set
     `traceWidth := EFFECT_VM_WIDTH_SYSROOTS`, `hashSites := wideHashSites` (so `usesWideSites := rfl`),
     and (for a side-table effect) add the root-UPDATE gate `gXRootUpdate` pinning
     `sysRootsDigestCol = sysRootsDigestColBefore + step` (the accumulator step the prepended/removed
     record contributes), exactly as `EffectVmEmitCreateEscrow.gEscrowRootUpdate` does — but now over
     the DEDICATED, non-aliasing carrier `sysRootsDigestCol`, not the raw `96`.
  2. **`isRow`** := `X`'s `IsXRow` (selector hot / NoOp cold), as `EffectVmEmitTransfer.IsTransferRow`.
  3. **`decodeAfter`** := `X`'s `RowEncodes`-style relation, EXTENDED with
     `env.loc sysRootsDigestCol = systemRootsDigest postRoots` and `env.pub NEW_COMMIT =
     after-state_commit`.
  4. **`fullClause`** := the declarative 17-field post for `X` (the per-cell block freeze/move + the
     touched side-table root advance + the untouched roots frozen).
  5. **`decodeFull`** := the THIN proof: project the per-row gates (a sublist of the wide descriptor's
     constraints) to `X`'s row-intent (already proved, e.g. `createEscrowFull_forces_intent` /
     `_forces_root`), then decode to `fullClause` (e.g. `intent_to_cellCreateSpec`). For the transfer
     family this is `transferDescriptor_full_sound`'s body verbatim.

The crypto is DISCHARGED once here (`wide_binds_everything` + `wide_binds_systemRoots`); a per-effect
instance carries NO new portal — only the (already proved) per-row faithfulness + the decode. The
anti-ghost (§4) is then `runnable_full_commit_binds` instantiated at `X`'s spec.

## §7 — THE WORKLIST (which effects need the per-effect instance; for a later farm).

Source of truth for the current class: `.docs-history-noclaude/rebuild/metatheory/_CIRCUIT-ASSURANCE-PER-EFFECT.md` THE LEDGER.

  * **Already FULL on the per-cell block (instance is near-trivial — `fullClause` is the per-cell
    spec, no side-table root):** transfer, mint, burn, incrementNonce. (Class A; `decodeFull` =
    their `*Descriptor_full_sound`.)

  * **Side-table effects — NEED the wide descriptor + root-update gate + instance (the bulk of the
    work; the carrier moves off the raw `96`/the out-of-bounds `auxCol 96` onto `sysRootsDigestCol`):**
      - escrow family: createEscrow, createCommittedEscrow, refundEscrow, releaseEscrow
        (root index `ESCROW`);
      - bridge family: bridgeLock, bridgeMint, bridgeFinalize, bridgeCancel (escrow/bridge root —
        these currently PROVE `*_root_not_in_descriptor_commit`, the exact gap this closes);
      - note family: noteCreate (`COMMIT` root), noteSpend / noteSpendCompose (`NULLIFIER` root);
      - queue family: queueAllocate, queueEnqueue, queueDequeue, queueResize, queuePipelineStep,
        queueAtomicTx, pipelinedSend (`QUEUE` root; enqueue already binds via `fields[4]` — migrate to
        the dedicated carrier);
      - swiss family: swissExport, swissEnliven, swissHandoff, swissDrop, validateHandoff
        (`STURDYREF` root);
      - sealed-box family: seal, unseal, createSealPair, cellSeal, cellUnseal (`SEALED_BOXES` root);
      - delegation family: delegate, delegateAtten, refreshDelegation, revokeDelegation
        (`DELEG` root + the `cap_root` column — the cap-table membership stays opaque, named);
      - dropRef (`REFCOUNT` root).

  * **Cap-table-only effects (the `cap_root` column is absorbed; `fullClause` binds the column, the
    cap-graph membership stays the named opaque digest — a refinement, not a soundness gap):**
    attenuate, introduce, setPermissions, setVK, exercise, makeSovereign, spawn,
    createCell, createCellFromFactory.

  * **Frame-only / log-only (NO side-table root; `fullClause` = frame freeze + the per-cell block):**
    noop, emitEvent, receiptArchive, refusal, setField (the `fields_root`/`FIELDS_ROOT` carrier is the
    per-cell value's; bound via the per-cell block + `CommitmentCrossBind`), cellDestroy.

Each family shares ONE root index and ONE root-update-gate shape, so a farm fills a family at a time
(the escrow family is the validated reference — `EffectVmEmitCreateEscrow` already has the gate +
the `_binds_escrow_root` connector; re-target its `SYS_DIG_AFTER` onto `sysRootsDigestCol` and lift
through this generic `RunnableFullStateSpec`).
