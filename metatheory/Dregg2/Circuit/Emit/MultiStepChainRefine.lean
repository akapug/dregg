# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MultiStepChainRefine — the WHOLE-DESCRIPTOR functional-correctness bridge for
the MULTI-STEP derivation-chaining composition (`MultiStepChainEmit.multiStepChainDesc`).

## What Rung-0 already proved (in `MultiStepChainEmit.lean`)
`multiStepChainDesc` is byte-pinned to the deployed wire, and its continuity window has a LOCAL
soundness lemma (`continuity_zero_iff` : the window body vanishes iff `nxt[PREV] = loc[ACC]`). What was
MISSING: the whole-descriptor bridge — that a trace SATISFYING the descriptor (`Satisfied2`)
corresponds to the genuine semantic relation the chain circuit computes.

## What THIS file proves (Rung-1)
The census dossier for `multi_step` is `spec_status = NO_LEAN`: no proven semantic model existed for
the CHAINING semantics. So this file FIRST authors the missing functional spec — the genuine relation
the multi-step composition is meant to compute — then proves the emitted descriptor refines it
(SAT ⟹ SEM, the load-bearing soundness direction).

### The semantic relation (authored here): the Merkle–Damgård accumulated-hash chain
`chainFold hash initial [d₀,…,d_{K-1}]` = `foldl (fun acc d => hash [acc, d]) initial [d₀,…,d_{K-1}]`
— the running left-fold that starts at `initial_state_root` and absorbs each step's `derived_hash`
by `hash_2_to_1(acc, derived)`. This IS the chaining producer
(`circuit/src/multi_step_air.rs::compute_accumulated_hashes`): `prev₀ = initial`,
`accᵢ = hash_2_to_1(prevᵢ, derivedᵢ)`, `prevᵢ₊₁ = accᵢ`, `final = acc_last`.

### The bridge (whole descriptor, not one gate)
`multiStepChain_refines_chainFold` (SAT ⟹ SEM): a trace that SATISFIES the whole `multiStepChainDesc`
against the NAMED Poseidon2 chip-lookup soundness carrier `ChipTableSound hash (t.tf .poseidon2)`
forces its published tail PI to be the genuine chain fold of the published head PI over the trace's
`derived_hash` column:

    t.pub FINAL_PI = chainFold hash (t.pub INITIAL_PI) (traceDeriveds t).

It COMPOSES all four constraint families over ALL rows: the per-row `hash_2_to_1` absorb (MS1, the chip
lookup + the lever `chip_lookup_sound`), the transition continuity (MS2, the window), and the two
boundary PI pins (MS3, `initPin`/`finalPin`) — assembled by induction over the row count. This is the
whole descriptor's chaining semantics, not a single-gate restatement.

### Non-vacuity (the anti-scar proof)
`wTrace_satisfied2` builds a CONCRETE one-row trace + a concrete chip table + `hash = 0` for which
`Satisfied2` genuinely holds AND `ChipTableSound` holds — the hypothesis chain is inhabited;
`witness_spec` fires the bridge end-to-end on it. `badCont_rejects` and `badAbsorb_rejects` exhibit
CONCRETE traces that FAIL `Satisfied2` because a constraint BITES: an unlinked chain
(`nxt[PREV] ≠ loc[ACC]`) trips the MS2 continuity window, and an empty chip table makes the MS1 absorb
lookup unsatisfiable — so neither the continuity gate nor the hash-binding lookup is decorative.

### Honest residuals (NAMED, not laundered)
The per-derivation single-step constraints (Datalog body membership, head binding, range proofs) are
the SIBLING `derivation` family — `DERIVED` here is that circuit's published `derived_hash` column,
taken as a free per-row input at the chain layer (exactly the split the emit file's `## Residuals`
records). MS4 conclusion-decode and POLICY_ROOT are likewise not emitted at this layer.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The SOLE cryptographic carrier is the
NAMED Poseidon2 chip-lookup soundness `ChipTableSound hash (t.tf .poseidon2)` (the deployed chip AIR's
own faithfulness — the same carrier `chip_lookup_sound` rides); `hash` is a parameter, and the carrier
enters only as an explicit hypothesis, never an axiom. NEW file; imports read-only.

each step's `derived_hash` into the running accumulator by `hash_2_to_1(acc, derived) = hash [acc, d]`,
from the `initial_state_root`. The Lean twin of the deployed producer
`MultiStepWitness::compute_accumulated_hashes`. -/

/-! ## §2b — the field-faithful mod-`p` envelope.

Under the deployed denotation the continuity window and the two PI pins bind only CONGRUENCES
(`≡ [ZMOD p]`, `p` the BabyBear prime). A chain accumulator is re-hashed at the next step, so a mod-`p`
congruence on `PREV`/`ACC` cannot thread through the abstract `hash` — we recover the genuine ℤ
equalities from the DEPLOYED range-check canonicality (`0 ≤ cell < p`) of the stored spine columns
(`PREV`/`ACC` on every row, and the head/tail PIs). The absorb lemma (MS1) rides `chip_lookup_sound`
directly, so it is a genuine equality already; only MS2/MS3 need this lift. Inhabited by `wMscCanon`. -/

`chipRow`, so `ChipTableSound` holds. This is a REAL satisfying trace, not a scar: `witness_spec` fires
the whole bridge end-to-end on it, and the failing traces show teeth that BITE. -/
