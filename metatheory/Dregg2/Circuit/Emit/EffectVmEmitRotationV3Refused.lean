# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitRotationV3Refused — the FLAG-DAY welded cohort.

The VK-EPOCH flag-day welds the DEPLOYED three-block capacity-floor refuse (escrow 17 / discharge 18 /
vault 19) onto every bare cohort member so the DEPLOYED VK bytes REFUSE a declared-capacity dodge, not
just the Lean keystone. This module is DOWNSTREAM of both `EffectVmEmitRotationV3` (the bare cohort +
`withDfaRcPins`) and `Dregg2.Deos.BareCohortFloorRefuseDeployed` (`gentianDeployedBareRefuse` + its
proven soundness), which resolves the import cycle (`BareCohortFloorRefuseDeployed` transitively imports
`EffectVmEmitRotationV3`, so the weld cannot live inside `v3Registry`'s def).

`v3RegistryRefused` maps `withDfaRcPins ∘ gentianDeployedBareRefuse` over `v3RegistryBare`: refuse FIRST
(widens `traceWidth` 1581→1626, appends the 39 refuse gates), then the uniform dsl rc-EMIT `withDfaRcPins`
(width-invariant, +4 tail PIs). So each welded member has `traceWidth = 1626`, `piCount = bare + 4`, and
constraints `bare ++ deployedRefuseGates ++ rcPins`. The apex re-keys `v3RegistryCapOpen` over THIS list;
the per-effect soundness rungs peel the weld (`satisfied2_of_withDfaRcPins` then
`satisfied2_of_gentianDeployedBareRefuse`) back to the bare face they are stated at. The anti-launder
proof is `BareCohortFloorRefuseDeployed.declared_capacity_unsat_deployed`: a declared-capacity turn is
UNSAT under `gentianDeployedBareRefuse d` for ANY bare `d`, so it is UNSAT under every welded cohort
member (the peel preserves the refuse block's membership).

/-! ## §VALUE8 — THE STAGED setField VALUE8 EPOCH (`v3RegistrySetFieldValue8`).

The deployed setField members ride `withDfaRcPins (gentianDeployedBareRefuse (withSelectorGate SEL_SET_FIELD
(v3OfFrozen (setFieldTickFace slot))))` — the freeze-ALL wrap, which REJECTS an honest large-value write
(the R1 completeness seam) and leaves the written slot's high 224 bits unbound in the light-client view.

The VALUE8 epoch swaps the inner freeze-ALL for freeze-EXCEPT (`setFieldV3 slot = v3OfFrozenSetField slot
(setFieldTickFace slot)`) — freeing the written slot's 7 completion lanes so a large write is no longer
over-frozen — and rides `withSetFieldCompletionPins slot` ON THE gentian-WIDENED face (the after-block
completion columns `EFFECT_VM_WIDTH + AFTER_BLOCK_OFF + (113 + 7·slot + k)` are BELOW the caveat region
gentian widens, so they are byte-stable through the weld), pinning those 7 freed lanes to 7 TAIL PIs
(the declared value8). rc rides OUTERMOST exactly as the deployed member. Result: `traceWidth = 1692`
(drop-in with the deployed setField member) and `piCount = 57` (46 rotated prefix + 7 value8 + 4 rc).

ADDITIVE / STAGED: a NEW set BESIDE `v3RegistryRefused`; the live `rotation-v3-staged-registry.tsv` / VK
are byte-untouched. Adoption is a controlled epoch re-point (one-tx, non-destructive — old epochs stay
verifiable). The per-effect setField soundness rungs peel this weld exactly as `satisfied2_of_v3RefusedMember`
plus `satisfied2_of_withSetFieldCompletionPins` (an appended `.piBinding` cohort). -/
