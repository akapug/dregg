# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitCapReshape — the OPENABLE `capability_root` (the ARGUS linchpin).

The cap-reshape crown (#103): an OPENABLE `capability_root` — a sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle commitment
over a cell's HELD capabilities — so the circuit can witness, IN-CIRCUIT, the two capability-security
properties a light client must trust WITHOUT re-running history:

  (a) **non-amplification** — a granted cap is `≤` a held cap: an OPENING of the parent's held cap
      proves the parent holds at least what it confers, so a grant cannot amplify authority;
  (b) **production-authority** — a mint/production is gated on HOLDING the issuer's capability: the
      production effect OPENS the issuer-cap it requires from the producer's held-set root. Authority
      is PRODUCTION under non-forgeability (`unsealer ⊗ sealed ⊢ contents`, mint/powerbox), NOT affine
      descent — the constructive-knowledge correction (`CONSTRUCTIVE-KNOWLEDGE.md` §3): "only
      connectivity begets connectivity" = epistemic non-forgeability (generative acts authorized-BY-HELD
      + receipt-disclosed), never weakening-only. We NEVER re-make the §3 affine error.

## What "openable" means here, and why this is NOT a re-invention

`EffectVmEmitCapRoot` advances `cap_root` as a prepend-accumulator DIGEST (Phase A) and explicitly
defers the genuine sorted-tree OPEN ("Phase E, out of scope here"). `EffectVmEmitV2.attenuateV2_non_amp`
opens a v2 `MapOp` map with a bitwise submask — but over a GENERIC map, not the real `is_attenuation`
`Finset Auth` lattice, and with NO production-authority leg. The proven OPENABLE sorted-Poseidon2 map
already EXISTS: `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap` ("the cap_root machinery generalized to a generic leaf":
`get` = membership opening, `set` = sorted insert-or-update, `root`/`root_injective`/`root_binds_get` =
the openable committed root + its anti-ghost, `ext_get` = canonicity). And the real attenuation lattice
already EXISTS: `Dregg2.Exec.Caps` (`confRights : Cap → ExecAuth = Finset Auth`, `≤` is `⊆`,
`attenuate_confRights_le` = `granted ≤ held`).

This module WELDS those two proven primitives — the openable sorted map + the real lattice — into the
ONE openable `capability_root` model the ARGUS apex needs, AND adds the production-authority leg that
existed NOWHERE: a held-set whose committed root OPENS to the issuer cap a mint requires. The WELD
method: the capability usually already exists, disconnected; welding beats building.

## The two levels (honest, each clean)

  * The COMMITTED level — `HeldEntry` = the leaf CONTENT `(slot, target, rightsMask)` the deployed
    `cap_root.rs` tree holds (a digest, not the executor `Cap` object). The held-set is a sorted-by-slot
    map of entries; `capRoot` is the sponge of the sorted leaf list, EXACTLY `Heap.root`. Equal roots
    BIND the whole held-set (`heldSet_determined`, via `Heap.ext_get` + CR) — the anti-ghost: a forged
    held leaf with inflated rights is excluded. An OPENING (`OpensEntry`) = the root opens at a slot to
    an entry (membership + the recomputed root); the opening is FUNCTIONAL (`opensEntry_functional`).
  * The LATTICE level — the real `is_attenuation` over `Cap`/`ExecAuth = Finset Auth`. `nonAmplifying`
    = `confRights granted ≤ confRights held` (the genuine `⊆`); `grant_attenuated_nonAmplifying` admits
    every honest attenuation; `overGrant_rejected`/`incomparableGrant_rejected` are the two-valued teeth
    (the FULL partial order, not a cardinality scalar).
  * The BRIDGE — `entryEncodes c e`: the committed entry `e`'s `rightsMask` is the submask digest of
    `c`'s conferred rights (`rightsMaskOf c`), and its target is `c`'s. So the in-circuit SUBMASK gate
    `granted.rightsMask ⊑ held.rightsMask` is the committed shadow of the lattice order, the rights
    digest binding both. `submask_of_attenuate` witnesses that an honest attenuation passes BOTH the
    lattice gate and the committed submask gate — the two levels agree on honest grants.

## §3 — PRODUCTION-AUTHORITY (the §3-correct leg, NEW)

`ProductionAuthorized` = the producer's held-set root OPENS, at a slot, to the ISSUER entry for asset
`A` (`IssuerEntry`: targets `A`, carries the `control`/mint bit). `production_of_held_issuer` is the
constructive witness (EXHIBIT the held issuer entry ⟹ authority); `unauthorizedMint_rejected` is the
anti-unauthorized-mint tooth (no opening ⟹ rejected); `wrongAssetMint_rejected` binds the asset.

## §4 — the CIRCUIT DESCRIPTOR (the LAW#1 emit)

`capReshapeVmDescriptor : EffectVmDescriptor` — in-row sites RECOMPUTE the held-entry leaf + the
granted-entry leaf + bind them into `cap_root`, plus the submask non-amp gate (`granted & held =
granted`) and the production-authority issuer-leaf site, with the anti-amplify + anti-unauthorized-mint
teeth proven at `satisfiedVm`. Byte-pinned via `emitVmJson` (→ `circuit/descriptors/*.json`).

## The honest seam (the carried hypothesis for the full ARGUS apex)

The committed-level anti-ghost + the lattice-level non-amp are both axiom-clean against the abstract CR
sponge (`Poseidon2SpongeCR`). The descriptor's in-circuit non-amp checks the SUBMASK shadow and binds
the rights digest; the bridge to the genuine `Finset Auth` order is `entryEncodes` (the rights-encoding
faithfulness, a per-cell-bound named correspondence — the boundary `EffectVmEmitV2` carries). The
TURN-level binding of the opened `cap_root` to the producer's authenticated cell-root is the sdk
authority-binding (`full_turn_proof.rs`, the Phase-D payoff), cited not claimed here.

A cell's HELD capabilities commit, in the deployed `cap_root.rs` tree, as a sorted-by-slot map whose
leaves bind the CONTENT `(slot, target, rightsMask)` (slot unique per the c-list,
`validate_capability_uniqueness` → injective key → one leaf per slot). The committed `capRoot` is the
sponge of the sorted cap-leaf list — EXACTLY the openable `Heap.root` shape with the cap leaf
`capLeaf = hash[slot, target, rightsMask]`. So every `Heap` opening theorem (`get`/`set`/`root_injective`/
`ext_get`) applies to the held-set VERBATIM. -/

capRoot of a SORTED held-set in which `slot` opens to entry `e`. The witness the circuit gates consume:

Equal capRoots ⇒ (outer CR) equal leaf lists ⇒ (per-leaf CR) equal `(slot, entry)` pairs ⇒ equal

/-! ## §2 — NON-AMPLIFICATION: a granted cap cannot exceed the opened held cap.

The crown property, at the genuine `is_attenuation` lattice (`Cap`/`ExecAuth = Finset Auth`), NOT the
cardinality shadow nor a `()≤()` collapse. Because a genuine `attenuate` structurally narrows, the gate
ADMITS every honest attenuation (`grant_attenuated_nonAmplifying`) and REJECTS a rights-superset or
incomparable pair (`overGrant_rejected`/`incomparableGrant_rejected`) — two-valued, the FULL partial
order. The COMMITTED-level submask shadow (`submask`) is what the circuit checks; `submask_of_attenuate`
shows an honest attenuation also passes the submask gate (so the two levels agree on honest grants). -/

/-- **`nonAmplifying held granted`** — the NON-AMPLIFICATION predicate: the granted cap confers `≤`
the held cap, over the genuine `ExecAuth = Finset Auth` `⊆` order (the real `is_attenuation`). The
grant gate admits IFF this holds; a grant that amplifies (rights ⊄ held) is rejected. -/
def nonAmplifying (held granted : Cap) : Prop := confRights granted ≤ confRights held

/-- `nonAmplifying` is DECIDABLE (the `Finset Auth` order is decidable), so the gate is computable. -/
instance (held granted : Cap) : Decidable (nonAmplifying held granted) := by
  unfold nonAmplifying; infer_instance

/-- **`grant_attenuated_nonAmplifying` — the gate ADMITS every honest attenuation.** A cap granted by
ATTENUATING the held cap (`attenuate keep held` — the only way to derive a child cap) is
non-amplifying: directly the executor's structural narrowing `attenuate_confRights_le`. So an honest
grant always passes the gate (fail-closed, never fail-stuck). -/
theorem grant_attenuated_nonAmplifying (held : Cap) (keep : List Auth) :
    nonAmplifying held (attenuate keep held) :=
  attenuate_confRights_le keep held

/-- **`nonAmplifying_admits_iff` — the gate is exactly the FULL subset check.** The non-amplification
predicate holds IFF `granted`'s conferred rights are `⊆` `held`'s, over the genuine `Finset Auth`
order — so the gate is two-valued (admits a subset, rejects a non-subset). -/
theorem nonAmplifying_admits_iff (held granted : Cap) :
    nonAmplifying held granted ↔ confRights granted ≤ confRights held := Iff.rfl

/-- **`overGrant_rejected` — THE ANTI-AMPLIFY TOOTH (witness FALSE).** A grant whose rights are a
strict SUPERSET of the held cap is REJECTED: a parent holding only `{read}` cannot grant `{read, write}`
— `¬ nonAmplifying`. The gate fails closed on amplification. -/

/-- **`incomparableGrant_rejected` — the FULL partial-order tooth (witness FALSE).** The thing a
cardinality gate could NEVER do: a parent holding only `{read}` cannot grant `{write}` (EQUAL
cardinality, but neither ⊆ the other) — `¬ nonAmplifying`. The gate decides the genuine `Finset Auth`
partial order, not a scalar. -/

/-! ### §2′ — the BRIDGE: the committed submask shadow of the lattice order.

The deployed cap-tree leaf holds a rights MASK (a felt), not the `Finset Auth`; the in-circuit non-amp
gate compares two masks bitwise (`granted ⊑ held` ⟺ `granted &&& held = granted`). `rightsMaskOf c` is
the canonical mask of a cap's conferred rights; an opening at the committed level exposes
`held.rightsMask`, and the gate checks `granted.rightsMask ⊑ held.rightsMask`. This is the shadow the
circuit can enforce per-row; the genuine lattice non-amp (§2) is the model property the encoding
faithfulness (`entryEncodes`) lifts to. -/

/-- The per-`Auth` bit weight as a NAT (for the bitwise OR fold; the canonical positional mask matching
`cap_root.rs`'s mask split). -/

def authBit (a : Auth) : ℤ := (authBitN a : ℤ)

/-- **`rightsMaskOf c`** — the conferred-rights MASK of a cap (the bitwise OR of its conferred `Auth`
bits, as a felt). The committed value the cap leaf binds (`entryEncodes`); the mask the submask gate
reads. -/
def rightsMaskOf (c : Cap) : ℤ :=
  (((capAuthConferred c).foldr (fun a m => m ||| authBitN a) 0 : Nat) : ℤ)

  | .node t       => (t : ℤ)
  | .null         => -1

/-- **`entryEncodes c e`** — the BRIDGE: the committed entry `e` is the digest of cap `c` (same target,
same conferred-rights mask). The per-cell-bound correspondence the descriptor's submask gate rides on:
on a row where the opened held entry encodes the parent cap and the granted entry encodes the child,
the submask gate `granted.rightsMask ⊑ held.rightsMask` is the committed shadow of `nonAmplifying`. -/
def entryEncodes (c : Cap) (e : HeldEntry) : Prop :=
  e.target = capTargetOf c ∧ e.rightsMask = rightsMaskOf c

/-- **`submask a b`** — the committed-level non-amp check: `a ⊑ b` bitwise (`a &&& b = a`). The exact
relation the in-circuit submask gate / `EffectVmEmitV2.subsetTable` enforces over the felt masks. -/

concrete honest attenuation — narrowing `endpoint`-rights `[read, write]` (mask `3`) to `[read]` (mask
`1`) — the GRANTED mask IS a submask of the HELD mask (`1 ⊑ 3`, `1 &&& 3 = 1`). So a grant that the
lattice gate `nonAmplifying` admits ALSO passes the in-circuit committed SUBMASK gate: the committed
shadow agrees with the genuine `Finset Auth` order on honest grants (the `entryEncodes` correspondence,
witnessed). Non-vacuous in BOTH directions: the genuine attenuation `confRights {read} ≤ {read,write}`
holds (`grant_attenuated_nonAmplifying`-shape) AND its mask shadow `1 ⊑ 3` holds. -/

/-! ## §3 — PRODUCTION-AUTHORITY: a mint is gated on OPENING the issuer's capability.

Authority is PRODUCTION under non-forgeability, NOT affine descent (the §3 correction). A mint/
production of asset `A` is authorized IFF the producer HOLDS the issuer capability for `A` — and the
circuit witnesses that by OPENING the issuer entry from the producer's held-set root. The producer
cannot conjure authority it does not hold; it can only EXHIBIT (open) a held issuer cap. The mint right

cap-reshape row:

  * the HELD-LEAF recompute (`siteHeldLeaf`): `held_leaf = hash[slot, target, held_mask]` — binds the
    opened held entry's content (its bits are the in-circuit `held_mask`);
  * an 8-bit DECOMPOSITION of the held mask + the granted mask (the `Auth` mask is 8 bits), each bit
    booleaned (`b·(b−1)=0`) and the mask RECONSTRUCTED from its bits (`mask = Σ bᵢ·2ⁱ`);
  * the NON-AMP submask gate, per-bit: `gᵢ·(1−hᵢ)=0` — a granted bit may be set ONLY where the held bit
    is (`granted ⊑ held` bitwise), the in-row anti-amplify tooth;
  * the PRODUCTION-AUTHORITY gate: `held_target = asset` (PI) AND the control bit `h₆ = 1` — the opened
    held leaf IS the issuer leaf for the minted asset, the in-row anti-unauthorized-mint tooth.

exactly these from a satisfying witness; the rejections (`capReshape_rejects_amplify`,

/-! ### §4.2 — `satisfiedVm` consequences: the descriptor ENFORCES the two openings in-row.

We extract the per-bit submask (non-amp) and the issuer binding (production) from a satisfying witness.
The boundary flags: the production `piBinding .first` fires on the (single active) first row, so we take
`isFirst = true`. The per-bit gates are `.gate` bodies — under the deployed `when_transition()` they bind
on EVERY row but the last, so the in-circuit teeth are extracted at `isLast = false` (the active
transition row, which any real ≥2-row trace carries; the final row is the wrap/pad row). -/

/-- **`capReshape_nonAmp_in_circuit` — THE IN-CIRCUIT NON-AMP TOOTH.** A satisfying witness FORCES, on a
transition row (`isLast = false`), for every bit `i < MASK_BITS`, the granted bit ≤ the held bit
(`gᵢ = 0 ∨ hᵢ = 1`) — i.e. `granted ⊑ held` bitwise, per bit. The gate body vanishes mod the BabyBear
prime `p`, so the exact-`ℤ` conclusion needs CANONICALITY of the two bit cells (`0 ≤ cell < p` — what
the deployed range check supplies), then primality of `p` splits the product residual. The light client
reads ONLY the proof; this is the in-circuit non-amplification it now sees, not an executor-trusted
side-check. -/

/-! ## §4D — THE DELEGATION-FAMILY NON-AMP GATES (the cap-root recompute's `granted ⊑ held` leg).

`§4` above is the MINT/production flavour: the held mask is the OPENED issuer leaf and the production
gate binds `held_target = asset` + the control bit. The cap-GRAPH family (`delegate`, `delegateAtten`,
`attenuate`, `introduce`, `revoke`, `refresh`) needs the OTHER leg of the SAME non-amp shadow: every
cap-graph row RECOMPUTES `cap_root` by hashing a `(holder, target, rights, op)` edge leaf
(`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.siteCapEdgeLeaf`), where `rights` (`cp.RIGHTS`, param 4) is the GRANTED edge's
conferred-rights mask — the value COMMITTED into the recomputed root. The delegation non-amp leg gates,
IN-CIRCUIT, that this granted mask is a SUBMASK of the delegator's HELD mask (`granted ⊑ held`), so a
grant cannot confer rights the delegator does not hold — and the very rights it binds into `cap_root`.

The wiring that makes this LOAD-BEARING (not a free side-check): the GRANTED bit decomposition
reconstructs `cp.RIGHTS` — the SAME param column `siteCapEdgeLeaf` hashes into the cap-edge leaf. So
the in-circuit submask gate and the cap-root recompute read the SAME `rights` felt: an amplifying grant
either FAILS the submask gate (caught here) or, if it tampers `rights` to dodge the gate, MOVES the
recomputed `cap_root` ⇒ moves `state_commit` ⇒ UNSAT (`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.capRoot_binds_edge`). The
held mask rides a free param (param 7); the held bits decode it; the per-bit gate `gᵢ·(1−hᵢ)=0` is the
anti-amplify tooth. NO production gate (a delegate is not a mint), NO new width (aux columns < 186). -/

The model is computable: a concrete held-set opens, a concrete production authorizes, on the same

soundness theorems above use the abstract CR sponge; these guards exhibit realizable witnesses.) -/

/-! ### §5D — the DELEGATION non-amp gates fire BOTH polarities (a concrete cap-graph row).

A concrete delegation row: the delegator HOLDS `{read, write}` (mask 3, bits `h₀=h₁=1`, rest 0) and
GRANTS `{read}` (mask 1, bit `g₀=1`, rest 0) — an HONEST attenuation. The held/granted bit columns
carry the genuine 8-bit decompositions; the granted recon ties to `cp.RIGHTS = 1`, the held recon to
param 7 = 3. The submask gates all pass (`g₀=1 ≤ h₀=1`, every other `gᵢ=0`). The dual witness: an
OVER-GRANT row (`g₁=1` but `h₁=0`, conferring `write` the delegator lacks) is REJECTED. -/

/-- A concrete HONEST delegation row: held mask 3 (`{read,write}`, param 7 col 75; held bits col 120 = h₀=1,
col 121 = h₁=1, cols 122..127 = 0), granted mask 1 (`{read}`, `cp.RIGHTS` param 4 col 72; granted bits
col 128 = g₀=1, cols 129..135 = 0). The literal columns ARE what `dcol`/`prmCol` reduce to (anti-drift,

/-- **NON-VACUITY (witness TRUE — an HONEST delegation ADMITS).** The honest attenuation row (grant
`{read}` from held `{read,write}`) satisfies EVERY delegation submask gate: each granted bit is `≤` its
held bit (`g₀=1 ≤ h₀=1`; every other `gᵢ=0`). So the in-circuit non-amp predicate is INHABITED — an
honest delegation binds its cap-root AND passes non-amp, not vacuously false. -/
