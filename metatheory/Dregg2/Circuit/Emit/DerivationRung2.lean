# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.DerivationRung2 — the Rung-2 no-forgery layer for the Datalog DERIVATION AIR.

## What this file IS (and how the fix closes the body↔membership-leaf gap)

`DerivationRefine.lean` (Rung-1) proves the SAT_IMPLIES_SEM direction against the *head* chain:
a `Satisfied2` derivation trace publishes a conclusion that IS the genuine `hash_fact` of the head
(the C4 chip ∘ C6 pin crown), under the named `ChipTableSound` carrier. That leg is genuinely
enforced in-circuit.

The *body* chain is not authenticated by an in-circuit Merkle lookup. No constraint proves
`bodyHash i` (cols 1..8) IS a member of the committed root `pi[0]`:

* C2 (`DerivationEmit.lean:214`) forces only `flag_i · (hash_i · inv_i − 1) = 0` — nonzero-when-used.
  Over the ℤ field model this makes `bodyHash i` any UNIT (`±1`), authenticating nothing.
* C5 (`:226`) pins the SEPARATE decorative `bodyRoot i` column (cols 31..38) to `pi[0]` — but that
  column is never linked to `bodyHash i`. It authenticates the root against itself, not the fact.

So the descriptor ALONE still accepts a fabricated body fact — this file keeps the concrete
accepted-but-non-genuine witness (`der_accepts_fabricated_body_fact`) and PROVES it `Satisfied2`.

**The fix (held forgery #3).** Rather than add an in-circuit Merkle tooth (a shared-file layout
change), the deployed descriptor now EXPORTS body atom 0's fact hash as the public input `pi[5]`
(the new C6b pin + boundary, `DerivationEmit.lean:c6b`). `der_body_fact_exported` proves the binding:
every `Satisfied2` trace has `bodyHash 0 = pi[5]` on row 0. The fabricated hash the descriptor
accepts is therefore FORCED into a bound public handle. The full-turn verifier binds that handle to
the c-list membership leg's authenticated leaf (`membership.leaf_hash == derivation.pi[5]`), so a
forger who publishes `pi[5] = -1` must ALSO exhibit a membership proof for `-1` — which they do not
hold. `der_accepts_fabricated_body_fact` now publishes `pi[5] = -1` to stay accepted, exactly
witnessing that the residual (the missing in-circuit Merkle tooth) is closed at the COMPOSITION.

## The honest closure (a NAMED carrier, now DISCHARGEABLE via the export)

The genuine body-fact membership relation still enters as the NAMED carrier `BodyMembershipSound`,
the body-fact analog of `ChipTableSound`. The fix's payoff is `der_carrier_slot0_discharged_by_pi`:
the slot-0 conjunct of the carrier — undischarged by any in-circuit lookup — now FOLLOWS from a single
external fact about the exported PI (`DbMember pi[0] pi[5]`, what the membership leg proves), because
C6b binds `bodyHash 0 = pi[5]`. The AUDIT FIX (§5, `DerivationEmit.lean:c6c`) extends this to the
FURTHER body atoms: `bodyHash i = pi[5 + i]` for all eight slots, so `der_carrier_further_discharged`
composition-discharges slots 1..7 exactly as slot 0. A fully in-circuit Merkle tooth over the body
slots remains a layout change for a later rung, but every body-fact hash is now a BOUND public handle
(no longer a free witness), which is what the composition needs.

The carrier is proven LOAD-BEARING, not vacuous: it ACCEPTS the honest witness
(`honest_satisfies_membership`) and REJECTS the fabricated one (`forge_violates_membership`) — so it
is exactly the missing authentication, and the `bodyFactsMembers` conjunct of the full relation comes
WHOLLY from the carrier (the descriptor contributes zero to it — `der_authentic_needs_carrier`).

/-! ## §1 — The accepted-cheat-witness: a FABRICATED body fact the descriptor accepts.

`waForge` is the honest witness `wa` (`DerivationRefine.lean:381`) with ONE change: the active
body-fact hash `bodyHash 0` is flipped from the honest `1` to the fabricated unit `-1`, with its C2
inverse `bodyInv 0 = -1` (so `(-1)·(-1) = 1` keeps C2 nonzero-when-used satisfied). Every other
column — the head, the derived hash, the comparators, the substitution selectors — is byte-identical
to `wa`, so the C4 chip and C6/boundary pins fire identically. -/

/-- The forged row: `wa` with `bodyHash 0 = -1` (a fabricated non-member) and its matching inverse. -/
def waForge : Assignment := fun v =>
  if v = bodyFlag 0 then 1
  else if v = bodyHash 0 then (-1)
  else if v = bodyInv 0 then (-1)
  else 0

/-- The forged trace: two rows of `waForge`. Its chip table is REUSED from the honest witness
(`witTf`) — legitimate because the C4 fact-site tuple reads only head/derived/lane columns, all of
which are `0` in BOTH `wa` and `waForge`, so the evaluated tuples coincide.

`pub 5 = -1` publishes the FABRICATED body-fact hash at the C6b export slot (so the forge is still
`Satisfied2` — see below). This is the crux of the fix: the fabricated hash the descriptor accepts is
now FORCED into a BOUND public input `pi[5]`, which the full-turn verifier cross-checks against the
membership leg's authenticated leaf. A forger cannot both publish `pi[5] = -1` AND exhibit a c-list
membership proof for `-1` (they do not hold it) — so the composition rejects, even though the
derivation descriptor alone (lacking an in-circuit Merkle tooth) still accepts. -/

393 gate/pin constraints holds on both rows (decided — C2 rides the fabricated `(-1)·(-1) = 1`
inverse; the NEW C6b pin `bodyHash 0 = pi[5]` holds because the forge publishes `pi[5] = -1`), the
lone C4 lookup finds its genuine chip row (head unchanged), and the (empty) memory legs balance. The
descriptor CANNOT tell the fabricated body fact from the honest one — BUT the fabricated hash is now
forced into the bound public input `pi[5]` (C6b), where the full-turn verifier binds it to the
membership leg's authenticated leaf. The in-circuit Merkle tooth is still absent; the closure is at
the composition, via the export this fix adds. -/

binds the two equal. For the deployed authorization rule `Allow(?0) :- capability(?0)` (a SINGLE body
atom, slot 0), this is the WHOLE carrier — the gap is closed at the composition by the PI export plus
the membership leg. (Multi-atom rules: the further atoms are now exported too by C6c —

/-- **`honest_satisfies_membership`** — the carrier ACCEPTS the honest witness: `wa`'s active body

/-- **`forge_violates_membership` — THE regression pole: the forge is REJECTED by the carrier.** The

a member. So the carrier is EXACTLY the tooth that separates the honest witness (accepted) from the
forge (rejected) — a non-vacuous, load-bearing hypothesis, not a laundered tautology. Since the
descriptor accepts the forge anyway (`der_accepts_fabricated_body_fact`), the descriptor ALONE cannot

/-! ## §5 — THE AUDIT REGRESSION: the C6c export closes the MULTI-ATOM body-fact forgery.

The audit confirmed that `bodyHash 1..7` (cols 2..8) — the FURTHER body atoms of a multi-atom rule —
were bound ONLY by C2 (nonzero-when-used), never to a committed member: C6b exported only slot 0. A
forger could therefore activate a further body slot with an arbitrary fabricated fact hash and have
the descriptor ACCEPT it. The C6c fix (`DerivationEmit.lean:c6c`) exports every further body-fact hash
as its own public input (`bodyHash i == pi[5 + i]`), so the fabricated hash is forced into a bound
handle the full-turn verifier binds to that atom's membership leaf. This section:

* proves the NEW in-circuit tooth (`der_body_facts_further_exported`): each further body hash is now
  pinned to its export;
* exhibits the REGRESSION (`der_rejects_unexported_body_fact`): a forge that activates slot 1 with a
  fabricated `bodyHash 1 = -1` but publishes a genuine member `pi[6] = 0` is now `¬ Satisfied2` — the
  slot-1 export pin bites (before the fix this exact trace was accepted);
* shows the forge is otherwise-valid (`forge_slot1_exported_satisfies`): the SAME fabricated hash stays
  accepted ONLY when the prover also publishes it at `pi[6] = -1`, exactly the C6b residual now
  extended to the further atoms (accepted-but-disclosed, so the membership leg rejects at composition);
* shows an HONEST multi-atom derivation (slots 0 AND 1 active, both facts genuine members published at
  their exports) still `Satisfied2`s (`honestBody2_satisfies`) — the pins are non-vacuous, accepting
  honest derivations while rejecting the forge. -/

/-- **`honestBody2_satisfies` — an honest TWO-ATOM derivation still `Satisfied2`s (non-vacuity of the
C6c pins).** With both body slots active and each fact hash equal to its published export
(`bodyHash i = pi[5 + i] = 1`), every constraint — including the eight body-fact export pins — holds
on both rows, and the C4 lookup finds its chip row. So the C6c fix does not reject honest derivations;
the export pins accept the honest witness exactly as they reject the forge. -/
