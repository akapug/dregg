# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitCapRoot — the GENUINE in-row `cap_root` recompute
(the shared class-A side-table primitive for the WHOLE cap-graph family: attenuate, delegate,
delegateAtten, revoke, introduce, refreshDelegation, dropRef).

## Why this module exists (the class-A deepening)

The earlier cap-graph descriptors (`EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.gCapMove`) bound the `cap_root` column move by
an OPAQUE DIGEST PARAMETER: `new_cap_root = param.CAP_DIGEST_NEW`, where `param.CAP_DIGEST_NEW` is a FREE
param column the prover supplies with `D (post.caps)`. The cap-table membership is NEVER recomputed
in-row; `D` enters only as `Function.Injective D`. That is NOT class A — a hostile prover can pick ANY
post-`cap_root`, so the attenuated/derived cap-table is *asserted*, not *recomputed*. The coverage ledger
flags this exactly:

  > "the `cap_root` *column* is moved + anti-ghosted + unified to `AttenuateSpec`. **The gap:**
  >  `cap_digest_new` is the opaque digest `D k.caps` — the descriptor does NOT recompute the attenuated
  >  cap-table membership in-row (`D` enters only as `Function.Injective D`)."
  >  (`_CIRCUIT-ASSURANCE-PER-EFFECT.md:101`, Tier 1 item 4)

The class-A bar (ember's directive, the escrow template `EffectVmEmitEscrowRoot`) is:

  > "the side-table root must be GENUINELY recomputed in-row (`new_root = update(old_root, element)`),
  >  not a witnessed parameter."

This module supplies that recompute as a SHARED primitive, so attenuate / delegate / delegateAtten /
revoke / introduce / refreshDelegation / dropRef all inherit ONE genuine cap-root recompute.

## What `cap_root` IS, and why a single shared advance gate suffices

The `caps` side-table is a function `Caps = Label → List Cap`; its committed digest is the `cap_root`
column (state offset `state.CAP_ROOT = 11`). Every cap-graph effect mutates `caps` by editing ONE holder
slot (`grant` / `attenuate` / `filter`), i.e. it installs ONE cap-graph EDGE-MUTATION
`(holder, target, rights, op)` — a Granovetter delegate edge, an attenuation, or an edge removal. The
runtime's cap-table digest is an APPEND/PREPEND accumulator over edge-mutations: the new root is
`hash_2_to_1(edge_leaf, old_root)` — the canonical prepend-accumulator advance (the SAME shape escrow uses
for the parked record, `EffectVmEmitEscrowRoot:35`, but here the leaf is the cap-edge mutation). The `op`
tag distinguishes attenuate (0) / delegate (1) / delegateAtten (2) / revoke (3) / introduce (4) / dropRef
(5) / refresh (6), so the SAME advance gate serves every cap effect (the single shared IR gate-kind ember
asked for) while binding which mutation occurred.

## What this module BINDS (genuinely, in-row)

  1. **`siteCapEdgeLeaf`** — a hash-site that RECOMPUTES the mutated cap-edge's leaf in-row:
     `edge_leaf = hash[ holder, target, rights, op ]`, where each input reads a dedicated param column.
     The prover cannot choose the leaf freely; it is `hash` of the bound edge-mutation content.
  2. **`siteCapRootAdvance`** — a hash-site that RECOMPUTES the new `cap_root` in-row:
     `new_cap_root = hash[ edge_leaf, old_cap_root ]` — the genuine prepend-accumulator advance, reading
     the recomputed leaf (site above) and the OLD `cap_root` column (`sbCol state.CAP_ROOT`). The new root
     is FORCED by `(edge_leaf, old_root)`, not asserted.
  3. The new-root carrier IS `saCol state.CAP_ROOT` — **already an absorbed `state_commit` column** (it is
     the 12th element of the transfer keystone's `absorbedCols`, bound by GROUP-4 `site2`). So UNLIKE the
     escrow root (which rides aux 96, off the deployed row, task #91), the recomputed `cap_root` lands
     directly in a column the deployed commitment already absorbs — the cap family reaches FULL class A
     with NO deployment widening. Tampering any edge field / old root / new root provably MOVES
     `cap_root` ⇒ moves `state_commit` ⇒ UNSAT (`capRoot_binds_edge`).

## The genuine-recompute soundness (`capRootAdvance_forced`)

Under the two hash-sites, the new `cap_root` is UNIQUELY `hash[ hash[holder,target,rights,op], old_root ]`
— a DETERMINISTIC FUNCTION of (the bound edge fields, the old root). No free digest parameter survives:

  * **forced**: two rows with the SAME edge fields AND the same old root have the SAME new root
    (`capRootAdvance_forced`) — the recompute is a function, not a choice;
  * **anti-ghost on the edge**: under CR, two rows publishing the same new root that recompute it
    have the SAME edge-leaf-tuple AND the same old root (`capRoot_binds_edge`) — so tampering ANY edge
    field (holder/target/rights/op) or the old root changes the new root.

This is what the opaque digest could never give: the root is now a genuine recomputation of the cap-table
digest advance, FORCED by the bound edge-mutation content.

## The cap Phase A VALUE model (what `cap_root` IS now)

cap Phase A made the `cap_root` VALUE an OPENABLE sorted-Poseidon2 binary Merkle root over the
c-list (`circuit/src/cap_root.rs`'s `CanonicalCapTree`, mirroring the proven `DslRevocationTree`:
sorted, sentinel-bracketed, `hash_fact` nodes, depth 16; leaf = `Poseidon2(slot_hash, target,
auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi, expiry, breadstuff)`), computed BYTE-IDENTICALLY in the cell
(`dregg_cell::compute_canonical_capability_root_felt`) and the circuit (the EffectVM `cap_root`
column is SEEDED from that same value, not from `BabyBear::ZERO`). The cell≡circuit
differential `circuit/tests/cap_root_cell_circuit_differential.rs` is the gate.

This module is UNAFFECTED by that value change, and that is exactly the point of the Phase-A
staging boundary:

  * **Frozen-carry effects** (the cutover's AGREE set) pin `cap_root_after = cap_root_before` on
    WHATEVER value the column carries — the value is abstract (any `ℤ`), so a non-zero sorted-tree
    root flows through `state_before → state_after → state_commit` transparently. The descriptors
    stay coherent with the new runtime: nothing here assumes `cap_root = 0` (the concrete witness
    `goodCapRow` uses an arbitrary `old_cap_root = 1000`, NOT 0).
  * **⚑ SUPERSEDED — the §2 prepend advance is NOT the deployed cap-root forcing (Phase E is DONE).**
    The `hash[edge_leaf, old_root]` prepend-accumulator advance proven below (`capRootAdvance_forced`)
    is a Phase-A FELT-ACCUMULATOR study: it pins WHICH edge mutated a `cap_root` felt, but does NOT
    force the genuine sorted-tree update of the committed `CanonicalCapTree` (§0). It is EMPHATICALLY
    NOT what the deployed attenuate descriptor advances the root by. The DEPLOYED cap-root forcing is
    the faithful 8-felt sorted-tree write `writesTo8` — a `Satisfied2` of the deployed write descriptor
    (`effCapOpenWriteV3 attenuateV3`, apex `Rfix 12 = attenuateCapOpenEffV3`) TRACE-FORCES the
    membership-open of the addressed OLD leaf against the committed BEFORE cap-root group and the
    genuine narrowed AFTER root over the SHARED path (`CapOpenEmit.effCapOpenWriteV3_forces_write8`,
    forced from `Satisfied2` — "NEVER from `henc`'s `SpineCommits`"), consumed by
    `RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily.attenuate_descriptorRefines_capOpenSat` and wired into the live
    apex (`ClosureFanoutGenuine`, attenuate tag 12). The deployed base
    (`attenuateVmDescriptorGenuineNoRecomputeTick`) carries NEITHER this prepend advance NOR a free
    `CAP_DIGEST_NEW` gate — "the cap-write map-op is what FORCES that root." So this §2 prepend + the
    free-`CAP_DIGEST_NEW` face (`EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.gCapMove`) + the VALUE_PARTIAL study over them
    (`RotatedKernelRefinementAttenuate`, its own header) are SUPERSEDED felt-accumulator DEBT, retained
    only because ~15 cap-family emit / Argus modules still transitively reference `capAdvanceOf` /
    `capRecomputeSites` / `edgeLeafOf`; their deletion is a tracked cross-family cutover, NOT a
    soundness gap. Phase B (the in-circuit sorted open + non-amp leg) adds the authority gates that OPEN
    this root.

This module is therefore ONE layer of a SINGLE cap-root story, not a competing model — read it
alongside its two siblings rather than as a standalone "cap_root = digest" emit:
  * **Phase B (the in-circuit sorted open + non-amp leg)** lives in `EffectVmEmitV2`
    (`attenuateVmDescriptor2`): it EXTENDS the same v1 descriptor with `MapOp.read`/`MapOp.write`
    over the openable sorted-Poseidon2 cap-map plus the bitwise-submask `Lookup`
    (`attenuateV2_non_amp` — held membership authenticated against the before `cap_root`, post
    root the genuine sorted write, `granted ⊑ held`). That is the OPEN of the very root this
    module advances-as-digest; the digest pin here and the sorted open there are different LAYERS
    of one root, not two roots.
  * **The class-A genuine descriptor** that consumes `capRecomputeSites` is
    `EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.attenuateVmDescriptorGenuine` (proven in
    `Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.Attenuate`); the whole cap-graph family
    (delegate / delegateAtten / revokeDelegation / introduce) reuses it. So the prepend-accumulator
    advance below is the SHARED digest spine under all of them, and `EffectVmEmitV2` is the Phase-B
    opening bolted onto the same descriptors.

So every theorem below holds for any `cap_root` value, including the new sorted-Poseidon2 root: the
prepend-accumulator advance + its anti-ghost (`capRoot_binds_edge`) are the Phase-A digest pin; the
openable-tree VALUE the digest carries is the cell≡circuit sorted root.

`CAP_EDGE_LEAF` carries the recomputed edge leaf (an aux column past the state-inter block).

Under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, two rows whose recompute holds and whose NEW `cap_root` carriers are EQUAL
have: (a) the same old root, and (b) the same four bound edge fields. So a prover CANNOT keep the
published new `cap_root` while tampering the mutated holder / target / rights / op / old root. This is the
genuine class-A tooth the opaque digest lacked. -/

ANY of them moves the new root. -/
