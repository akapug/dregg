# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AutomataflResolveRefine — LEG R, the SAT ⇒ SEMANTICS refinement of the
byte-pinned automatafl m=2 move-adjudication descriptor (`automataflResolveDesc`).

## What this file IS

`AutomataflResolveEmit.lean` is Stage 1: the Leg R descriptor STRUCTURE, byte-pinned by an
`emitVmJson2` `#guard` (306 columns, 371 constraints, 32 public inputs). This file is Stage 2: for
each of the descriptor's eight legs, a theorem DERIVING the reference semantics
(`Dregg2.Games.Automatafl`) from the EMITTED constraints on a satisfying, canonical trace. Nothing
is assumed: every fact is extracted from a constraint proved to be a MEMBER of the byte-pinned
`automataflResolveDesc.constraints` (`by decide` over the fold-generated list), exactly as
`AutomataflStepRefine.lean` closed Leg A.

The field glue (`Canon`, `bin_of_gate`, `eq_of_modEq_canon`, `forcedGe0_core`, `StepCanon`,
`codeToParticle`) is REUSED from `AutomataflStepRefine`; it is descriptor-agnostic.

## DEFECT #4, FOUND HERE AND NOW FIXED AT SOURCE — the board cells were NOT range-checked

`automataflStepDesc` carries `boardRangeConstraints` — `assert_member(cell, {0,1,2,3})` on every
OLD and NEW board column. That family is what let Leg A's capstone be UNCONDITIONAL.

`automataflResolveDesc` HAD NO SUCH FAMILY, and that was LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. The
source-non-vacuum bit is `anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, SMALL_RBITS=5)`, so a witnessed source particle
`fp = 4` satisfies `anz = 1` (the circuit treats the cell as CARRYING A PIECE) while
`codeToParticle 4 = .vacuum` (the reference treats it as EMPTY) — and the 5-bit comparison supplies
no a-priori window that would exclude it. A satisfying witness with an out-of-alphabet cell
therefore made the capstone FALSE.

FIXED: `AutomataflResolveEmit.boardRangeConstraints` now emits `assert_member(cell, {0,1,2,3})` on
every OLD and MID board column (constraints 371 → 379, wire golden re-pinned, descriptor
regenerated). The `BoardAlphabet` envelope is consequently a THEOREM here — `boardvalid_of_sat` —
extracted from the byte-pinned constraint list, and `srcNonVac_of_sat` no longer takes it as a
hypothesis. Every result in this file is UNCONDITIONAL: there is no assumed envelope left.

## DEFECT #5, FOUND HERE AND NOW FIXED AT SOURCE — the identical-move turn was UNSATISFIABLE

`write_mid_witnessed`'s cell polynomial subtracted `carry_i·src_i[c]·old[c]` once PER PIECE. When
both moves cleared the SAME square (`frm_a = frm_b` with both sources carrying — two players
proposing the identical move, which the reference explicitly does NOT treat as a conflict, see
`Automatafl.conflictResolve`) the old particle was subtracted TWICE, forcing `mid[frm] ≡ −old[frm]`.
Since DEFECT #4's alphabet gates pin both cells into `{0,1,2,3}`, that forced `old[frm] = 0` —
contradicting the carry. The leaf was UNSATISFIABLE on that legal turn: a COMPLETENESS defect
(soundness was never at risk — a legal turn was refused, no forged board admitted).

FIXED: `AutomataflResolveEmit.writeCellHead` now carries the SHARED-ENDPOINT inclusion–exclusion —
`+ A·C·old` (a shared source is vacated exactly once) and `+ B·D·old − B·D·particle_b` (a shared
landing deposits exactly one particle). Constraint COUNT is unchanged (379); the wire golden was
re-pinned and `circuit/descriptors/by-name/automatafl-resolve.json` regenerated (drift gate PASS).
The canary polarity is FLIPPED: `canonDoubleGood` now SATISFIES both the cell gate and the alphabet
gate at `mid = 0`, and the two forges (`mid = −1`, the OLD forced value; `mid = 1`, source not
vacated) are REJECTED — so the fix MOVED the pinned value rather than widening the gate.
`noSharedSource` is replaced by `sharedSourceVacatesOnce`, and `cellAlgebra` no longer takes
`A·C = 0` / `B·D = 0` as hypotheses: those two configurations are now LIVE, satisfiable cases.

## What is CLOSED here, and what is NOT (the honest residual)

CLOSED: R1 (auto pin) · R2 (`validate_move` ⇒ `MoveValid`, witnessed source read) · R3 (witnessed
`is_vertical`, occlusion) · the R4 pattern bits, selection truth table and `srcNonVac`
(unconditional) · (a) `boardvalid_of_sat` · (b) `conflictResolve_pair` · (c) THE `m = 2`
CATERPILLAR, BOTH SIDES (`chainDest_a`/`chainDest_b`; `carry_of_sat`/`ft_of_sat` and their four
instances) · (d) R6's EXTRACTORS AND ALGEBRA (§5.8): `dstOneHot_of_sat`, `writeCell_of_sat`,
`cellAlgebra` (eleven live cases of sixteen, the five excluded ones being ONLY the same-piece
`A·B = C·D = 0`) · (e) NEW, §5.8.2 — THE INDICATOR GLUE, residual (i), CLOSED:
`oneHotPair_indicator`, `srcIndicator_of_sat` and `dstIndicator_of_sat` identify the emitted
products `carry·srcRow·srcCol` / `carry·dstRow·dstCol` with the decidable `Coord` predicates
`⟨x,y⟩ = frm_k` / `⟨x,y⟩ = dest_k` (the interpolated `to_own + ft·(to_other − to_own)`), per cell,
via the `Int.toNat` bridge — memberships `decide`d against the byte-pinned constraint list.

Also CLOSED, in `Dregg2.Games.Automatafl` (reference side, no circuit content):

  * §8b THE SEAM LEMMA — `automatonStep_congr`: two boards agreeing on `size`, `automaton`,
    `useColumnRule` and every IN-BOUNDS cell step to boards agreeing on every in-bounds cell.
    This is what the whole-turn composition needs, because the Leg R → Leg A seam is a CELL-WISE
    agreement (what a `mid_root` PI equality gives) and NOT a `Board` equality. Built on
    `raycastFuel_congr` / `raycast_congr` / `automatonOffset_congr`.
  * §8c THE REFERENCE UNFOLDING, residual (ii), CLOSED — `applyMoves_cell_TT/TF/FT/FF`: the
    `filter`/`map`/`find?` pipeline of `applyMoves bd [ma, mb]` evaluated per cell in all FOUR
    `(anz, bnz)` shapes of `pieceSrcs`, into the same per-cell if-chain the gate computes
    (landing-A first, then landing-B, then vacuum on a cleared source, else the old cell — the
    reference's `find?` list order IS the gate's `B`-before-`D` priority).

Also CLOSED — residual (iii), THE ASSEMBLY (§6.5):

  * `resolve_sat_imp_resolveMid` — **LEG R'S CAPSTONE, UNCONDITIONAL.** On any satisfying,
    canonical trace the decoded MID board IS `Automatafl.resolveMid` of the decoded OLD board and
    the two decoded moves, cell-wise over every in-bounds cell. `resolveFacts_of_sat` derives the
    per-row semantics ONCE (validity, alphabet, the four pattern bits read as `Coord` equalities,
    the survive verdict as the reference's fork/collide disjunction, the carries, the flow-through
    bits, and the four one-hot indicators as `Coord` predicates); `midCell_of_facts` then cases on
    the survive verdict and on which sources carry, matches each shape to the corresponding
    `applyMoves_cell_*` lemma, resolves the landing through `chainDest_a`/`chainDest_b`, and pins
    the cell with `cellAlgebra` through the indicator glue. `forkCollide_bool_of_sat` supplies the
    fork/collide range `selection_of_sat` did not, which is what makes the NON-surviving direction
    (`surv = 0 ⇒ the reference really does drop both moves`) provable rather than one-sided.
  * `resolve_step_sat_imp_applyTurn` — **THE WHOLE TURN.** Leg R sat + Leg A sat + a NAMED seam
    hypothesis (Leg A's decoded OLD board agrees cell-wise, and on the automaton coordinate, with
    Leg R's decoded MID board — what the fold-level `mid_root` PI equality enforces, both legs
    binding a `board_root8` of those very columns) ⇒ the decoded NEW board IS
    `Automatafl.applyTurn` of the decoded OLD board with the two decoded moves, cell-wise. Glued by
    `Automatafl.applyTurn_factors` and the cell-wise congruence `Automatafl.automatonStep_congr`,
    over `AutomataflStepRefine.astep_sat_imp_automatonStep`. The seam is a HYPOTHESIS and is
    labelled as one: nothing here derives that the two traces speak about the same board.

There is no `sorry`, no assumed arithmetization hypothesis, no assumed mid-board link beyond that
named seam, and no weakened or vacuous capstone standing in for either.

## Axiom hygiene

`#print axioms` on every exported theorem; the subset is `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.
No `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no assumed arithmetization hypothesis.

/-! ## §3 — The `forced_ge0` extractor.

EVERY threshold bit in the descriptor (`iv`, `eqx`, `eqy`, `occ`, `anz`, `bnz`, the four
`eq_coords` bits) is `forced_ge0` over the SAME head shape `(Head.lin 1 val).addConst (-1)`, i.e.
`ib == [val − 1 ≥ 0] == [val ≥ 1]`. One extractor therefore serves the whole descriptor. -/

SMALL `D`, the bit IS the comparison — a forged bit has no satisfying decomposition. -/

/-! ## §5 — R4: the four `eq_coords` pattern bits + the fork/collide/survive selection.

The pattern bits (§5.1) and the selection ALGEBRA (§5.2) are UNCONDITIONAL. Tying the selection to
the reference `conflictResolve` (§5.4) additionally needs the source-non-vacuum bits to mean
"the source cell is non-vacuum", which is where the descriptor's MISSING board-alphabet range check
(§0, the defect) becomes load-bearing: it is carried as the explicit `BoardAlphabet` envelope. -/

/-- **THE PARTICLE-ALPHABET ENVELOPE — now a THEOREM (`boardvalid_of_sat`), not a hypothesis.**

DEFECT #4, as this refinement found it: `automataflResolveDesc` emitted NO
`assert_member(cell,{0,1,2,3})` family (contrast `AutomataflStepEmit.boardRangeConstraints`, which is
exactly what made Leg A's capstone unconditional). Without it a satisfying witness could carry
`old c = 4`, which `codeToParticle` decodes to VACUUM while the circuit's
`anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, 5)` reads as NON-VACUUM — a genuine descriptor/reference DISAGREEMENT over
the whole window `fp ∈ [4, p)`, which made the naive capstone FALSE.

FIXED AT SOURCE: `AutomataflResolveEmit.boardRangeConstraints` now emits the `KK + KK` membership
gates on every OLD and MID board column, the wire golden was re-pinned (371 → 379 constraints), and
this predicate is DERIVED from the descriptor by `boardvalid_of_sat` below. It survives as a named
`Prop` only because it is the convenient shape to thread through the alphabet-sensitive lemmas. -/

/-! ## §5.5 — (b) R4 COROLLARY: the emitted selection IS the reference `conflictResolve`.

The circuit's leg 4 computes three booleans (`fork`, `collide`, `surv`) out of four coordinate-pair
equality bits and two source-non-vacuum bits. The reference computes a LIST: it filters `[ma, mb]`
by "touches no conflicted source and no conflicted destination", where each conflict is an
order-free `hasTwoDistinct` over a sub-list. These are different shapes; this section proves them
the same object at `m = 2`.

The key structural facts, both proved below by exhausting the four decidable equalities: at a
2-element move list `frmConflict` and `toConflict` take the SAME value on `ma` as on `mb` — so the
filter keeps BOTH moves or NEITHER — and those values are literally the circuit's `fork` and
`collide` patterns. -/

/-! ## §5.6 — (c), the REFERENCE HALF of R5: the `m = 2` caterpillar, resolved.

Leg 6 of the descriptor computes two flow-through bits and interpolates each piece's landing square
between its own `to` and the other piece's `to`. The reference computes the same landing by
`followChain` over the move graph `nextOf`. These four lemmas resolve the reference side completely
at `n = 2`: the move graph is a two-entry lookup table (`nextOf_pair` — using `occluded_false_n2`,
so no occlusion survives at this board size), and the chain terminates in exactly the three shapes
the circuit's `ft` bit distinguishes:

  * `followChain_own` — no chain relation (`to_a ≠ frm_b`): the piece lands on its OWN `to`;
  * `followChain_own_landing` — the chain relation holds but the next square is a PIECE source
    (`bnz`, the circuit's `¬ft` conjunct): the caterpillar STOPS there, again the piece's own `to`;
  * `followChain_flowThrough` — the chain relation holds, the next square is VACATING (`¬bnz`) and
    the 2-cycle is broken (`to_b ≠ frm_a`, the circuit's `¬eq_ba` conjunct): the piece flows
    THROUGH to `to_b`. This is exactly `ft_a = 1 ⇒ dest_a = to_b`.

The three cases are jointly exhaustive and pairwise exclusive on the same conditions the emitted
`flowThroughConstraints` branch on, so the reference landing square is a function of precisely the
circuit's `ft` bit. What is NOT yet proven here is the CIRCUIT half of R5 (an `ft_of_sat` extractor
tying the `cFtA`/`cFtB` columns to those conditions) — see the file header for the residual. -/

/-- **THE FOURTH CASE — the 2-CYCLE, which the other three lemmas do NOT cover.** `to_a = frm_b`
(the chain relation), `frm_b` is vacating (`¬bnz`, so the caterpillar does not stop there) and
`to_b = frm_a` — the two moves swap. `followChain` detects the revisit of `frm_a` and returns the

conjunct, so `ft_a = 0` and the interpolated destination is the piece's own `to_a`.

FOUND WHILE CLOSING R5: the three earlier lemmas are NOT jointly exhaustive — `to_a = mb.frm`,
`¬ps.contains mb.frm`, `to_b = frm_a` falls through all of them. This lemma closes that hole. -/

/-! ## §5.8 — (2) R6: the `write_mid_witnessed` endpoints and the per-cell rewrite gate.

Leg 7 is two families: `one_hot_rowcol` on each endpoint of each piece (source pinned to the move's
own `(fx, fy)`, destination pinned to the INTERPOLATED `destHead`), and the `k` per-cell equalities
`mid[c] == keep[c]·old[c] + Σ_i carry_i·dst_i[c]·particle_i` with the swap-restore term. The source
one-hots are ordinary `Builder::one_hot`s (`oneHot_of_sat` applies verbatim — the emitted gate
polynomial is literally the same expression); the destination one-hots need their own extractor
because the index is a HEAD, not a bare column. -/

/-- **The DESTINATION one-hot extractor.** The selector pair is pinned to the interpolated landing
coordinate `own + ft·(other − own)`: on `ft = 0` the piece's own destination, on `ft = 1` the chain
endpoint. No prover freedom — the one-hot cannot name a square the `ft` bit did not select. -/

/-! ### §5.8.1 — The FIELD ALGEBRA of the per-cell gate, discharged once for all cells.

`writeCell_of_sat` delivers a congruence mod `p`; these two lemmas turn it into the reference's
per-cell VALUE. Both are pure integer statements over the four indicator products
`A = carry_a·src_a[c]`, `B = carry_a·dst_a[c]`, `C = carry_b·src_b[c]`, `D = carry_b·dst_b[c]`, so
they hold for every cell and every board without further case analysis upstream. -/

/-- **THE SHARED-SOURCE CASE — DEFECT #5, NOW FIXED (the canary polarity is FLIPPED).**

BEFORE: if BOTH pieces carried and BOTH cleared the SAME cell (`frm_a = frm_b`, the "two players
propose the identical move" turn, which the reference explicitly does NOT treat as a conflict —
`Automatafl.conflictResolve`'s doc: "Identical `(src,dst)` moves are NOT a conflict"), the emitted
cell gate subtracted the old particle TWICE, forcing `mid ≡ −old`; with both cells range-checked
into the particle alphabet that pinned `old = 0`, contradicting the carry — the leaf had NO
satisfying witness on a legal turn (a COMPLETENESS defect; soundness was never at risk).

AFTER: `AutomataflResolveEmit.writeCellHead` carries the inclusion–exclusion overlap terms
`A·C·old` and `B·D·(old − particle_b)`, so a shared source is vacated EXACTLY ONCE. This lemma is
that fact: on the shared-source configuration the gate now pins `mid = 0`, which IS in the particle
alphabet — the turn is SATISFIABLE, and no `old = 0` is forced. It is the shared-source
specialization of `cellAlgebra`, which no longer needs `A·C = 0` or `B·D = 0` as hypotheses. -/

/-- **(2) THE PER-CELL REWRITE, RESOLVED.** With the ONLY remaining structural exclusion (a cell is
never both a cleared source and a landing of the SAME piece: `A·B = C·D = 0`), the emitted cell
polynomial evaluates to exactly the reference `applyMoves` rewrite of that cell: a landing piece's
particle, else vacuum on a cleared source, else the old cell kept. Eleven live cases out of sixteen;
the other five are the same-piece exclusions.

DEFECT #5's fix is visible right here: the SHARED-SOURCE case `A = C = 1` and the SHARED-LANDING
case `B = D = 1` are now LIVE cases with a satisfying `midc` (`0` and `pa` respectively), where
before they were hypotheses (`hAC`, `hBD`) ruling the configurations out as unsatisfiable. -/

/-- **THE WHOLE TURN.** Leg R's satisfying row adjudicates `old → mid`; Leg A's satisfying row runs
`mid → new`; the two are joined by a NAMED seam — Leg A's decoded OLD board agrees, cell-wise and on
the automaton coordinate, with Leg R's decoded MID board, which is exactly what the fold-level
`mid_root` public-input equality enforces (both legs bind a `board_root8` of those very columns).
Under that seam the decoded NEW board IS the reference `applyTurn` of the decoded OLD board with the
two decoded moves — the FULL automatafl turn, cell-wise.

The seam is a HYPOTHESIS, not a proof: nothing here derives that the two traces are about the same
board. What is proven is that IF the published mid commitments agree then the composition is the
reference turn — glued by `Automatafl.applyTurn_factors` and the cell-wise congruence
`Automatafl.automatonStep_congr`. -/

/-- **THE DEFECT-#4 CANARY.** The newly emitted board-cell alphabet gate REJECTS exactly the witness
that broke the capstone: `old[0] = 4`, which the circuit's `anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, 5)` would have
read as "carries a piece" while `codeToParticle 4 = .vacuum` reads it as empty. Two-sided: an
in-alphabet cell passes, the out-of-alphabet cell that made the refinement FALSE does not. -/

#guard cg (memberExpr (mid 3) [0,1,2,3]) ∈ automataflResolveDesc.constraints

/-- **THE CARRY CANARY.** The carry gate `carry == sa1·(1 − occ)` REJECTS a prover who claims the
piece journeyed while its line was occluded: with `sa1 = 1` and `occ = 1` the only satisfying carry
is `0`, so the forged `carry = 1` fails. -/

#guard canonCarryExpr.eval canonCarryForge != 0    -- occluded but carry claimed: REJECTED

/-- **THE FLOW-THROUGH CANARY.** `ft` rides `not_bit(bnz)`: a prover who wants the chain bonus must
claim the square ahead is VACATING. Claiming `¬bnz` while `bnz = 1` fails the pin, so a piece can
never flow through a square that still holds a piece. -/

#guard canonFtExpr.eval canonFtForge != 0    -- bnz = 1 with nBnz = 1 claimed: REJECTED

/-- **THE DESTINATION-ONE-HOT CANARY.** The landing selector is pinned to the INTERPOLATED
destination `to_own + ft·(to_other − to_own)`. With `ft = 0` and `ty_a = 1` the only satisfying
selector is `1`: a prover cannot land the piece on a square the `ft` bit did not select. -/
def canonDstExpr : EmittedExpr :=
  headToExpr (((Head.lin 0 (wDstRow 0 0)).addLin 1 (wDstRow 0 1)).append
    ((destHead (cTy (mvBase 0)) (cTy (mvBase 1)) cFtA).scale (-1)))

#guard canonDstExpr.eval canonDstGood == 0     -- ft = 0: the piece lands on its OWN `to`
#guard canonDstExpr.eval canonDstForge != 0    -- landing square forged away from `to`: REJECTED

/-- **THE DEFECT-#5 CANARY, POLARITY FLIPPED (the completeness fix, witnessed).** On the
identical-move turn (`frm_a = frm_b`, both carrying) the emitted cell gate USED TO subtract the
source particle twice, so the only satisfying `mid` at the shared source was `−old` — out of the
particle alphabet for every non-vacuum source, i.e. NO witness on a legal turn.

With the inclusion–exclusion overlap terms the shared source vacates ONCE: the honest `mid = 0`
now satisfies BOTH the cell gate and the alphabet gate. Two-sided, in both directions:

* GOOD — `mid[0] = 0` (vacated once): cell gate `== 0` AND alphabet gate `== 0`. The turn the
  descriptor previously could not prove is now PROVABLE.
* FORGE (i) — the OLD forced value `mid[0] = −1` is now REJECTED by the cell gate (so the fix did
  not merely widen the gate: it MOVED the pinned value).
* FORGE (ii) — `mid[0] = 1` (the source not vacated at all) is REJECTED: soundness intact, the
  cell is still pinned to exactly one value. -/

#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonDoubleForgeKeep != 0  -- source not vacated: REJECTED

/-- **THE SHARED-LANDING CANARY.** The other half of the inclusion–exclusion: both pieces landing on
the SAME square (the identical move's destination) deposits exactly ONE particle, not two. -/
