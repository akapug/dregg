# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectActionBindingRung2 — the RUNG-2 discharge of the Burn schema's
BALANCE no-forgery on the PUBLIC INPUTS (`burnDesc`), closing the transition-zerofier last-row escape.

## What Rung 1 leaves (`EffectActionBindingRefine.lean`)

The BINDING half of the effect-action family is already CLOSED at Rung 1 as a genuine no-forgery IFF:
`revoke_satisfied2_iff` proves `Satisfied2 ⟺ EffectActionBinds t 10` — the accept-set is EXACTLY the
traces that faithfully carry the published parameter tuple in every row, with NO residual and NO
cryptographic carrier (this family has no hash sites / ranges / map ops, so no Poseidon2 CR ever
enters). Parameter forgery is impossible; that is DONE_AT_RUNG1.

The BURN ARITHMETIC half is NOT yet at no-forgery. `burn_satisfied2_conserves` concludes
`BurnSemantics (envAt t i)` — the u64 balance identity `new + amount = old` — but only about a LOCAL
row environment `envAt t i`, and only on an ACTIVE (non-last) row `i`. That is a residual on two axes:

  1. it speaks about a *local trace row*, not the PUBLISHED balance triple that a verifier actually
     discloses and that an adversary would forge; and
  2. the deployed AIR divides every Burn algebraic gate by the TRANSITION zerofier (`when_transition()`
     in `effect_action_air.rs`, mirrored by `baseGate_holdsAt`: `isLast = false → body = 0`), so the
     LAST row escapes the balance gate entirely — exactly the DFA `hterm` last-row-escape shape.

## What THIS file proves (Rung 2)

`burn_public_conserves`: a trace that `Satisfied2`s the whole `burnDesc` AND has at least one active
row (`2 ≤ t.rows.length`, i.e. row 0 is non-last) has its PUBLISHED balance triple genuinely
conserved: `new_balance + amount = old_balance` over the two u64 limbs, with the `was_burn` disclosure
pinned. The genuine no-forgery statement: a prover CANNOT publish a non-conserving burn and have it
accepted. It composes the whole-descriptor binding bridge (`burn_satisfied2_binds`: every column
0..15 of every row equals the published input) with the whole-descriptor arithmetic bridge
(`burn_satisfied2_conserves` on the active row 0), transporting the local-row identity onto the
PUBLIC inputs.

## Why the anchor is genuinely load-bearing (this is NOT laundering)

Unconditional `Satisfied2 ⟹ BurnPublicSemantics` is FALSE, and provably so. `cheatBurnTrace` is a
SINGLE-row trace whose only row (= the last row) carries a FORGED non-conserving balance
(`new_lo = 601, amount = 400, old = 1000`, so `601 + 400 = 1001 ≠ 1000`) with the `was_burn`
disclosure set honestly. Because the single row is the last row, the balance gate is vacuous (the
transition zerofier divides it out) while the first-row PI pins still force `loc = pub`; so the trace
PROVABLY `Satisfied2`s (`cheatBurnTrace_satisfied2`) yet its PUBLISHED balance is forged
(`cheat_public_forged : ¬ BurnPublicSemantics`). So the `2 ≤ length` (≥ one active row) anchor is a
REAL filter — the conclusion is impossible from `Satisfied2` alone.

## The discharged residual / "carrier"

There is NO cryptographic carrier here — the Burn schema has no hash sites, so no Poseidon2 CR /
`ChipTableSound` enters (unlike the DFA route-commitment anchor). The residual is the STRUCTURAL
transition-zerofier last-row arithmetic escape, discharged by the NAMED hypothesis
`2 ≤ t.rows.length` (an active row exists). Real proofs pad traces to a power-of-two ≥ 2, so the
anchor is deployment-true; the single-row cheat proves it is nonetheless necessary in the statement.

## Axiom hygiene / non-vacuity

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; the structural anchor rides as a NAMED
hypothesis, never a Lean axiom. §5 exhibits the concrete satisfying witness `burnTrace` (`600 + 400 =
1000`) on which the Rung-2 conclusion FIRES with the genuine values, and the single-row cheat which
`Satisfied2`s but breaks the anchor. NEW file; imports read-only.

/-! ## §3 — Non-vacuity, TRUE half: the Rung-2 conclusion FIRES on a genuine witness.

`burnTrace` (from Rung 1) is a concrete 2-row burn-valid trace (`600 + 400 = 1000`) that `Satisfied2`s
the whole `burnDesc`. It has an active row, so `burn_public_conserves` recovers the PUBLIC balance
conservation with the GENUINE values — not a constant `0 = 0`. -/

/-- The recovered values are the genuine burn `old = 1000, new = 600, amount = 400` — the conserved

/-! ## §4 — Non-vacuity, FALSE half: `Satisfied2` alone does NOT force `BurnPublicSemantics`.

The single-row trace `[badBurnRow]` carries a FORGED non-conserving balance (`601 + 400 = 1001 ≠
1000`) with the `was_burn` disclosure set honestly. Its only row IS the last row, so the balance gate
is vacuous (the transition zerofier divides it out), while the first-row PI pins still force
`loc = pub`. The trace PROVABLY `Satisfied2`s, yet its PUBLISHED balance is forged. So the
`2 ≤ length` (≥ one active row) anchor is LOAD-BEARING — the conclusion is impossible from
`Satisfied2` alone. -/
