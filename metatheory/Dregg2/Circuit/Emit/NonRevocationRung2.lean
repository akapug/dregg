# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.NonRevocationRung2 — the RUNG-2 no-forgery discharge for the emitted
non-revocation descriptor (`nonRevocationDesc`, the `revocation` family), UNCONDITIONAL after the
lower-bound soundness fix, plus the historical witness of the CLOSED bug.

## What Rung 1 gave us and what the lower-bound fix closed

`NonRevocationRefine.lean` (RUNG 1) proves the whole-descriptor bridge
`nonRevocation_nonmembership` : `Satisfied2 ∧ ChipTableSound ∧ RangeTableSound ∧ (sorted, adjacent
spine) ⟹ NonMember spine x` — the queried item is a GENUINE non-member of the committed set (NOT
revoked). Before the fix, that bridge consumed an EXPLICIT residual `FieldCanonicalDiffs t :=
0 ≤ DIFF_L ∧ 0 ≤ DIFF_R` (the STRICT-LOWER half of the half-field ordering). The old half-field range
argument certified only `RL = HALF_P_MINUS_1 − diff ∈ [0, 2^30)`, which over ℤ bounds `diff ∈
(HALF_P_MINUS_1 − 2^30, HALF_P_MINUS_1]` — the lower bound `diff ≥ 0` was NOT forced.

The FIX (now deployed in `nonRevocationDesc`) adds two DIRECT range lookups binding `DIFF_L`, `DIFF_R`
themselves to `[0, 2^30)`. So `Satisfied2` now FORCES `DiffLowerRangeSound` (`sat_forces_lowerRange`)
and hence `FieldCanonicalDiffs` (Rung 1's `sat_forces_canon`) — the residual is discharged BY THE
EMITTED CIRCUIT, and `nonRevocation_rung2` is UNCONDITIONAL.

## The measured gap the fix closed (MODEL-FOUND — a REAL circuit seam, not a modelling artifact)

`HALF_P_MINUS_1 = 1006632959` and `2^30 = 1073741824 > (p−1)/2`, so the single `RL ∈ [0, 2^30)` lookup
overshoots the honest positive window by exactly `2^30 − 1 − HALF_P_MINUS_1 = 2^26`
(`window_width`). The OLD 12-constraint descriptor (`nonRevocationDescPreFix`) therefore admitted a
NEGATIVE window `diff ∈ [−2^26, −1]`: a canonical felt `diff = p−1` (signed `−1`) gives
`RL = HALF_P_MINUS_1 + 1 = 1006632960 < 2^30`. `satisfied_admits_negative_window` records that the
`RL`-lookup-alone bound is only `−2^26 ≤ DIFF_L`, and `prefix_carriers_admitted_forgery` exhibits the
concrete forgery: the queried item set EQUAL to a present leaf (`x = L = 100`, `diff_left = −1`)
PROVABLY `Satisfied2`s the PRE-FIX descriptor against realizable carriers, yet `x` is a genuine MEMBER
— a revoked item forging freshness. The DEPLOYED descriptor REJECTS this same trace
(`fixed_forbids_the_forgery`): its direct `[DIFF_L]` lookup refuses `[−1]`. That contrast IS the
closed soundness bug, kept true on both sides.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The range-argument faithfulness enters
ONLY as the NAMED `DiffLowerRangeSound` / `RangeTableSound` hypotheses; the Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY
as `ChipTableSound`; the exclusion core `sorted_gap_excludes` is unconditional combinatorics. NEW

theorem window_width : (2 : ℤ) ^ ORDERING_BITS - 1 - HALF_P_MINUS_1 = 2 ^ 26 := by decide

/-- **The `RL` range-wire lookup ALONE bounds `DIFF_L` only down to `−2^26`.** From the range lookup
`RL < 2^30` and the binding `RL = HALF_P_MINUS_1 − DIFF_L`, that single lookup forces only
`DIFF_L ≥ HALF_P_MINUS_1 − (2^30 − 1) = −2^26` — it does NOT exclude the negative window `[−2^26, −1]`.
This is the exact overshoot the OLD (pre-fix) 12-constraint descriptor left open, admitting the
`x ≤ L` freshness forgery (`nonRevocationDescPreFix` below). It is still TRUE of the fixed descriptor
(the `RL` lookup is unchanged), but is no longer load-bearing: the fix's DIRECT `[DIFF_L]` range lookup
now additionally forces `0 ≤ DIFF_L` (`sat_forces_lowerRange`), so the OVERALL `Satisfied2` closes the
window this single-lookup bound leaves. -/

`sorted_gap_excludes`. WITHOUT `FieldCanonicalDiffs` / `DiffLowerRangeSound` as a hypothesis: with the
lower-bound fix present, the descriptor's own diff range lookups force them (`sat_forces_lowerRange`),
so Rung 1's `nonRevocation_nonmembership` already discharges the whole thing. -/

/-! ### §3b — THE CLOSED BUG: the PRE-FIX descriptor admitted a member-forgery; the fixed one rejects it.

The `revocation` soundness bug (now closed): the OLD 12-constraint descriptor range-checked only the
half-field wires `RL`/`RR`, never `DIFF_L`/`DIFF_R`, so the `2^26` negative window admitted a revoked
(present) item forging freshness. `nonRevocationDescPreFix` is that exact pre-fix descriptor, kept as a
TRUE historical witness. The model-found forgery: the queried item set EQUAL to the present left
neighbor (`x = LEAF_L = 100`), so `diff_left = x − L − 1 = −1`, a canonical felt `p−1` whose range-wire
`RL = HALF_P_MINUS_1 + 1 = 1006632960 < 2^30` decomposes into 30 bits. It PROVABLY `Satisfied2`s the
PRE-FIX descriptor (`prefix_cheat_sat`) yet is a genuine member — but does NOT `Satisfied2` the deployed
fixed descriptor, whose direct `[DIFF_L]` lookup rejects `[−1]` (`fixed_forbids_the_forgery`). Same
committed tree/root as the honest witness — only the queried item and the diff/range wires change. -/

leaks — a revoked item can forge freshness (`prefix_carriers_admitted_forgery`). Retained as a TRUE
