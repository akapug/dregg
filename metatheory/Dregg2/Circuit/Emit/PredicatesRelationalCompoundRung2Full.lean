# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.PredicatesRelationalCompoundRung2Full — the FULL-forgery accounting for the
emitted relational-predicate descriptor (`relationalPredicateDesc`): what the Poseidon2 CR carrier
`CollisionFree` DOES close, and the ONE residual it PROVABLY cannot — because that residual is an
EMIT/AIR gap, not a crypto residual.

## Outcome — CLOSED (the emit weld C2b `diff = value_a − value_b` closes the historical residual)

⚑ UPDATE: the emit gate `(R) : diff = value_a − value_b` (C2b) is now EMITTED in
`relationalPredicateDesc`. This file previously argued the "relation over committed values" residual
was crypto-terminal and un-closeable at the emit level (`forge_binds_unequal_committed`); with C2b that
residual is CLOSED. `eq_relation_over_committed` (§2) proves `va = vb` UNCONDITIONALLY (no re-assumed
`diffGate`), and `decoupled_forge_rejected` (§3) machine-checks that the once-accepting decoupling
forge (`value_a = 5`, `value_b = 3`, `diff = 0`) is now REJECTED by the active-row weld gate.

## Historical framing (retained below for context)


`PredicatesRelationalCompoundRung2.relational_commit_binds` (the committed RUNG 2) already discharges
the crypto slice UNCONDITIONALLY and with a genuine reference anchor: under `CollisionFree` the
trace's committed `(value, blinding)` pairs are FORCED equal to the reference opening of the public
commitments — the prover cannot equivocate on the committed values. That IS the commitment-binding
no-forgery, and it is FULL (no re-assumed residual): the "crypto slice" is closed.

The FULL security property one would WANT — "the value the public commitment BINDS satisfies the
claimed relation" (for the EQ mode: `value_a = value_b`) — needs ONE more link:

    (R)   diff = value_a − value_b          -- col 4  =  col 0 − col 2

RUNG 1 gives `eq_flag = 1 ⟹ diff = 0`; RUNG 2 gives `value_a = va, value_b = vb`; so `(R)` would
close `va = vb`. But `(R)` is NOT enforced by the emitted `relationalPredicateDesc` NOR by the Rust
hand-AIR `circuit/src/dsl/predicates/relational.rs` (the witness generator computes `diff = value_a −
value_b` off-circuit at `relational.rs:425`; no CONSTRAINT re-derives it). The value columns `0`/`2`
enter the AIR ONLY through the two Poseidon2 commitment lookups (C14/C15); `diff` (col 4) enters ONLY
through the comparison gates (C7/C9/C10). Nothing connects them.

## Why this residual is CRYPTO-TERMINAL (not laundering, not laziness) — the load-bearing anchor

The DFA-routing template discharged its residual `hterm` because the residual quantity (the last
row's `next`) was hashed into `entry_hash` and FOLDED into the PUBLIC `route_commitment`; a genuine
reference run sharing that commitment forced it via `fold_inj`/`compressN_inj`. Here the analogous
move is IMPOSSIBLE: `diff` is committed to NOTHING. The public commitments bind only `(value_a,
blinding_a)` and `(value_b, blinding_b)`; `diff` has no commitment, no lookup, no public pin. No CR
carrier can constrain a free witness that never enters a commitment.

§2 proves this concretely: `forge_binds_unequal_committed` exhibits a trace over a REAL INJECTIVE
`hash` (so `CollisionFree` HOLDS via `collisionFree_of_injective` — the strongest CR realization)
that `Satisfied2`s the descriptor at height 2 (RUNG-1 comparison gates ACTIVE on row 0), whose
public commitments CR-BIND the committed values to `(5, 3)`, in EQ mode with `result_bit = 1` and the
active EQ gate forcing `diff = 0` — yet `5 ≠ 3`. So "Satisfied2 ∧ CollisionFree ∧ honest reference
opening ⟹ committed value_a = committed value_b" is FALSE even under genuine collision resistance.
The forgery survives the maximal crypto carrier: the residual is not crypto-dischargeable. §3
(`forge_violates_diffGate`) shows the missing gate `(R)` is exactly the discriminator — it FAILS on
this accepted forge (`0 ≠ 5 − 3`), so `(R)` is load-bearing, not free.

## The exact emit fix, and the proof it closes FULL (§4)

`eq_relation_over_committed_if_diffGate`: adding the single arithmetic gate `(R)` on the active row
(`diff − (value_a − value_b) = 0`), combined with RUNG 1 (`eqRel`) + RUNG 2 (`relational_commit_binds`),
UNCONDITIONALLY closes `va = vb` — the relation over the cryptographically-committed values. `(R)` is
the precise, minimal emit/AIR addition (add the gate to `relationalConstraints`, or gate the
comparison directly on the value columns). `honest_relation_fires` discharges every hypothesis
(including `(R)`) from a concrete honest trace (`value_a = value_b = 5`) over an injective hash and
FIRES the conclusion, so the closure theorem is non-vacuous (hypotheses jointly satisfiable), and
`honest_satisfies_diffGate` shows `(R)` holds on the honest trace (accepts) while §3 shows it fails on
the forge (rejects) — `(R)` is a genuine filter.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; the CR carrier `CollisionFree` and the
chip carrier `ChipTableSound` ride as NAMED hypotheses, never as Lean axioms. NEW file; imports
read-only (it consumes only the committed RUNG-1 / RUNG-2 theorems and the emit column layout).

Row 0 is an ACTIVE transition row (so the RUNG-1 comparison gates fire); row 1 is the wrap row.
Both rows carry the same assignment. `value_a = 5`, `value_b = vb`, blindings `0`, the two Poseidon2
commitment columns the honest `hash [5,0]` / `hash [vb,0]`, `eq_flag = 1`, `diff = 0` (the EQ claim),
`result_bit = 1`. Instantiated at `vb = 5` it is the honest EQ proof; at `vb = 3` it is the forge
(committed values genuinely UNEQUAL, yet an accepting EQ proof). -/

/-! ## §2 — THE FULL CLOSURE: the weld (C2b) makes EQ genuinely certify `value_a = value_b`.

Before the weld, `diff` was a FREE witness decoupled from the committed values, so an accepting EQ
proof (`diff = 0`) over an injective `hash` could CR-bind `value_a = 5`, `value_b = 3` and still
accept — the relation over the committed values was a forgery no crypto carrier could close (the
historical `RUNG2_PARTIAL` residual). The emit gate C2b `diff = value_a − value_b` closes it: `diffWeld`
(inside `relational_eq_forces_values_equal`) supplies exactly the link RUNG 1 + RUNG 2 needed. -/

/-- **`eq_relation_over_committed` — the FULL no-forgery the descriptor now reaches, UNCONDITIONALLY.**
For any accepting height-≥2 EQ-mode trace against a sound chip table + the CR carrier + a genuine
reference opening `(va, ba, vb, bb)` of the public commitments, the reference-bound committed values
are EQUAL: `va = vb`. No residual `diffGate` hypothesis — C2b emits it, so `diffWeld` derives it. The
conclusion is a genuine security property from three legs (`relational_eq_forces_values_equal` welds
`diff`↔values and forces `value_a = value_b`; `relational_commit_binds` CR-binds the columns to the
reference), not a tautology. -/
