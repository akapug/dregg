# `Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConservation` — the TURN-WIDE cross-cell value-conservation AIR (Σδ=0),
emitted from Lean (law #1).

## The gap this closes (grounded)

The deployed rotated per-cell proof forces, IN-circuit, the *per-cell* balance arithmetic
(`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitTransfer.transferVm_faithful`: debit/credit + nonce + frame),
the no-underflow availability tooth (the after-balance range rib), and the per-cell signed
NET_DELTA public input (`circuit/src/effect_vm/pi.rs::{NET_DELTA_MAG, NET_DELTA_SIGN}` — the
`(magnitude, sign)` pair `extract_net_delta` reads back as a signed `ℤ`). What it does NOT force is
the *turn-wide cross-cell* pairing: a single-cell sovereign proof cannot conclude that no value was
MINTED across the whole turn. The cross-cell debit↔credit cancellation is reconstructed OFF-AIR. So
a prover could publish a turn whose cell A proof shows `−10` and cell B proof shows `+999`, with no
declared mint, and nothing in-circuit forces `Σδ = 0` across them.

This is the *circuit-grounded* sibling of the abstract `Dregg2.Spec.Conservation`: that module
states `conservedInDomain dom deltas := deltas.sum = 0` over an abstract value monoid (the
`Conservative`-color obligation) and proves the algebra (`conservation_over_monoid`,
`multi_domain_independent`). THIS module realizes that same `Σδ = 0` as a concrete AGGREGATION AIR
over the per-cell proofs' published NET_DELTA PIs, with the rejection teeth a verifier relies on.

## The construction (mirrors `EffectVmEmitCrossSide`, but over SIGNED CELL DELTAS)

A turn touches N cells. Each per-cell proof publishes a signed delta `δ = sign·mag`
(`sign ∈ {+1,−1}` from `NET_DELTA_SIGN`, `mag` from `NET_DELTA_MAG`, both already in the per-cell
PI vector and range-checked there). The aggregation trace has one row per contributing delta:

```text
  [0]  asset      — the asset / issuer-cell class this delta moves (AssetId := issuer-cell, the
                    `Dregg2.Spec.Conservation` per-domain index). All contributing rows of one
                    aggregation proof share the published `pi[asset]` (the per-asset Σ partition).
  [1]  mag        — |δ|, the per-cell NET_DELTA_MAG (range-checked < 2^BAL_BITS so it is a genuine
                    non-negative magnitude, not a field-wrapped negative).
  [2]  sign       — +1 (credit / inflow) or −1 (debit / outflow); for a declared mint/burn row this
                    is the Generative/Annihilative supply-change sign carrying its declared amount.
  [3]  present    — 1 for a real contributing row, 0 for padding.
  [4]  balance    — running signed prefix sum  balance[i] = balance[i-1] + sign[i]·mag[i].
```

The boundary pins `balance[last] = 0`: for ONE asset, the sum of every per-cell signed NET_DELTA
(plus the declared ±supply of any mint/burn rows) is zero. A matched honest transfer (`A −10`,
`B +10`) cancels; a forged turn (`A −10`, `B +999`, no declared mint) leaves an uncancelled `+989`
and the boundary rejects. Mint/burn are NOT a hole: they enter as explicit rows carrying their
declared ±amount, exactly the `Generative`/`Annihilative` disclosed non-conservation of
`Dregg2.Spec.Conservation` — the conserved sum is over the FULL row set including them, so a hidden
mint (a `+999` with no matching declared `−999` supply row) is what the boundary catches.

The asset binding (`asset` column pinned to `pi[asset]`) is the per-asset partition: one
aggregation proof certifies Σδ=0 for ONE asset; a multi-asset turn runs one aggregation proof per
asset (the `Dregg2.Spec.Conservation.multi_domain_independent` conjunction, instantiated at the
issuer-cell asset index). Cross-asset borrowing ("pay one asset's deficit with another's surplus")
is impossible because each asset's boundary is checked independently.

## What this is NOT (the live-wire seam — additive, not wired)

This descriptor is BUILT + PROVED here and tested in Rust
(`circuit/src/cross_cell_conservation_air.rs`), ADDITIVE. It is NOT yet invoked by the deployed
`turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs` — the live verifier wiring (where, after verifying the N
per-cell proofs, the verifier would build this trace from their NET_DELTA PIs, prove/verify the
aggregation, and require `balance[last]==0` per asset) is the main loop's serialized handoff. The
Rust side documents the exact integration seam.

## The teeth (soundness, proved below)

* `ccc_rejects_unbalanced` — a LAST row whose running `balance ≠ 0` is UNSAT. This is the headline:
  a non-conserving turn (per-cell deltas + declared supply NOT summing to zero) cannot satisfy the
  descriptor.
* `ccc_forged_mint_unsat` — THE FORGED-TURN TOOTH. The concrete `A −10, B +999, no declared mint`
  forgery yields a last-row balance of `+989 ≠ 0`, so by `ccc_rejects_unbalanced` it is UNSAT;
  while the honest `A −10, B +10` transfer balances to `0`.
* `ccc_rejects_wrong_asset` — a row whose `asset` disagrees with the published `pi[asset]` is UNSAT
  (the per-asset partition: a delta of a DIFFERENT asset cannot be smuggled into this asset's sum to
  fake cancellation).
* `ccc_mag_is_ranged` — against the range tooth, `mag` is a genuine non-negative bounded magnitude
  (no field-wrap negative masquerading as a small positive), so `sign·mag` is the honest signed δ.
