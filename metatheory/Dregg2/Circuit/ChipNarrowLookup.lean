# Dregg2.Circuit.ChipNarrowLookup — E7: the narrow bus is served by the SAME chip rows

The byte-safe proof half of backlog item E7 (by-name zoo re-emit,
`docs/EFFICIENCY-BACKLOG-circuit-minimality.md`). The census (2026-07-18, pure parse of the
deployed bytes) confirmed the graduated-lane idiom is endemic in the by-name descriptors: a
single-output chip site commits the digest PLUS the 7 unused permutation lanes, and those lane
columns are referenced ONLY at output positions 18..24 of the 25-wide `TID_P2` tuple — 387 of
1857 committed columns across the by-name zoo + cross-side/bundle-fold registry members are
lanes-only or fully unreferenced.

The narrow-bus VOCABULARY and LEVER already exist (`NarrowChip.lean`: `chipLookupTupleNarrow`,
`poseidon2narrow` = wire 8 = Rust `TID_P2_NARROW`, `chip_lookup_sound_narrow`,
`siteLookupNarrow`), and the rotated tower graduates through them (`GraduateNarrow.lean`). But
everything there takes `ChipTableSoundNarrow` as a HYPOTHESIS, or builds the narrow table as a
SEPARATE log (`chipLogOfNarrow`). The DEPLOYED Rust serves both buses from ONE physical chip:
`descriptor_ir2.rs::narrow_hist` derives each 18-wide narrow tuple from the SAME
`chip_absorb_all_lanes` row that serves the 25-wide bus. What was missing is the model of THAT —
this module supplies it:

* `narrowTable` — the narrow table AS the 18-prefix of the wide chip table (one physical chip,
  two buses);
* `narrowTable_sound` — THE SAME-ROWS BRIDGE: the prefix table is `ChipTableSoundNarrow`
  whenever the wide table is `ChipTableSound`, so every `NarrowChip`/`GraduateNarrow` conclusion
  fires against the DEPLOYED single-chip serving with no extra hypothesis;
* `chip_lookup_narrow_sound_of_wide_table` — soundness preserved end-to-end: against the
  prefix-served narrow bus a narrow lookup forces the IDENTICAL digest equation
  `a digestCol = hash ins` that the legacy 25-wide `chip_lookup_sound` forces (the lanes never
  entered the legacy conclusion — they ride existentially in `ChipTableSound`);
* `narrow_served_by_same_rows` / `narrow_lookup_holdsAt_of_wide` — COMPLETENESS preserved: any
  assignment serving a wide lookup serves the narrow one against the same rows (no honest
  witness is lost by the swap).

Byte-safe: NO emitted descriptor changes here — the by-name re-emit sweep is the staged,
Epoch-2-sequenced cutover (recipe in the backlog E7 entry + HORIZONLOG).

/-- **THE SAME-ROWS BRIDGE.** The 18-prefix of a sound WIDE chip table is a sound NARROW chip
table — `ChipTableSoundNarrow` is DERIVED from the deployed `ChipTableSound`, not assumed. This
is the model of Rust's `narrow_hist`: one physical chip serves both buses, so the narrow lever
(`chip_lookup_sound_narrow`) and the whole `GraduateNarrow` tower fire against the deployed
serving with no extra soundness hypothesis. -/

conclusion, so the narrowed site forces exactly what the wide site forced. -/
