# Dregg2.Circuit.BindingAirSound — the `TurnChainBindingAir` soundness, PROVEN not assumed.

**What this is.** `RecursiveAggregation.EngineSound.binding_sound` (`RecursiveAggregation.lean:139`)
is a NAMED hypothesis: it asserts that a verifying `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf delivers the temporal
ordering tooth `ChainBound` over the whole chain AND pins the public genesis/final roots. That field
was carried as a *boundary* — the in-circuit soundness of the chain-binding AIR. The AIR census flagged
it as a SMALL, ISOLATED proof: the binding AIR's constraints are simple enough to model denotationally
and discharge in Lean, resting only on the standard Poseidon2 collision-resistance floor.

This file does that. It models the per-row constraints of the Rust `TurnChainBindingAir`
(`circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::TurnChainBindingAir::eval`) as a denotational predicate
`Satisfies` over a list of rows + the four public inputs `[genesis, final, num_turns, chain_digest]`,
and proves:

  * **`binding_air_discharges_binding_sound` (THE KEYSTONE).** A satisfying binding-AIR trace whose
    rows expose the chain steps' commitment roots (`Represents`) FORCES the exact `binding_sound`
    conclusion — `ChainBound` (the ordered continuity `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`), the genesis pin
    (head old_root = the public genesis), and the final pin (public final = `foldedFinalRoot`). This is
    a pure reading of the AIR's continuity + boundary constraints — it needs NO crypto assumption at
    all, so the ordering guarantee a light client gets is PROVED, strictly stronger than assumed.

  * **`digest_binds_ordered_history` (THE CR FLOOR).** Under `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (the single named hash
    floor, never an axiom), two satisfying traces that publish the SAME `chain_digest` and the same
    `num_turns` have the SAME ordered `(old_root, new_root, idx)` sequence — the digest binds the whole
    ordered history, so a same-endpoint reorder is rejected by the digest. This is the only result that
    rests on the hash floor, and it rests on it ALONE.

Non-vacuity is witnessed BOTH ways: a concrete honest trace satisfies (`satisfies_two`) and the
keystone fires on a real chain step (`keystone_fires`); a reordered trace whose continuity is broken
does NOT satisfy (`reordered_not_satisfies`), so the constraints are genuinely falsifiable.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is a Prop
HYPOTHESIS where used, never an `axiom`. Imported into `Dregg2.lean` (in the trusted, axiom-audited closure).

/-! ## 1. The denotational model of one `TurnChainBindingAir` row + the public inputs.

The Rust AIR carries per row `[old_root, new_root, acc_in, acc_out, idx, is_real, real_count]` plus the
Poseidon2 permutation aux block. The acc columns + the per-row hash gate are internal witnesses whose
NET effect is a running ordered digest; we model that effect directly as the fold `histDigest` below, so
a row's load-bearing exposed content is its `(old_root, new_root, idx)`. -/

/-- One binding-AIR row's load-bearing content: the pre/post state-commitment roots it binds and its
positional index `idx` (the AIR's `COL_OLD_ROOT`/`COL_NEW_ROOT`/`COL_IDX`). -/
structure BindingRow where
  oldRoot : ℤ
  newRoot : ℤ
  idx     : ℤ

/-- The four public inputs of the binding AIR: `[genesis_root, final_root, num_turns, chain_digest]`
(`TurnChainBindingAir::num_public_values = 4`). -/
structure BindingPublic where
  genesis     : ℤ
  final       : ℤ
  numTurns    : Nat
  chainDigest : ℤ

/-- The `(old_root, new_root, idx)` projection of a row — the ordered datum the digest commits to. -/
def proj (r : BindingRow) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ := (r.oldRoot, r.newRoot, r.idx)

/-! ## 2. The constraint predicates (the Lean twins of `TurnChainBindingAir::eval`). -/

/-- **`RowBound`** — the temporal-tooth (continuity) constraint: each row's `new_root` is the next
row's `old_root` (Rust constraint 1, `builder.when_transition().assert_zero(new_root - next_old_root)`).
Defined with the SAME 2-lookahead recursion as `HistoryAggregation.ChainBound` so the two align. -/
def RowBound : List BindingRow → Prop
  | []            => True
  | [_]           => True
  | r :: r' :: rest => r.newRoot = r'.oldRoot ∧ RowBound (r' :: rest)

/-- **`histDigest hash acc rows`** — the genuine running ordered-history digest the AIR's digest gates
(Rust constraints 4 + 5) compute: a left fold that absorbs each row's `(old, new, idx)` into the
running `acc` via the Poseidon2 `hash_4_to_1` of `[acc, old, new, idx]`, starting from `acc_in = 0` on
the first row. `chain_digest` (the last row's `acc_out`) is exactly `histDigest hash 0 rows`. -/
def histDigest (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (acc : ℤ) : List BindingRow → ℤ
  | []          => acc
  | r :: rest => histDigest hash (hash [acc, r.oldRoot, r.newRoot, r.idx]) rest

/-- **`Satisfies hash rows pub`** — a denotational satisfying binding-AIR trace: the rows + public
inputs meet the AIR's constraints. The fields are the Rust constraints:
  * `nonempty` — a folded chain has at least one row;
  * `continuity` (C1) — the temporal tooth `RowBound`;
  * `genesis` (C2) — first row `old_root == genesis_root`;
  * `final` (C3) — last row `new_root == final_root`;
  * `digestEq` (C4 + C5) — the public `chain_digest` is the genuine running digest `histDigest hash 0`
    of the ordered rows (the unrolled digest-chain + per-row Poseidon2 hash gates);
  * `count` (C7) — the public `num_turns` is the count of (all-real) rows. -/
structure Satisfies (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (rows : List BindingRow) (pub : BindingPublic) : Prop where
  nonempty   : rows ≠ []
  continuity : RowBound rows
  genesis    : ∀ r, rows.head? = some r → r.oldRoot = pub.genesis
  final      : ∀ r, rows.getLast? = some r → r.newRoot = pub.final
  digestEq   : pub.chainDigest = histDigest hash 0 rows
  count      : pub.numTurns = rows.length

/-! ## 3. The modeling bridge — a trace's rows EXPOSE the chain steps' commitment roots.

A `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf over a sequence of finalized turns has, at row `i`, exactly the `i`-th
turn's rotated `(OLD_COMMIT, NEW_COMMIT)` — which are the `ChainStep`'s `oldRoot`/`newRoot` (the §8
state commitments). `Represents` is that positional correspondence, the honest reading of what the
binding leaf's rows ARE. -/

`final` is the genuine `foldedFinalRoot`. This rests on NO cryptographic assumption — the ordering
tooth + boundary pins are forced by the AIR's continuity / first-row / last-row constraints alone, so
the light client's ordering guarantee is PROVED, not assumed. -/
