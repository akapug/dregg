# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriQueryAdversary` — `εQuery` ATTACHED TO A `Q`-BOUNDED ADVERSARY, and the
# arithmetic verdict that follows.

`docs/reference/FRI-EXTRACTION-FLOOR-DESIGN.md` §5, Stage 5 follow-on. This file closes the
QUANTIFIER gap in the query leg, composes it with the three closed legs over the SHARED oracle,
gives `FriQuerySamplingBias.epsQueryBias` its first consumer — and then reports what the resulting
bound is WORTH at the deployed parameters, which is the part that matters.

## The gap this file addresses

`FriVerifierQuery.epsilon_query_layer` (`:267`) and `epsilon_query_deployed` (`:289`) are quantified
over WORDS, not adversaries:

    ∀ (f : ι → F) (f' : κ → F), farN S.C (4*d) f → f' ∈ S.C' →
      |{(α, Q) ∈ F × (Fin k → κ) | Accepts f' (Fold α f) Q}| / |F × (Fin k → κ)|
        ≤ 1/|F| + (1−δ)^k

The far word `f` is FIXED IN ADVANCE and universally quantified; `(α, Q)` is the VERIFIER's own
honest uniform sampling. There is no strategy, no adaptivity, no query budget — nothing an adversary
does appears anywhere in the statement. It is a DENSITY fact about a product sample space.

That is not a defect of the theorem; it is the theorem's honest content. The defect is that nothing
converted it into a statement about an adversary. §2–§4 do the conversion.

## ⚑ THE CONVERSION, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT ONE

The uniform `εQuery` is EXACTLY the object `hit_cond` (`FriVerifierCompose:190`) consumes: a
DENSITY BOUND ON AN EXCEPTIONAL ANSWER SET. In the ROM the adversary does not sample `(α, Q)` — it
QUERIES the permutation at a transcript point `d` and reads the challenge off the answer `r`. So

  * `chal d r` = the `(α, Q)` derived from answer `r` at transcript point `d`;
  * `Bad d`    = the challenges that are exceptional for the word committed at `d`;
  * `badAnswers chal Bad d` = `{r | chal d r ∈ Bad d}` — the ANSWERS that hand the adversary a win.

`εQuery` bounds `|Bad d| / |Ω|`. §2 pushes that forward to `|badAnswers d| / |R|`, and `hit_cond`
then pays `Q` times it, over the adversary's ACTUAL run, with NO freshness premise and NO excluded
adversary class (the honest prover included — §1.1 of Stage 5 is what earned that).

    ⚑  εQuery^adv(Q) = Q · εQuery

The factor `Q` is not slack: an adversary that re-randomises its commitment gets `Q` independent
shots at a lucky challenge. This is the standard Fiat–Shamir grinding attack, and it is why
deployed FRI ships `PROD_FRI_QUERY_POW_BITS`. The union bound is tight up to constants.

## ⚑ THE VERDICT AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS — a REFUTATION, not a lemma

Once the `Q` is attached, the query leg is worth far less than the pipeline's headline numbers
suggest, and §5 proves it as arithmetic rather than asserting it:

    εQuery(|F| = 2013265921, k = 38, δ = 7/16) = 1/|F| + (9/16)^38 ≈ 2^−30.19

    Q · εQuery ≥ 1   already at   Q = 2^31.

So `Q · εQuery` is VACUOUS — it asserts a probability bound `≥ 1`, i.e. nothing at all — at every
budget from `2^31` upward (`epsQueryAdv_deployed_vacuous_at_2_31`, lifted by monotonicity to
`2^112` in `epsQueryAdv_deployed_vacuous_at_2_112`). **The `~112.6`-bit and `~73`-bit query columns
are not merely unproven through this pipeline; they are UNREACHABLE through it, by counting.** The
query leg caps at `≈ 29` bits (`epsQueryAdv_deployed_lt_half_at_2_28` brackets it from below).

The cause is structural and worth naming precisely: with `k = 38` spot-checks at the honest
unique-decoding radius `δ = 7/16`, the per-run error is `2^−31.5`, and once an adversary gets `Q`
retries no union bound can deliver more than `−log₂ εQuery ≈ 30` bits. **More FRI queries would not
help**: at `k = 38` the query term `(9/16)^38 ≈ 2^−31.54` has already sunk BELOW the fold term
`1/|F| ≈ 2^−30.91`, so the binding constraint is the size of the field the folding challenge is
drawn from, not `k`.

⚑ AND A LIVE MISMATCH WITH DEPLOYED CODE, in the conservative direction. `FriVerifierQuery:304`
reads the fold term as `1/|F| ≈ 2^−31` "at BabyBear" — i.e. it instantiates `cardF` at the BASE
field. The deployed folding challenge is drawn from the degree-4 extension: `circuit/src/
plonky3_prover.rs` `PROD_EXT_DEGREE = 4`, `EF = BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear, 4>`,
`|EF| ≈ 2^123.6`, whose own comment says it "is the denominator of every per-fold proximity-gap
bound". So the modelled fold term is ~2^92 times PESSIMISTIC. Correcting it does NOT rescue the
verdict — it moves the cap from `2^29.19` to `2^30.54`, i.e. it buys ONE bit
(`epsQueryAdv_ext_still_vacuous_at_2_32` with its sharpness witness
`epsQueryAdv_ext_not_vacuous_at_2_31`), because the query term `(9/16)^38` then dominates and is
itself only `2^−31.54`. The mismatch is reported as a finding; it is NOT load-bearing for the
conclusion.

## What is PROVEN here, what is NAMED

PROVEN:
  * `hit_cond_density` — `hit_cond` in real-valued density form: `≤ Q · ε`.
  * `badAnswers_card_le` / `badAnswers_density_le` — the pushforward from challenge-space density to
    answer-space density, through the derivation map's fibres.
  * `epsQuery_adversary` — ⚑ THE DELIVERABLE: the adversary-quantified `εQuery`, over a `Q`-bounded
    `OracleComp` run against the shared oracle.
  * `epsQueryBias_adversary` — the same over the DEPLOYED biased sampler; the first consumer of
    codex's `FriQuerySamplingBias.epsQueryBias`.
  * `epsFri_four_legs` — all FOUR legs over ONE oracle, ONE adversary: the composition
    `epsFri_closed_legs` (`FriVerifierCompose:392`) was missing its fourth leg.
  * `miss_density_of_far` — ⚑ CLOSES a gap the lane was asked to close-or-name: codex's `hmiss`
    hypothesis (`(E.card)/m ≤ 1 − δ`) is DERIVED from `δ`-farness by counting, not assumed.
  * §5's arithmetic: the vacuity of the composed bound at deployed parameters.

NAMED, not discharged (each is a REAL obligation, and none is faked here):
  * `TranscriptWordCommitment` — the map from a transcript point to the word committed there. `Bad d`
    is not well-defined without it; it is a PARAMETER here, never an instance. ⚑ Classified, not
    assumed-open: blocker (a) is PARTIALLY closed in-tree — `WordProofBridgeDeployed`
    (`wordProofBridge_of_embedding`) connects the predicate to `DeployedFriEmbedding`,
    `FriFarnessReconcile` reconciles the bridge's 0-farness with `εQuery`'s `(4·d)`-farness, and
    `FriPositiveRadiusPayment` wires the `(1−δ)^k` payment at positive radius. What those leave —
    and what this file therefore still leaves — is (i) the radii coincide only by DETERMINISTIC
    COLLAPSE (both events empty under `accept ⟹ ∈ C`), not by paying at a positive radius, and
    (ii) the positive-radius payment is VACUOUS at the deployed `friSetupK8` model (`|L| = 16`), a
    MODEL-RESOLUTION gap. None of that is a per-transcript extraction map, which is what §3 needs.
  * `FibreBalanced` at the deployed sampler. §2's clean density transfer assumes the derivation map
    has equinumerous fibres. Codex PROVED that is FALSE for `Challenger.sampleBits`
    (`babybear_sampleBits_not_balanced`). §4 therefore routes the deployed case through
    `epsQueryBias`, whose `+ 2^logN/|F|` addend is exactly the defect. §6 records that the balanced
    hypothesis is an IDEALISATION, not the deployed sampler.
  * The `n % m` ↔ `Challenger.sampleBits` grounding: still no lemma links the abstract modular
    reduction to the deployed Rust squeeze. NAMED in §6, not papered.

`hit_cond` pays `Q·b/|R|` for an integer cardinality cap `b`. `εQuery` is a REAL density. This

/-- **⚑⚑ `εQuery`, QUANTIFIED OVER ADVERSARIES.**

For ANY `Q`-query oracle adversary `A` — no strategy restriction, no freshness premise, no excluded
class, the honest prover included — the probability that `A`'s run EVER receives an answer whose
derived challenge is exceptional for the word committed at that point is at most `Q · εΩ`, where
`εΩ` is the uniform challenge-space density that `FriVerifierQuery.epsilon_query_layer` supplies.

⚑ WHAT MOVED. The hypothesis `hεΩ` is a density fact about the CHALLENGE SPACE (`|Bad|/|Ω| ≤ εΩ`)
— precisely the shape `epsilon_query_layer` proves, with `Ω = F × (Fin k → κ)`. The CONCLUSION is
about the adversary's actual run against the shared oracle. Nothing here is implied by its own
antecedent: the antecedent is a counting statement about a fixed finite set, the consequent a
probability over an adaptive `Q`-query run, and the bridge is `hit_cond`'s tree induction.

⚑ WHAT IS STILL CARRIED. `Bad : D → Finset Ω` is a PARAMETER. Instantiating it — "the exceptional
challenges for the word committed at transcript point `d`" — requires `TranscriptWordCommitment`
(§6), i.e. Merkle extraction. That is blocker (a), unchanged and undischarged. This theorem does not

`2^31`, the adversary-quantified query leg is `≥ 1` — i.e. vacuous — at `Q = 2^112`.

So no reading of this composition supports "≈112.6 bits", and none supports the `73`-bit Johnson
query column either: both sit at budgets where the bound this pipeline can prove says nothing at
all. Raising the radius to Johnson changes `δ`, not the fact that a `Q`-retry union bound cannot
exceed `−log₂ εQuery ≈ 30` bits at `k = 38`. -/

/-- **⚑ THE EXTENSION-FIELD CORRECTION DOES NOT RESCUE IT — it buys ONE bit.**

`FriVerifierQuery:304` reads the fold term at the BASE field; the deployed folding challenge lives
in the degree-4 extension (`PROD_EXT_DEGREE = 4`, `|EF| = 2013265921^4 ≈ 2^123.6`). Instantiating
`cardF` at the extension makes the fold term negligible — and the leg is STILL vacuous at `2^32`,
because the surviving query term `(9/16)^38 ≈ 2^−31.54` is itself only just below `2^−31`.

⚑ THE EXACT COST OF THE CORRECTION, recorded honestly: at the extension field the leg is NOT yet
vacuous at `2^31` (`2^31 · ε ≈ 0.686 < 1`) — it becomes vacuous at `2^32`. So the base-field
mismatch understates the cap by ~1.35 bits, moving it from `≈2^29.19` to `≈2^30.54`. That is the
whole effect. The mismatch is a FINDING about doc-comment fidelity (and it is conservative: the
modelled fold term is ~2^92 too pessimistic), NOT the cause of the verdict. -/

/-- **AND THE ONE-BIT GAIN IS REAL, NOT ROUNDING.** At the extension field the leg is genuinely
still informative at `2^31` — `2^31 · ε < 1`. Stated so the previous theorem's `2^32` cannot be
mistaken for slack in the arithmetic: `2^31` is the LAST budget the extension instantiation
survives, and `2^32` is the first it does not. -/

BabyBear. Consequence: **increasing the number of FRI spot-checks cannot improve the base-field
instantiation** — the binding constraint is the size of the field the folding challenge is drawn
from. This is why §5's cap is insensitive to `k`, and it is the same `~31`-bit ceiling
[[reference-umem-boundary-31bit]] and the felt-width campaign keep surfacing. -/

`L = 1` the bias-aware adversary leg dominates the uniform one (codex's `epsQueryBias_ge_epsQuery`,
scaled by the budget). Composed with §5's vacuity this says: the `sampleBits` non-uniformity moves
the bound in the sound direction and is nowhere near large enough to be what caps the leg. -/

/-! ## §6 — ⚑ CLOSING codex's `hmiss`, and NAMING what remains.

Two grounding gaps were in scope: (i) `hmiss` assumed rather than derived from `δ`-farness, and
(ii) no lemma linking the abstract `n % m` to the deployed `Challenger.sampleBits`. (i) is CLOSED
here by counting. (ii) is NAMED, with the obligation stated as a definition so nothing here can be
mistaken for a discharge. -/

/-- **⚑ `hmiss` IS A THEOREM, NOT A HYPOTHESIS — derived from `δ`-farness by counting.**

Codex's `biased_query_survival_pow_le` (`FriQuerySamplingBias:260`) takes
`hmiss : (E.card)/m ≤ 1 − δ` as an assumption. When `E` is the AGREEMENT set of a `δ`-far word —
which is what the FRI spot-check survival event actually is — that hypothesis FOLLOWS: agreement and
disagreement partition the index set, so `δ`-farness (`disagree > δ·|κ|`) forces
`|agree| < (1−δ)·|κ|`.

This removes an assumption from the bias-aware query bound rather than adding one: the miss density
is now a CONSEQUENCE of the farness that `εQuery` already hypothesises. -/

/-- **NAMED, NOT DISCHARGED — the transcript→committed-word map.**

`Bad d` in §3 is "the challenges exceptional for the word committed at transcript point `d`". That
phrase presupposes a map from a transcript POINT to a word — Merkle extraction/binding.

⚑ CLASSIFIED HONESTLY (verify before pessimism as well as optimism). This is NOT simply blocker (a)
restated: `WordProofBridgeDeployed.wordProofBridge_of_embedding` already derives
`WordProofBridge` from `DeployedFriEmbedding`, over the real `decodeColumn` encoding. But that
bridge is PER-PROOF (`committed : Proof → Word`), whereas `hit_cond` needs the commitment indexed by
the ORACLE QUERY POINT `d`, because the exceptional set must be fixed BEFORE the answer at `d` is
drawn. Converting proof-indexed to point-indexed is exactly where FS transcript-binding lives, and
no in-tree theorem does it. That is the residual named here — narrower than blocker (a), and not
implied by it.

Recorded as a DEFINITION so supplying it is visibly supplying the extractor. §3 takes `Bad` as a
parameter and never instantiates it. -/

/-- **NAMED, NOT DISCHARGED — the `n % m` ↔ `Challenger.sampleBits` grounding.**

`FriQuerySamplingBias` models the deployed query index as `n % m` for a uniform squeeze `n`. No
in-tree lemma connects that to the Rust `Challenger.sampleBits`. The obligation is: the deployed
sampler's index at transcript point `d` under answer `r` EQUALS the modelled reduction. Stated as a
predicate so it can be discharged (or refuted) later against the emitted verifier, and so that its
absence is visible rather than implicit. -/
