# `FriLedgerSound` — why the `@[export]`ed `friLedger` numbers are TRUE

`Dregg2/Circuit/FriLedger.lean` carries the COMPUTABLE ledger and its `@[export]`; it is import-thin
so the FFI archive splice stays cheap. This file carries the PROOFS. It is deliberately NOT in the
splice set (it exports nothing) and so may import Mathlib freely.

Three jobs, in order:

1. **PIN the thin definitions to the modeled ones.** `ledgerP = babyBearP`, `chooseTwo n =
   Nat.choose n 2`, `Nat.log2 = Nat.log 2`. Without these the ledger would be a SECOND model wearing
   the first one's name — exactly the twin this whole exercise deleted from Rust. Each is `rfl` or a
   one-line Mathlib bridge, and each is CHECKED, not asserted in a comment.

2. **Prove the PARAMETRIC theorem.** `ledger_perFold_soundness` says: at ANY config, a word whose
   phase map is injective has at most `(friLedger cfg).goodCount` good folding challenges, and their
   density in the challenge field is `< 2 ^ (−(friLedger cfg).perFoldBits)`. This is ONE theorem,
   stated over the same `friLedger` the C-ABI runs — so the exported number cannot drift from the
   proved number: they are the same term.

3. **INSTANTIATE at every shipped config**, and report what comes out — including where it
   contradicts what we have said in prose.

## ⚑ THE FINDINGS, reported unmassaged

* **The deployed IR-v2 wrap (`logBlowup = 6`, arity `8`) reads `109`, not `112`.** This is
  `FriArityTransfer`'s ~109.84 result, now the ledger's own output rather than a prose paragraph
  beside it (`wrap_ledger_perFoldBits`, and `wrap_ledger_agrees_with_arity8_theorem` pins the
  ledger's `goodCount` to the `14112` that `arity8_perFold_soundness` is literally stated about).

* **"The gnark ETH-wrap runs arity 2, so ~112.6 is the right figure THERE" is FALSE.** That claim
  (`circuit/tests/fri_params_soundness_budget.rs`'s old header) silently assumed the ETH wrap shares
  the wrap's `logBlowup = 6`. It does not: the BN254-native shrink the gnark circuit verifies is
  `create_outer_config` at `logBlowup = 3` (`circuit-prove/src/dregg_outer_config.rs`), and the
  ~112.6 is a statement about `|κ| = 2^6 = 64`. At arity 2 AND `logBlowup = 3` the folded domain is
  `|κ| = 8`, so `goodCount = 1 · C(8,2) = 28` and the ledger reads **118**
  (`ethWrap_ledger_perFoldBits`). The old sentence quoted a number from the wrong config — which is
  precisely the failure mode a parametric ledger makes impossible.

* **`perFoldBits` RISES as `logBlowup` FALLS, and that is not a paradox.** It is the per-fold
  proximity-gap factor ONLY: a smaller folded domain has fewer pairs, hence fewer good challenges.
  The rate is paid for in the QUERY ledger (`johnsonBits` / `capacityBits`), which is where a worse
  rate shows up. The ledger reports the columns SEPARATELY and never multiplies them into a headline;
  any reader who wants "the" soundness of a config must read both columns and the query count.

## ⚑ THE `hΦ` HYPOTHESIS — DISCHARGED AT EVERY SHIPPED CONFIG (2026-07-15)

Every per-fold number here carries `hΦ` — the `M = 1` fiber bound — as a HYPOTHESIS, inherited from
`FriArityTransfer.good_card_le_of_phase_injective`. It was DISCHARGED at `m = 2, logBlowup = 6` from
farness (`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp` §8's `far_fiber_card` + `wrap_fiber_le_one` over the concrete
`friSetupWrapRate`) and OPEN at every other config, including the deployed arity-8 wrap and the
`logBlowup = 3` configs — for want of the RS setups this tree did not build.

`Dregg2.Circuit.FriArityFiberDischarge` now builds those setups PARAMETRICALLY (`friSetupK` at
`|L| = 2^(k+b)`, `|κ| = 2^b`, dimension `2^k`, rate `2^(−b)`), generalizes `far_fiber_card` to arity
`n` (`far_fiber_card_arity`), and PROVES `hΦ` from farness at every one of the six configs below —
four `(k, b)` instances of ONE theorem (`phase_injective_of_far`):

| config                      | arity | logBlowup | `|L|` | `dOut` ⟹ `M = 1` | discharge |
|-----------------------------|-------|-----------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| `ir2LeafWrapConfig`         | 8     | 6         | 512   | `≥ 496`           | `arity8_phase_injective` |
| `ir2LeafWrapRotatedConfig`  | 2     | 6         | 128   | `≥ 124`           | `arity2Lb6_phase_injective` |
| `ethWrapOuterConfig`        | 2     | 3         | 16    | `≥ 12`            | `arity2Lb3_phase_injective` |
| `recursionConfig`           | 2     | 3         | 16    | `≥ 12`            | (same instance) |
| `prodV1Config`              | 8     | 3         | 64    | `≥ 48`            | `arity8Lb3_phase_injective` |
| `zkConfig`                  | 8     | 3         | 64    | `≥ 48`            | (same instance) |

It is not vacuous: `phase_injective_fires` exhibits, at EVERY `(k, b)`, a concrete far word the
discharge fires on. ⚠ Also found there: the `Prop` that NAMED the arity-8 obligation
(`FriArityTransfer.Arity8FiberBoundNaive`) was **FALSE**, not open — it omitted the farness link, so
the constant map refutes it. It had no consumers; nothing here was contaminated.

The theorems below still take `hΦ` as a hypothesis, correctly: they are PARAMETRIC in the config and
mention no setup, so they cannot discharge it — the discharge is per-setup and lives where the setups
live. `FriArityFiberDischarge.arity8_good_card_le_unconditional` is the deployed composite with no
`hΦ` left.

`#assert_axioms` is BLIND TO HYPOTHESES. The theorems below are kernel-clean; that is not the same as
hypothesis-free, and the `#assert_axioms` block at the bottom must not be read as if it were — the
`hΦ` discharge is a theorem elsewhere, not something the axiom check could ever have told you.

/-! ## §1. THE PINS — the thin core definitions ARE the modeled ones.

The `@[export]`ed `friLedger` uses core `Nat` operations so the archive splice stays cheap. That is a
build-cost decision and must not become a semantic one: each core operation is pinned here to the
Mathlib/metatheory object the theorems are stated over. If a pin ever breaks, the ledger is reporting
about a different model and this file goes red. -/

every per-fold theorem in the tree is stated over. `rfl`, so a drift is a build error. -/
theorem ledgerP_eq_babyBearP : ledgerP = babyBearP := rfl

/-- **THE COUNT PIN.** The ledger's core-`Nat` `chooseTwo` IS `Nat.choose · 2` — the binomial the
arity-generic count (`good_card_le_of_phase_injective`) bounds by. -/
theorem chooseTwo_eq_choose_two (n : ℕ) : chooseTwo n = Nat.choose n 2 := by
  rw [Nat.choose_two_right]; rfl

/-- **THE LOG PIN.** Core `Nat.log2` IS Mathlib's `Nat.log 2`, so the `perFoldBits` the C-ABI returns
is the quantity §2's lemmas reason about. -/
theorem log2_eq_log_two (n : ℕ) : Nat.log2 n = Nat.log 2 n := Nat.log2_eq_log_two

/-- The ledger's `goodCount` in the arity theorem's own vocabulary: `(m − 1) · C(|κ|, 2)` with
`m = 2 ^ maxLogArity` the fold arity and `|κ| = 2 ^ logBlowup` the folded domain. -/

/-! ## §2. THE PARAMETRIC PER-FOLD BOUND — `perFoldBits` is a REAL error exponent.

`perFoldBits := Nat.log2 ((|F| − 1) / goodCount)` is a *definition*; on its own it is just an
arithmetic expression, and quoting it as a security figure would be exactly the "a name is not a
proof" move. This section proves the reading: it is the greatest `b` with `goodCount · 2^b < |F|`,
hence a genuine bound on the good-challenge DENSITY. -/

/-- **THE LEDGER'S `perFoldBits` IS A SOUND EXPONENT.** `goodCount · 2 ^ perFoldBits < |F|`.

*Proof.* Write `g = goodCount`, `N = |F|`. `2 ^ log₂((N−1)/g) ≤ (N−1)/g` (`Nat.pow_log_le_self`,
which needs `(N−1)/g ≠ 0` — supplied by `g ≤ N−1`), and `g · ((N−1)/g) ≤ N−1 < N`
(`Nat.div_mul_le_self`). ∎

The two hypotheses are the honest non-degeneracy conditions, not fine print: at `goodCount = 0` the
model says nothing (`maxLogArity = 0`, arity 1 — there is no fold), and at `goodCount ≥ |F|` the count
is vacuous (every challenge could be good). Both hold with enormous room at every shipped config. -/

This is the one theorem the whole ledger stands on. `good_card_le_of_phase_injective` supplies the

the good-challenge density at the config the caller handed in. -/

/-- **⚑ THE PARAMETRIC PER-FOLD SOUNDNESS — the theorem the exported ledger reports.**

At ANY config `cfg`: if the word's phase map is injective (the `M = 1` fiber bound — the NAMED,
per-config HYPOTHESIS `hΦ`, discharged only at `m = 2, logBlowup = 6` in this tree), and every good
challenge folds to a constant on `≥ 2` fibres (the deployed inner radius), then the good challenges'
density in the degree-`extDeg` extension is below `2 ^ (−(friLedger cfg).perFoldBits)`.

`arity8_perFold_soundness` (`109` at the deployed wrap) and `wrap_perFold_soundness_capacity` (`112`
at the arity-2 model) are INSTANCES of this — not separate results, and not one headline reused. -/

numbers are true; the sentence attached one to the wrong object. -/

`14` query-PoW bits (vs `16` everywhere else) is the whole difference. -/

/-! ## §6. THE QUERY LEDGERS — the two columns, per config, and the parity fact.

The `(6, 19)` pin was measured against `(3, 38)` at EQUAL Johnson bits — that is the invariant, and
it is a THEOREM here rather than an assertion in a Rust comment. -/

/-- **SECURITY PARITY, PROVED: the IR-v2 wrap and the v1 prod config have IDENTICAL query ledgers.**
`19·6 + 16 = 130 = 38·3 + 16` and `19·6/2 + 16 = 73 = 38·3/2 + 16`. This is the fact the `(6, 19)`
pin was chosen to preserve (`docs/reference/FRI-PARAM-FRONTIER.md` §1a); the old Rust gate CHECKED it
by recomputing both sides in Rust. Now it is proved once, here, of the modeled configs. -/

The v1 prod config has the SAME query ledger as the IR-v2 wrap (`wrap_prodV1_query_ledger_parity`)
but a DIFFERENT per-fold posture (`116` vs `109`). So neither column determines the other, and
quoting one number as "the config's soundness" is not available. -/

/-! ## §7. THE EXPORT IS THE LEDGER — the `@[export]`ed wire is not a separate path.

`friLedgerFFI` is the C-ABI entry the Rust gate calls. These `#guard`s check it renders the SAME
`friLedger` the theorems above are about, at the shipped configs — so a Rust caller reading the wire
reads the proved numbers, and a wire-format edit that dropped a column would go red HERE, in Lean,
before the Rust test ever ran. -/

/-! ## §8. Axiom hygiene.

⚑ `#assert_axioms` is BLIND TO HYPOTHESES. Every theorem below is kernel-clean; the per-fold results
(`ledger_good_card_le`, `ledger_perFold_soundness`, and every instance that routes through them) carry
the `M = 1` phase-injectivity hypothesis `hΦ`, because they are PARAMETRIC in the config and mention
no setup. `hΦ` is DISCHARGED from farness at every shipped config in
`Dregg2.Circuit.FriArityFiberDischarge` (`phase_injective_of_far`; `arity8_phase_injective` at the
deployed arity 8) — a theorem there, not something this block could ever have told you. Kernel-clean
is not hypothesis-free, and this block does not claim it is. -/
