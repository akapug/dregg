# `Dregg2.Circuit.AirChecksSatisfied` — AIR SOUNDNESS half (ii): the QUOTIENT/constraint check
forces the opened trace to satisfy the descriptor's ROW-LOCAL algebraic constraints.

`CircuitSoundness.StarkSound` (class, 0 instances) carries `verifyBatch accept ⟹ ∃ Satisfied2 witness`.
That extraction splits into two independent halves:

  * **(i) FRI / low-degree proximity** — the committed columns ARE a low-degree codeword, so the
    quotient identity spot-checked at the out-of-domain point ζ (`FriVerifier.TableOpening`:
    `constraintEval = vanishingAtZeta · quotientAtZeta`) lifts to an identity on the whole
    evaluation domain, hence to the OPENED trace on `H`. This is `AirSoundness.FriProximity` / the
    `Dregg2.Circuit.FriVerifier` field work — NOT this file.
  * **(ii) AIR soundness** — GIVEN the opened trace, the quotient/constraint check FORCES the trace
    to satisfy the descriptor's constraints. `AirSoundness.circuit_sound_via_fri` proves `CircuitSound`
    modulo `FriProximity` at a TOY VM (`Step State Effect`, an additive counter). THIS FILE is half
    (ii) at the DEPLOYED descriptor (`DescriptorIR2.EffectVmDescriptor2`, the v2 constraint grammar),
    connecting the quotient acceptance to the REAL `Satisfied2` fields, field by field.

## What "AIR acceptance on an opened trace" means for the deployed descriptor

The deployed p3 AIR verifier, per table, opens a QUOTIENT and checks the identity
`combinedConstraint = zerofier · quotient` (`FriVerifier.TableOpening.constraintEval =
vanishingAtZeta · quotientAtZeta`), recomputing the zerofier (`vanishingAtZeta + 1 = ζ^{2^db}`) so it
is not trusted. Its SOUNDNESS content, delivered by half (i) onto the opened trace, is: for each
declared constraint `c` there is an opened quotient value `quot i c` with

    arithResidual (envAt t i) … c  =  zerofier i · quot i c        (the quotient identity), and
    zerofier i = 0  for every trace row  i < t.rows.length          (the rows are roots of `Z_H`).

`arithResidual` is the SINGLE field element the deployed `builder.assert_zero(…)` vanishes for the
ARITHMETIC constraint forms (`base` gates / transitions / boundary / pi-binding, and the two-row
`windowGate`); it is `0` by construction for the interaction-bus kinds (`lookup` / `memOp` / `mapOp` /
`umemOp` / `proofBind`), whose soundness is NOT a row-local polynomial but the LogUp / table AIRs.
`MainAirAccept` bundles the identity + the domain fact; `mul_zero` then forces `arithResidual i c = 0`
at every trace row, and the arithmetic bridge turns that into the `Satisfied2` per-row denotation.

## Correspondence AIR-acceptance ↔ `Satisfied2` (which field rides which check)

  * `rowConstraints` on ARITHMETIC arms (`base`/`windowGate`)   — the MAIN-table quotient check. PROVED.
  * `rowConstraints` on `lookup`                                — the LogUp grand-product / interaction
        bus (`logupCumSum = 0`). NAMED dependency (LogUp permutation-argument soundness).
  * `rowConstraints` on `mapOp`                                 — the map-ops table AIR (Merkle-root
        recomposition) + its lookup. NAMED dependency (map-ops-table soundness).
  * `rowConstraints` on `memOp`/`umemOp`/`proofBind`           — `True` row-locally (content is global).
  * `rowHashes`                                                 — in-row Poseidon2 sites (arithmetic) OR
        the graduated Poseidon2 CHIP-table lookups. NAMED dependency (chip-table soundness) once
        graduated; the deployed `demoV2` has `hashSites = []`.
  * `rowRanges`                                                 — the range-TABLE lookup (or in-row
        bit-decomposition). NAMED dependency (`RangeTableSound`).
  * `memAddrsNodup`                                             — the memory-table sorted-address
        preprocessing / boundary. NAMED dependency.
  * `memClosed`                                                 — the memory address-inclusion bus. NAMED.
  * `memDisciplined`                                            — the memory-table per-row AIR (needs
        `memTableFaithful` first). NAMED.
  * `memBalanced` (`MemCheck`)                                  — the LogUp multiset balance
        (`logupCumSum = 0`). NAMED dependency (the LogUp permutation-argument soundness — the exact
        `permOutZ` scar zone: a bus "balanced" at a constant-zero permutation).
  * `memTableFaithful` / `mapTableFaithful`                     — the ASSEMBLY binding the aux tables to
        the gathered trace logs. NAMED dependency (table-assembly faithfulness — the `Satisfied2Faithful`
        failure mode; NOT faked here).

## HONEST SCOPE

The AIR quotient check on the opened trace PROVES the ARITHMETIC arms of `rowConstraints` (the
`base`/`windowGate` gates — the actual per-row VM-step algebra). It does NOT force the `lookup`/`mapOp`
arms, `rowRanges`, or any of the six memory/map-table legs: those ride the NAMED LogUp
permutation-argument / range-table / map-ops-table / table-assembly-faithfulness carriers. So this
yields `airAccept ⟹ Satisfied2` IN PART — the arithmetic per-row core proved, the LogUp/table legs
carried as EXPLICIT premises (exactly as `AirSoundness.circuit_sound_via_fri` carries `FriProximity`).
No `def …Sound` carrier is introduced; the deferred legs are honest hypotheses, not proved-by-assuming.

## Teeth (both instances)

  * an HONEST all-arithmetic trace is ACCEPTED (`honest_mainAirAccept`) and its `rowConstraints` FIRE
    (`honest_rowConstraints`);
  * a trace with a WRONG arithmetic gate CANNOT be accepted — the quotient identity is unsatisfiable at
    the offending trace row (`tampered_gate_unaccepted`): `zerofier` must vanish there (domain fact),
    but the residual is nonzero, so no `quot` closes the identity.

/-! ## §1 — `arithResidual`: the per-row field element the deployed `assert_zero` vanishes.

For each ARITHMETIC constraint form this is the polynomial the p3 `AirBuilder` asserts is zero on the
row window; for the interaction-bus kinds (`lookup`/`memOp`/`mapOp`/`umemOp`/`proofBind`) it is `0` by
construction — those contribute NOTHING to the quotient, their soundness being the LogUp / table AIRs.
The guards mirror `VmConstraint.holdsVm` / `WindowConstraint.holdsAt` EXACTLY (the `when_transition()` /
`when_first_row()` / `when_last_row()` arms), so the bridge below is guard-for-guard. -/

/-- The ARITHMETIC constraint forms — the ones whose soundness IS the row-local quotient check
(`base` gates + the two-row `windowGate`). The interaction-bus kinds are excluded: their `arithResidual`
is `0` but their `holdsAt` is nontrivial (LogUp / table content), so `arithResidual = 0` does NOT force
them — they need the NAMED carriers. -/

/-- **The arithmetic bridge — a zero residual FORCES the row-local denotation.** For every ARITHMETIC
constraint form, `arithResidual env isFirst isLast c = 0` implies `c.holdsAt hash tf env isFirst isLast`.
Guard-for-guard against `VmConstraint.holdsVm` / `WindowConstraint.holdsAt`, so each case is either the
vacuous guard branch (`True`) or the field equation the denotation demands (`= 0`, or `a - b = 0 ⟹ a = b`
via `sub_eq_zero`). This is the whole content of "the AIR constraint check forces the trace to satisfy
the (arithmetic) constraints", per constraint. -/

/-! ## §2 — `MainAirAccept`: the MAIN-table quotient check on the opened trace. -/

/-- **`MainAirAccept hash d t`** — the deployed AIR verifier ACCEPTS the opened trace `t` for
descriptor `d`. There is an opened per-constraint quotient `quot` and a recomputed zerofier such that
(1) the QUOTIENT IDENTITY `arithResidual … c = zerofier i · quot i c` holds at every row for every
declared constraint (`FriVerifier.TableOpening`'s `constraintEval = vanishingAtZeta · quotientAtZeta`,
delivered onto the opened trace by half (i)), and (2) the zerofier VANISHES on every trace row (the
rows are roots of `Z_H` — a structural fact of the evaluation-domain geometry, recomputed by the
verifier, NOT a crypto assumption). The verifier never sees `arithResidual` directly: it sees `quot`
and the recomputed zerofier and checks the identity — so a tampered gate (nonzero residual at a trace
row) is UNSATISFIABLE (`tampered_gate_unaccepted`). -/

/-- **AIR acceptance forces the per-row residual to VANISH at every trace row.** The core `mul_zero`

/-- **`MainAirAccept` forces `Satisfied2.rowConstraints`.** The ARITHMETIC arms (`base`/`windowGate`)
are forced by the quotient check (`mainAirAccept_forces_residual` + the arithmetic bridge); the
interaction-bus arms (`lookup`/`mapOp`/`memOp`/…) are carried by `hbus` — the NAMED LogUp / map-ops-table
carriers' deliverable, an EXPLICIT premise (the AIR quotient check does not force them). This is the
exact split the deployed descriptor lives at: `demoV2` has one arithmetic constraint (a `transition`,
PROVED forced) plus a lookup, a memOp and a mapOp (carried). -/

outright. -/

/-! ## §6 — the plug into `StarkSound` / `circuit_sound_via_fri`.

`Satisfied2` is precisely the witness `CircuitSoundness.StarkSound.extract` must produce from a
verifying batch; `airAccept_forces_satisfied2` is the half-(ii) assembly of that witness on an opened
trace — `rowConstraints` from the AIR quotient check (proved), the bus/table legs from their named
carriers. `AirSoundness.circuit_sound_via_fri` is the companion single-effect composition MODULO
`FriProximity` (half (i)); the two halves compose to the `StarkSound` extraction: half (i) delivers the
opened trace on `H` on which the constraints are spot-checked, half (ii) (this file) turns that opened
trace's quotient acceptance into the `Satisfied2` fields. -/
