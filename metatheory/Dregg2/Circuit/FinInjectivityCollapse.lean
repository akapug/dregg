# DEBT-B — the injectivity cluster COLLAPSES to a single `Poseidon2SpongeCR`

`CARRIER-CENSUS.md` cluster 2: `compressInjective` / `compressNInjective` / `cellLeafInjective` appear as BARE
HYPOTHESES throughout the state-commitment path. They are NOT a debt — they are collision-resistance, and the
reductions (`Freshness.spongeCompress_inj`, `Poseidon2Binding.compressNInjective_of_poseidon2CR`,
`cellLeafInjective_of_realization`) exist. The one thing that USED to block the collapse was `cellLeafInjective`,
whose `LeafRealization` was an UN-REALIZED carrier (census). R4 (`FinBindsKernel`) CONSTRUCTED it
(`finLeafRealization`, from `encV_injective`).

This file EXHIBITS the collapse: `finCommitSurface` is the DEBT-B state-commitment surface built from a SINGLE
`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` — every one of its four injectivity carriers is discharged internally from `hCR`
(the surface's own `.cmbInj`/`.compInj`/`.compNInj`/`.leafInj` fields ARE those reduced proofs), and the leaf
realization is R4's constructed `finLeafRealization`, not a carrier. Its only remaining non-floor input is
`RestHashIffFrame RH`, which on the reachable denote-image is a THEOREM
(`FinFrameHash.restHashIffFrame_of_fin`). So on the states that occur, the surface's crypto floor is ONE
`Poseidon2SpongeCR`.

SCOPE: this collapses the DEBT-B state-commitment surface (the `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` path). The
tree-wide injectivity uses on the DEBT-A / AIR / `EffectCommit` paths are a separate mechanical routing, NOT
owned here (CARRIER-CENSUS.md). Residual: `Poseidon2SpongeCR` alone (+ `RestHashIffFrame` on the image).

/-- **`finCommitSurface`** — the DEBT-B state-commitment surface, resting on `Poseidon2SpongeCR` ALONE for its
injectivity floor. The four injectivity fields are discharged internally from `hCR` (via
`poseidon2CommitSurface`); the leaf realization is R4's constructed `finLeafRealization`, NOT a carrier. The
only remaining input is `RestHashIffFrame RH` — and on the reachable denote-image that is a THEOREM
(`FinFrameHash.restHashIffFrame_of_fin`), so on the states that occur this surface's crypto floor is one
`Poseidon2SpongeCR`. -/

`leafInj` (via the constructed realization). No injectivity carrier is assumed; the sole crypto hypothesis is
`hCR`. (`RestHashIffFrame` is a data condition on the two states, not a crypto carrier.) -/

/-- **THE COLLAPSE, ROUTED THROUGH THE APEX BINDING.** `CommitSurface.commit_binds` — the apex's
kernel-commitment binding — instantiated at `finCommitSurface`. Its FOUR injectivity carriers are internal to
the surface (derived from `hCR`), so this theorem takes NO `compressInjective`/`compressNInjective`/
`cellLeafInjective` hypothesis: equal Poseidon2 commitments force equal kernels, with crypto residual
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` + `RestHashIffFrame` (the latter R4-discharged on the reachable image) + the SATISFIABLE
`AccountsWF` (aligned-default; `finInit_accountsWF`). This is the injectivity cluster COLLAPSED to one floor on
the deployed state-commitment apex path. -/
