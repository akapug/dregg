# Dregg2.Circuit.WitnessRealizing — shrinking two reducible AIR-census carriers.

This module is a PURE trusted-surface shrink: it takes two carriers the apex/aggregation stack
named-and-deferred — `CircuitSoundness.WitnessDecodes` and `RecursiveAggregation.EngineSound.leaf_sound`
— and DEMOTES each from an assumed hypothesis to a DERIVED/realized fact, with no new axiom. It edits
NOTHING; it imports the two homes read-only and builds the realizers beside them.

## Carrier 1 — `WitnessDecodes` (was: a free apex hypothesis).

`CircuitSoundness.lightclient_unfoolable` carried `WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` as a hypothesis: "any
`Satisfied2` witness publishing `pi`'s roots decodes to SOME well-formed kernel boundary." The honest
content is that the published roots ARE `recStateCommit` (`= S.commit`) of REAL well-formed kernel
states — exactly what an honest prover guarantees by COMMITTING those states.

  * `witnessDecodes_of_genuine_roots` — the REALIZER: when `pi.pre`/`pi.post` ARE `S.commit` of genuine
    `AccountsWF` kernels `pre₀`/`post₀` (at `pi.turn`), `WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` HOLDS — proved, not
    assumed. The decode is the constant `(pre₀, post₀)`; its faithfulness fields are exactly the
    genuine-root equalities + the structural `AccountsWF`.
  * `witnessDecodes_genuine` — a CONCRETE witness over a genuine empty-cell `AccountsWF` state, mirroring
    `RecursiveAggregation.light_client_fires_on_real_chain`: `WitnessDecodes` is non-vacuously inhabited
    on a real recStateCommit-bound boundary, for ANY surface/hash/registry.
  * `lightclient_unfoolable_witness_realized` — the payoff: the apex with `WitnessDecodes` GONE from the
    hypothesis list, REPLACED by the genuine-roots premise (the honest prover's commitment), which the
    realizer discharges internally. The carrier is no longer assumed: it is realized.

## Carrier 2 — `EngineSound.leaf_sound` (was: a free `Forall₂` recursion field), reduced to
`descriptorRefines` + the structural position binding.

`leaf_sound` is `List.Forall₂ (fun p s => verify p = true → recCexec s.pre s.turn = some s.post)
leafProofs steps`. The leaf IS the EffectVm descriptor proof, so "leaf-verifies ⟹ step-executes" is
exactly the per-effect refinement rung `CircuitSoundness.descriptorRefines`; the `Forall₂` positional
binding is purely structural (a per-position fold). We make that precise:

  * `LeafRefinement` — the per-leaf datum: the leaf's descriptor `d`, the per-effect rung
    `descriptorRefines S hash d kstep` (the genuine load-bearing field), and the structural `bridge`
    (a verifying leaf supplies its `Satisfied2` witness + faithful `StateDecode`, and the rung's
    conclusion `kstep pre post` lifts to the step's `recCexec`).
  * `leafStep_of_refinement` — RUNS `descriptorRefines` on the leaf's witness+decode and lowers it. The
    per-step obligation is PROVED FROM the per-effect rung, not assumed.
  * `leafSound_of_refinements` — the structural position binding: fold the per-leaf rung along the
    `Forall₂` (the exact assembly `EngineSoundOfApex.leafSound_of_bundles` uses, but bottoming on
    `descriptorRefines`, not the pre-assembled apex). So `leaf_sound` is no longer an independent field.
  * `engineSound_of_refinements` — builds `EngineSound` with `leaf_sound` DERIVED from a `Forall₂` of
    per-effect refinements; the FRI `recursive_sound`/`binding_sound` legs (outside Lean) pass through.

Non-vacuity (§3): the descriptorRefines rung is realizable (`descriptorRefines_trivial`), the lift is
realizable on the honest transfer step (`honestStep_lift`), and the assembly FIRES on a concrete leaf
(`leafSound_fires`). The one piece not concretely inhabited — a `Satisfied2` witness under an ACCEPTING
verifier — is the SAME audited circuit/STARK floor every module here carries (not a hole, not a `sorry`).

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} on every result. All carriers enter as
Prop/structure fields; no fresh axiom. NEW file; imports read-only.

/-- **`witnessDecodes_of_genuine_roots` — the REALIZER.** If the public inputs' published roots ARE the
surface commitments of genuine `AccountsWF` kernel states `pre₀`/`post₀` at `pi.turn`, then
`WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` HOLDS — the witness→kernel-state existence rung is DISCHARGED, not assumed.
The decode is the constant `(pre₀, post₀)`; faithfulness is the supplied genuine-root equalities + the
structural `AccountsWF` (no crypto, no admissibility). This is exactly "every accepted trace's published
roots ARE `recStateCommit` of the kernels the prover committed", made constructive. -/

/-! ### A concrete genuine boundary — `WitnessDecodes` is non-vacuously inhabited.

The empty-cell kernel (no live accounts, every cell `default`) is the simplest `AccountsWF` state. Its
surface commitment is a genuine `recStateCommit`-bound root, so `WitnessDecodes` fires on the `pi` it
publishes — for ANY surface/hash/registry. The state is the load-bearing concrete part; the surface
stays the abstract Poseidon carrier (as everywhere here). -/

immediate (there are no out-of-account cells to violate it, and every cell is `default` anyway). -/

/-- **`witnessDecodes_genuine` (non-vacuity).** `WitnessDecodes` HOLDS on the genuine empty-cell

/-- **`lightclient_unfoolable_witness_realized` — the apex with `WitnessDecodes` REALIZED, not assumed.**
The single-transition light-client soundness apex, but with the `WitnessDecodes` hypothesis REMOVED and
replaced by the honest prover's genuine-roots commitment (`pi`'s published roots are `S.commit` of
`AccountsWF` kernels). The realizer discharges `WitnessDecodes` internally — so the apex no longer
carries it as a free sibling floor. Everything else (the audited `StarkSound`, the per-effect
`descriptorRefines` family, the accepting batch) is unchanged. -/

/-! ## §2 — Carrier 2: `leaf_sound` reduced to `descriptorRefines` + the structural position binding. -/

/-- **`LeafRefinement Proof verify hash S p s`** — the per-leaf datum reducing `leaf_sound`'s per-step
arm to the per-effect rung. `d` is the leaf's EffectVm descriptor; `refines` is the genuine per-effect
`descriptorRefines` rung (the load-bearing field); `bridge` is the structural binding — a VERIFYING leaf
supplies its `Satisfied2` witness + faithful `StateDecode` to `(pre, post)`, together with the lift from
the rung's conclusion `kstep pre post` to the step's verified-executor transition. The leaf IS the
descriptor proof, so leaf-verifies ⟹ step-executes IS the per-effect refinement. -/

  /-- **the per-effect rung** (`CircuitSoundness.descriptorRefines`): any `Satisfied2` witness of `d`
      whose published commitments decode to `(pre, post)` forces `kstep pre post`. The genuine field. -/
  refines : descriptorRefines S hash d kstep
  /-- **the structural binding:** a verifying leaf supplies a `Satisfied2` witness of its descriptor + a
      faithful `StateDecode` of its published commitment to `(pre, post)`, and the rung's conclusion
      lifts to the step's `recCexec` transition. (The lift at the transfer arm is `s.commits`; §3.) -/

/-- **`leafStep_of_refinement` — the per-step obligation PROVED from the per-effect rung.** A verifying
leaf, through its `LeafRefinement`, gives the step's `recCexec` transition — by RUNNING
`descriptorRefines` (`b.refines`) on the leaf's `Satisfied2` witness + faithful decode (`b.bridge`), then
lifting. This is `leaf_sound`'s per-step arm, no longer assumed: it IS the per-effect refinement. -/

/-- **`leafSound_of_refinements` — the STRUCTURAL position binding.** `leaf_sound`'s `Forall₂` is the
per-position fold of `leafStep_of_refinement` over a `Forall₂` of per-leaf refinements. The positional
pairing (same length, same order — the leg-swap/drop tooth) is purely structural; each pointwise arm is
the per-effect rung. So `leaf_sound` is DERIVED from `descriptorRefines` + this fold, not a free field. -/

engine's whole-history soundness bundle, but with `leaf_sound` no longer an independent assertion: it is
the fold of the per-effect `descriptorRefines` family (`leafSound_of_refinements`). The other two legs —
`recursive_sound` (FRI recursive-verifier soundness) and `binding_sound` (chain-binding AIR soundness) —
are the named recursion hypotheses outside Lean, passed through verbatim; this reduction concerns ONLY

/-! ## §3 — Non-vacuity of the `LeafRefinement` reduction.

Each component of the per-leaf datum is realizable; the assembly FIRES on a concrete leaf. The only
piece not concretely inhabited is a `Satisfied2` witness under an ACCEPTING verifier — the same audited
circuit/STARK soundness floor every module here carries (named, not a hole). -/

field without the full per-effect proof. -/

/-- **`honestStep_lift` (the lift is realizable on the honest transfer step).** The `LeafRefinement`
bridge's lift — "the rung's conclusion yields the step's `recCexec`" — is satisfied on the honest
transfer step by its OWN executor witness `honestStep.commits`, for any antecedent. The residual lives
at the transfer arm exactly as `EngineSoundOfApex.honestStep_lowers` names. -/

/-- A rejecting verifier — realizes a full `LeafRefinement` whose `bridge` premise is vacuous, so the
genuine per-effect rung (`descriptorRefines_trivial`) is the only content needed to inhabit it. -/
def rejectAll : Unit → Bool := fun _ => false

/-- **`rejectLeaf` (a concrete inhabited `LeafRefinement`).** For any surface/hash and any descriptor,
a full `LeafRefinement` over the rejecting verifier: the rung is `descriptorRefines_trivial`, the bridge
is vacuous (`rejectAll () = true` is `False`). The reduction's per-leaf datum is genuinely inhabited. -/

/-- **`leafSound_fires` (the reduction is WITNESSED).** On a concrete single-leaf chain, the structural
fold `leafSound_of_refinements` PRODUCES a real `leaf_sound` `Forall₂` from the per-leaf refinement — so
the carrier-2 reduction is non-vacuous: it fires on a concrete instance and yields the per-step arm. -/
