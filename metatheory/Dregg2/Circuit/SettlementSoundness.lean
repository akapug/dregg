# Dregg2.Circuit.SettlementSoundness — THE SETTLEMENT SOUNDNESS THEOREM (a COMPOSE).

The keystone of distributed time-travel: a verifying finalized batch implies a genuine kernel
transition WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS LIVE *AT SETTLEMENT* — not merely at branch time. Revocation is the
one non-monotone operation; it must be evaluated at the SETTLEMENT TIP (the finalized commitment),
because a cap may be authorized at the moment a branch is spun up and revoked before that branch is
finalized. A light client that only checked branch-time authority would be foolable across a
time-travel stitch. Settlement Soundness closes that: the published, finalized commitment binds the
kernel's `revoked` registry, and revocation is read at the finalized tip.

## This is a COMPOSE — confirmed NOT new math.

Three already-proven legs are wired together; this module introduces NO new crypto carrier and NO new
arithmetic. The three legs:

  1. **The finalized light-client apex** (`ClosureFinal.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound`):
     `verifyBatch (vkOfRegistry Rfix) pi π = accept` ⟹ there EXIST decoded endpoints `pre post` and a
     genuine kernel transition `kstepAll pi.effect pre post`, with `pi.post = S.commit post.kernel
     pi.turn`. The published post-commitment is a BINDING commitment of `post.kernel` — and the kernel
     carries `revoked : List Nat`, the `#139` revocation registry.

  2. **The state-commit kernel binding** (`StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds_kernel`): equal finalized
     roots force the WHOLE `RecordKernelState` equal — INCLUDING `revoked` (the `hRev` conjunct that
     `RestHashIffFrame` lists). So "the finalized commitment fixes the revocation set" is PROVED, not
     assumed: two kernels with the same finalized root have the same `revoked`. (`recStateCommit_binds_kernel`
     recovers the revoked-equality conjunct — the confirmation the keystone rests on.)

  3. **Topology-bounded revocation** (`Distributed.Revocation.eventual_bounded_revocation`): a
     credential revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` is NOT honored by any node `n` at any settlement time
     `t ≥ τ + delay m n`. n=1 / instantaneous propagation collapses the bound to `τ`
     (`immediate_revocation`) — the single-machine principle.

The COMPOSE: leg 1 lands a genuine transition whose published commitment binds `post.kernel.revoked`
(leg 2 makes that binding load-bearing). Settlement evaluates that bound revocation registry as the
node's LOCAL VIEW AT THE SETTLEMENT TIP (`localRevSet T log nSettle tSettle`). Leg 3 then says: any
credential that was revoked-at-origin before the propagation bound is NOT honored at settlement — the
authority is checked AT THE FINALIZED TIP, not at branch time. The branch-vs-settlement gap is exactly
the topology `delay` window, and the tooth below witnesses it is real.

## What composes vs the named residual (precise).

COMPOSES (in Lean, here): the apex's genuine-transition conclusion ∘ the commitment's kernel-revoked
binding ∘ the topology-bounded honor guarantee, with revocation evaluated at the SETTLEMENT view. The
keystone — "authority live AT SETTLEMENT, not branch time" — is the substitution of the SETTLEMENT
node/time `(nSettle, tSettle)` into `localRevSet`/`eventual_bounded_revocation`, made explicit and
witnessed (tooth + collapse).

THE NAMED RESIDUAL (a Rust circuit-lane question, NOT a Lean gap): that the DEPLOYED rest-hash actually
absorbs the kernel `revoked` registry's wire root (the `revocation_channel` / `#139` MDB root) into the
finalized commitment — i.e. that `RestHashIffFrame`'s `revoked` conjunct is realized by the deployed
`RH` encoder at the wire. Leg 2 PROVES that IF the rest-hash binds `revoked` then the finalized root
fixes it; the residual is the descriptor/wire-conformance that the deployed encoder's preimage actually
includes the revocation channel root. That is a circuit-emit conformance obligation tracked on the Rust
side; it is NOT a hole in the Lean compose (which carries the binding as the named `RestHashIffFrame`
floor, exactly as every other field's binding is carried).

## Axiom hygiene.

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The crypto carriers are the SAME named
floors the apex and state-commit already carry (`Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the `compressInjective`/
`compressNInjective`/`cellLeafInjective`/`RestHashIffFrame` CR set, `StarkSound`, `ClosedWitness`,
`logHashInjective`); revocation adds only the topology's `selfDelay` law (already inside `Topology`).

/-! ## §1 — the SETTLEMENT VIEW: the finalized tip's revocation set.

A settlement is a finalized commitment together with the topology coordinate `(nSettle, tSettle)` it was
finalized at — the node and logical time of the settlement tip. The `RevSettlement` bundle carries the
distributed revocation log and the topology so the settlement view is reconstructible. The SETTLEMENT
VIEW is `localRevSet T log nSettle tSettle` — exactly what the settling node believes is revoked at the
finalized tip (the stale-but-finalized local view, the one the §139 registry commits). -/

/-- **`RevSettlement`** — the settlement coordinate for revocation: the topology, the global revocation
log, and the node + logical time at which the batch was FINALIZED (the settlement tip). The settlement
view is `localRevSet T log nSettle tSettle`. -/

/-- **`settledRevView st`** — the SETTLEMENT VIEW: the `RevocationSet` the settling node `nSettle`
believes is revoked at the finalized tip `tSettle`. This is what the finalized commitment commits
(the `#139` revocation registry read at the settlement tip), and the set a credential's admissibility
is checked against AT SETTLEMENT (NOT at branch time). -/

/-! ## §2 — THE SETTLEMENT REVOCATION GUARANTEE (leg 3, at the settlement coordinate).

The topology-bounded guarantee, instantiated at the SETTLEMENT tip `(nSettle, tSettle)`. A credential
revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` is NOT honored at settlement, PROVIDED the settlement tip is at or
past the propagation bound `τ + delay m nSettle`. This is `eventual_bounded_revocation` read at the
settlement coordinate — the keystone substitution. -/

/-- **`settled_revocation_bounded`** — leg 3 at the settlement coordinate. If `cred` was revoked at
origin `m` at time `τ` (`RevokedAt`), and the SETTLEMENT TIP `tSettle` is at or past the propagation
bound `τ + delay m nSettle`, then the settling node does NOT honor `cred` at the finalized tip. The
revocation took effect BY SETTLEMENT even if the cap was honored at the branch that was finalized —
authority is evaluated at the settlement tip. -/

/-- **`settled_revocation_immediate`** — the single-machine collapse at settlement: under
instantaneous propagation (n=1), a credential revoked at any time `τ ≤ tSettle` is NOT honored at the

authority when there is one machine. -/

/-! ## §3 — the FINALIZED-COMMITMENT KERNEL BINDING (leg 2: the commitment fixes `revoked`).

`recStateCommit_binds_kernel` recovers the WHOLE `RecordKernelState` from equal finalized roots,
including `k.revoked = k'.revoked`. We expose the revoked-only projection: equal finalized commitments
fix the revocation registry. This is the load-bearing fact that "the settlement view is determined by
the published commitment" — two finalized states with the same root commit the SAME `revoked` set, so
the settlement-time authority check reads a value the verifier's commitment PINS. -/

/-- **`finalized_commit_binds_revoked`** — equal finalized roots (same turn) force equal `revoked`
registries. The revoked-only projection of `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` (leg 2): the finalized
commitment is a BINDING commitment of the `#139` revocation registry, so the settlement view it commits
cannot be equivocated. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE SETTLEMENT SOUNDNESS THEOREM (the COMPOSE).

A verifying finalized batch + the settlement coordinate ⟹ there EXISTS a genuine kernel transition
whose endpoints commit to the published `(pi.pre, pi.post)`, AND any credential revoked-at-origin
before the settlement-tip propagation bound is NOT honored AT THE SETTLEMENT TIP. The genuine
transition comes from the apex (leg 1); the not-honored-at-settlement conclusion from leg 3 at the
settlement coordinate. The keystone is that revocation is read at `(nSettle, tSettle)` — the finalized
tip — NOT at the branch time the transition was authored. -/

/-- **`settlement_soundness` — THE SETTLEMENT SOUNDNESS THEOREM (compose of legs 1 + 3).**

From a verifying finalized batch against `vkOfRegistry Rfix` (the SAME named crypto floors the apex
carries: `StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR` + the `S_live` CR set, `logHashInjective` inside
`ClosedWitness.mkLog`, `ClosedWitness` itself) AND a settlement coordinate `st`:

  * (leg 1, apex) there EXIST decoded endpoints `pre post` and a genuine kernel transition
    `kstepAll pi.effect pre post`, with `pi.pre`/`pi.post` the published commitments of
    `pre.kernel`/`post.kernel` — a genuine kernel evolution, witnessed unforgeably;

  * (leg 3, at settlement) ANY credential `cred` revoked at origin `m` at time `τ` with the settlement
    tip past the propagation bound (`τ + delay m nSettle ≤ tSettle`) is NOT honored at the finalized
    tip (`honorsAtSettlement st cred = false`).

So a verifying batch yields a genuine transition whose AUTHORITY IS LIVE AT SETTLEMENT: revocation is
evaluated at the finalized tip, closing the branch-vs-settlement time-travel hole. The branch-time
authority (which may have been live) does NOT save a credential the settlement tip has seen revoked. -/

Settlement Soundness is NON-VACUOUS exactly because there is a window where a cap is honored AT THE
BRANCH but NOT AT SETTLEMENT. We exhibit it on the `Distributed.Revocation` tooth topology: a
credential revoked at origin `0` at `τ = 0`, with a settlement tip at the propagation boundary, is
honored strictly BEFORE the bound (the branch view) and NOT at/after it (the settlement view). The
guarantee bites exactly at the settlement tip. -/
