# Dregg2.Circuit.FriSoundness — a FORMALIZATION of FRI soundness from the literature.

**What this is.** `Dregg2.Circuit.FriVerifier` carries FRI low-degree soundness as a
NAMED TERMINAL CRYPTO CARRIER (`FriLowDegreeSound`, a `Prop` class) — it specifies the
verifier ALGORITHM but does NOT re-derive the soundness. This module CLOSES that gap: it
FORMALIZES the published FRI soundness argument (Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev,
"Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity", ICALP 2018 — "BBHR18"; the
proximity-gaps refinement of Ben-Sasson, Carmon, Ishai, Kopparty, Saraf, FOCS 2020 —
"BCIKS20") as actual Lean theorems, resting only on the standard hash floor `HashCR`
(reused from `Dregg2.Crypto.HermineHintMLWE`) and the concrete field/rate parameters.

**The four pieces (all PROVED, no `sorry`, no smuggled hardness hypothesis):**

1. **Reed-Solomon codes + distance** (`§1`). A code is a linear `Submodule` of `ι → F`;
   `disagree`/`closeN`/`farN` are the (absolute-count) Hamming distance and δ-closeness.
   `closeN_zero_iff_mem`: 0-closeness is exactly membership.

2. **The FRI FOLDING operator** (`§2`). Over the coset geometry (`FriGeom`: the ±x
   involution `σ`, the squaring quotient `q : L → L²`, the point value `p`), the even/odd
   decomposition `f(x) = fₑ(x²) + x·fₒ(x²)` gives `E`, `O` and `Fold α f = E f + α • O f`
   on `L²`. `self_decomp` is the fundamental identity `f x = E f (q x) + p x · O f (q x)`.

3. **The KEY LEMMA — distance is PRESERVED by folding** (`§3`, the heart of FRI
   soundness). `fold_close_of_two_alpha`: if for TWO distinct challenges the folded
   function is δ-close to the folded code, then `f` is `4δ`-close to the code
   (the BBHR18 unique-decoding argument — two folds reconstruct `f`; the constant `4`
   is the elementary two-point bound, tightened to no-loss by BCIKS20 proximity gaps).
   Contrapositive `good_alpha_subsingleton`: a `4δ`-FAR `f` has AT MOST ONE "good"
   challenge — the EXACT soundness bound (folding error `≤ 1/|F|`).

4. **SOUNDNESS + the reduction** (`§4`). `query_sound_of_cover` (a query set covering the
   disagreement forces the committed next-oracle to equal the true fold), the Merkle
   binding (`HashCR`: the committed root binds the oracle, `oracle_binding` /
   `equivocation_breaks_binding`), and `fri_fold_soundness` — an accepting-yet-far
   transcript forces the challenge into the `≤1`-element exceptional set OR a hash
   collision. `FriProximity` + `friProximity_discharge` is the interface the AIR-soundness
   unit (2a) consumes: an accepted oracle is δ-close to a low-degree codeword, so the
   sampled AIR constraint checks bind the actual trace (`air_binds_of_proximity`).

**Teeth (`§5`).** A genuine rate-1/2 Reed-Solomon `FriSetup` over `ZMod 5`, `|L|=4`,
`|L²|=2` (`rsSetup`): completeness/reassembly closure are PROVED (not assumed). An honest
low-degree `f` folds into the code and is 0-close; a concrete FAR `f` has EXACTLY ONE good
challenge (`α = 4`) and the fold at a bad challenge (`α = 0`) leaves the code — the KEY
LEMMA bound witnessed non-vacuously. The Merkle binding is load-bearing: a colliding
commitment lets the prover equivocate the oracle (`equivocation_breaks_binding`).

Residual: `HashCR` (the standard hash-collision floor) + the field/rate parameters.
The tight proximity-gaps constant (no `4×` loss, up to the Johnson bound) is a QUANTITATIVE
improvement over the elementary two-point constant proved here — noted, not open.

/-! ## §1. Reed-Solomon codes and Hamming distance.

A code is a linear subspace `C ⊆ (ι → F)` (Reed-Solomon codes are linear); the "domain"
`ι = L` is the evaluation set. Distance is the absolute count of disagreement points
(relative distance = this ÷ `|ι|`; the absolute form dodges rationals with no loss of
content). `closeN C d f` = "some codeword agrees with `f` on all but `≤ d` points". -/

/-! ## §2. The FRI folding operator over the coset geometry.

The FRI domain `L` is a coset of a multiplicative 2-group: `x ↦ -x` (`σ`) is a fixed-point-
free involution, and squaring `q : L → L²` is exactly 2-to-1 with fibers `{x, σ x}`. A
function `f : L → F` splits as `f(x) = fₑ(x²) + x·fₒ(x²)`; the FRI fold with challenge `α`
is `Fold α f (y) = fₑ(y) + α·fₒ(y)` — equivalently, the value at `α` of the line through
`(x, f x)` and `(σ x, f (σ x))`. `FriGeom` bundles the geometry; `rep` picks a fiber
representative so `E`/`O`/`Fold`/`unfoldF` are definable. -/

/-! ## §3. THE KEY LEMMA — distance preservation under folding (the heart of FRI soundness).

BBHR18's soundness rests on: *a function FAR from the code stays far after folding, for
all but a vanishing fraction of challenges.* We prove the elementary two-point form (the
unique-decoding regime): if TWO distinct challenges both fold `f` δ-close to `C'`, the two
folds reconstruct a single codeword `4δ`-close to `f`. Hence a `4δ`-far `f` has at most ONE

/-- **THE KEY LEMMA (distance preservation, two-point / unique-decoding form).**
If `Fold α₁ f` and `Fold α₂ f` are both `d`-close to the folded code `C'` for DISTINCT
challenges `α₁ ≠ α₂`, then `f` is `4d`-close to the domain code `C`.

*Proof (BBHR18, the reconstruction argument).* Let `g₁, g₂ ∈ C'` witness the closeness,
`Tᵢ = disagree(Fold αᵢ f, gᵢ)` (`|Tᵢ| ≤ d`). Off `T₁ ∪ T₂` the two fold equations
`E f + αᵢ·O f = gᵢ` solve (Vandermonde, `α₁ ≠ α₂`) to `O f = Go`, `E f = Ge`, where
`Go = (α₁-α₂)⁻¹·(g₁-g₂)`, `Ge = (α₁-α₂)⁻¹·(α₁·g₂-α₂·g₁)` are in `C'` (linearity). Then
`h := unfoldF Ge Go ∈ C` (reassembly closure) agrees with `f` off `q⁻¹(T₁∪T₂)` by
`self_decomp`; that preimage has `≤ 2·|T₁∪T₂| ≤ 4d` points. -/

/-! ## §4. Query-phase soundness, Merkle binding, and the FRI soundness reduction.

The commit phase (§3) leaves the prover with a folded oracle it must OPEN consistently.
The query phase samples points `y ∈ L²` and checks `f'(y) = Fold α f (y)` from the opened
values. Two ingredients close soundness:

* **Query coverage** (`query_sound_of_cover`): if the sampled set covers the disagreement
  `disagree(f', Fold α f)` and every check passes, the committed next-oracle EQUALS the
  true fold. (The probabilistic "coverage w.h.p." is the `(1-γ)ˢ` soundness term; here it
  is the deterministic core.)
* **Merkle binding** (`oracle_binding`, reusing `HashCR`): the committed root binds the
  oracle — the prover cannot open one root to two different functions, so the queried
  values ARE `f`'s / `f'`'s values (no equivocation). Without `HashCR` the prover
  equivocates (`equivocation_breaks_binding`) and soundness FAILS. -/

/-- **Query soundness (coverage core).** If the query set `Q` covers `disagree(f', Fold α f)`
and every queried point passes the fold check, then `f' = Fold α f` as functions. -/
theorem query_sound_of_cover {f : ι → F} {f' : κ → F} {α : F} (Q : Finset κ)

/-- The committed oracle: a Merkle-style commitment of the WHOLE evaluation function
(the root binds `f : ι → F`). `oracleCommit cr f` is the root; `oracleOpens cr root f`
says `f` is the committed function. -/
abbrev OracleCR (F ι Digest : Type*) := CommitReveal Unit (ι → F) Digest

/-- **MERKLE BINDING (reused `HashCR`).** Under collision resistance, the committed root
binds the oracle: two functions opening the same root are equal. The prover cannot
equivocate the values the verifier queries. -/

  Dregg2.Crypto.HermineHintMLWE.commitment_binding cr hcr root () f f' ho ho'

/-- **Equivocation BREAKS binding.** If the prover opens ONE root to two DISTINCT oracles
`f ≠ f'`, it witnesses a hash collision — `HashCR` fails. This is the load-bearing role of
the Merkle commitment: without it the prover swaps the oracle after seeing the challenge. -/

/-- **FRI SINGLE-FOLD SOUNDNESS (the reduction).** Given a genuinely far oracle `f ∉ C`,
an accepting transcript — the committed next-oracle `f'` opened under a binding root, the
query set covering the disagreement with all checks passing, and `f'` a codeword of `C'`
(final low-degree check) — FORCES the challenge `α` into the exceptional set
`{β | Fold β f ∈ C'}`, which is a subsingleton (`≤ 1` element). So the probability an
honest verifier accepts a far oracle is `≤ 1/|F|`: EITHER `α` is the single exceptional
challenge, OR (had `f'` been equivocated) `HashCR` is broken. -/

/-! ## §4b. The `FriProximity` interface (consumed by the AIR-soundness unit 2a).

The AIR-soundness unit needs exactly ONE fact from FRI: *the committed trace is δ-close to
a low-degree codeword*, so that checking the AIR constraint at sampled points binds the
ACTUAL (low-degree) trace. `FriProximity S f d` IS that fact; `friProximity_discharge`
derives it from an accepting FRI transcript (conditioned on the generic — non-exceptional —
challenge), and `air_binds_of_proximity` is the payoff the AIR checks rest on. -/

/-- **`FriProximity`** — the interface unit 2a names: the oracle `f` is `d`-close to the
low-degree Reed-Solomon code `S.C`. (The whole point of running FRI on a committed trace.) -/
def FriProximity (S : FriSetup F ι κ) (d : ℕ) (f : ι → F) : Prop := closeN S.C d f

/-- **`friProximity_discharge`.** An accepting FRI transcript whose challenge `α` is NOT the
(≤1) exceptional one discharges `FriProximity`: the oracle is `0`-close, i.e. an actual
codeword. (The `≤ 1/|F|` chance `α` IS exceptional is the soundness error; conditioned on
the generic challenge, accept ⟹ low-degree.) -/
theorem friProximity_discharge {f : ι → F} {f' : κ → F} {α : F} (Q : Finset κ)
    (hcover : disagree f' (Fold S.geom α f) ⊆ Q)
    (hpass : ∀ y ∈ Q, f' y = Fold S.geom α f y)
    (hfinal : f' ∈ S.C')
    (hgeneric : Fold S.geom α f ∈ S.C' → f ∈ S.C) :
    FriProximity S 0 f := by
  have heq : f' = Fold S.geom α f := query_sound_of_cover S Q hcover hpass
  have : Fold S.geom α f ∈ S.C' := heq ▸ hfinal
  exact closeN_zero_iff_mem.mpr (hgeneric this)

/-- **`air_binds_of_proximity` — the AIR payoff.** If `f` is `d`-close to `S.C` (FRI
proximity) and the AIR constraint holds on every low-degree codeword, then there is a
codeword `g` the trace matches on all but `≤ d` points AND which satisfies the constraint:
the sampled AIR checks bind the actual low-degree trace `g`, not the raw oracle `f`. -/
theorem air_binds_of_proximity {f : ι → F} {d : ℕ} (hp : FriProximity S d f)
    (constraint : (ι → F) → Prop) (hconstr : ∀ g ∈ S.C, constraint g) :
    ∃ g ∈ S.C, (disagree f g).card ≤ d ∧ constraint g := by
  obtain ⟨g, hg, hc⟩ := hp
  exact ⟨g, hg, hc, hconstr g hg⟩

/-! ## §4c. Multi-round soundness (the commit-phase chain).

FRI folds `r` times. The per-round result (`exceptional_subsingleton`) says each round's
folding challenge is exceptional (folds a far oracle into the code) for `≤ 1` value. So if
`f₀` is far but the final oracle is a codeword and every fold is query-consistent, SOME
round's challenge was exceptional. The pure-`Prop` chain lemma isolates the induction; the
per-round `step` hypothesis is exactly the contrapositive of the KEY LEMMA discharged
above (`α_i` not exceptional ⟹ farness propagates one more round). -/

/-- **Farness propagates down the fold chain.** `P i` = "the round-`i` oracle is a codeword
of its code". If far at the top (`¬ P 0`) and each non-exceptional round keeps it far
(`step`: round-`i`'s challenge is not the exceptional one, so farness survives one more
fold), then it is far at the bottom (`¬ P n`) — contradicting the final low-degree check.
So an accepting far transcript needs an exceptional round (probability `≤ 1/|F|` each, by
`exceptional_subsingleton`; union `≤ n/|F|` over the `n` rounds). -/
theorem far_propagates_chain (P : ℕ → Prop) (n : ℕ)
    (step : ∀ i, i < n → ¬ P i → ¬ P (i + 1))
    (h0 : ¬ P 0) : ¬ P n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => exact h0
  | succ m ih =>
    have hm : ¬ P m := ih (fun i hi => step i (Nat.lt_succ_of_lt hi))

/-! ## §5. TEETH — a genuine Reed-Solomon `FriSetup` and the non-vacuity witnesses.

`ZMod 5`, `L = {1,2,3,4}` (the nonzero elements = a multiplicative group of order 4),
`L² = {1,4}`. Squaring `q`, negation `σ`, values `p`, section `rep` are the REAL coset
geometry. `C` = evaluations of `a + b·x` (deg `< 2`, rate `1/2`, min-distance `3`); `C'` =
constants (deg `< 1`). The RS closure facts (`unfold_closed`, `foldE_mem`, `foldO_mem`) are
PROVED, not assumed — so `rsSetup` is a real Reed-Solomon FRI instance, not a shell. -/
