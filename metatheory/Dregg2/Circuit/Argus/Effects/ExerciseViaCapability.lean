# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.ExerciseViaCapability — dregg1's `Effect::ExerciseViaCapability`
  (act THROUGH a held cap) welded into the Argus IR, on its HONEST hold-gate surface.

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone (the executor IS the meaning of a `RecStmt` term) and validated
it on transfer/mint/burn/createEscrow; the sibling welds carried per-component effects (`BalanceA`/
`CellSeal` to their genuine standalone v2 `Surface2` descriptors, `DropRef` to the per-cell cap-root
descriptor). This module welds **`exerciseViaCapability`** — dregg1's `Effect::ExerciseViaCapability {
cap_slot→target, inner_effects }` (`apply.rs:2441`), the act-through-a-held-cap effect — in its own
disjoint file. It OWNS only itself, imports the Argus IR + the audited `exerciseA` EffectVM emit module
read-only, and edits no other Argus file.

## What ExerciseViaCapability IS — and the layer this weld pins (read this; the surface is precise)

dregg1's exercise is a **hold-gate → facet-mask → RECURSE** composite (`Handlers/Exercise.lean §0`):

  1. (hold-gate) the actor must HOLD a cap conferring an edge to `target` (`confersEdgeTo`); the cap
     graph is UNCHANGED by exercising (it READS, never edits, the c-list — `apply.rs:2455`);
  2. (R4 facet-mask) each inner effect must be ADMITTED under the held cap's `allowed_effects`;
  3. (recurse) each surviving inner effect is APPLIED in sequence against the target — a SUB-FOREST.

The verified executor splits this into an OUTER hold-gate step `exerciseStepA` (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:
1601`) and the inner fold `execInnerA`, glued by the runnable arm
`execFullA s (.exerciseA actor t inner) = if innerFacetsAdmittedA … then (match exerciseStepA … with
some s' => execInnerA s' inner | none => none) else none` (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3811`).

This weld pins the **OUTER HOLD-GATE LAYER** — the bare cap-exercise (`inner = []`). That is the exact
layer the AUDITED descriptor connector speaks about: `EffectVmEmitExercise.descriptor_agrees_with_executor
_exercise` welds the runnable `exerciseVmDescriptor` against `ExerciseHoldSpec`/`exerciseStepA`, NOT the
inner fold (each inner effect is its OWN per-row descriptor, composed at the turn layer `TurnEmit` —
`EffectVmEmitExercise §0`, `Handlers/Exercise §DEFER`, cited). So the honest object here is the hold-gate
outer step; the inner forest is the turn-composition layer, OUT of this per-effect weld (stated, §DEFER).

## The KERNEL-vs-CHAINED boundary (the structural shape, named precisely)

The Argus `interp` is a `RecordKernelState → Option RecordKernelState` transformer; `exerciseStepA` is a
`RecChainedState → Option RecChainedState` step whose ONLY state motion is (i) a hold-gate, then (ii) a
prepend of `authReceipt actor` onto the `log` — and the `log` lives in `RecChainedState`, NOT in
`RecordKernelState`. The KERNEL is FROZEN. So on the kernel, the exercise hold-gate is a PURE
DOMAIN-RESTRICTOR: gate on the hold-edge, return the kernel UNCHANGED. That is EXACTLY the `RecStmt.guard`
primitive (`Stmt.lean §guard`) — the in-band shape of the `confersEdgeTo` hold-gate, freezing the kernel.
The runtime receipt-log prepend (which the `RecordKernelState`-level `interp` structurally cannot emit) is
re-attached at the CHAINED lift (§3), exactly as `Effects/CellSeal §3` re-attaches its lifecycle receipt.
No new IR constructor is needed (the `guard` primitive is the whole kernel content).

## What this module proves (the two keystones, on the hold-gate surface)

  1. `interp_exerciseStmt_eq_kernel` — the executor IS the term: `interp` of the exercise IR term is, on
     the nose, the KERNEL projection of the verified outer step `exerciseStepA` — `if hold-gate then
     some k else none` (the kernel frozen). The per-effect executor-refinement for the cap-exercise layer.
  2. `exercise_compile_sound` — the weld: a satisfying witness of the AUDITED runnable descriptor
     `exerciseVmDescriptor` (`EffectVmEmitExercise §8`, `exerciseDescriptor_full_sound`) agrees, PER CELL,
     with the FROZEN balance the IR term's executor produces (`descriptor_agrees_with_executor_exercise`),
     carrying the per-cell `ExerciseCellSpec` (whole economic block frozen) AND the explicit NONCE-TICK
     divergence as a conjunct.

## HONEST SURFACE + THE REPORTED DIVERGENCES (precise — do NOT over-read)

  * **PER-CELL.** `exerciseVmDescriptor` is a SINGLE-ROW AIR; its soundness pins ONE cell's transition
    (frozen economic block + nonce tick) + that cell's commitment binding. `interp`/`exerciseStepA` is the
    whole-state transformer (here the IDENTITY on the kernel). We weld on the cell's projected FROZEN
    `balLo`, exactly the surface `descriptor_agrees_with_executor_exercise` supports — NOT a full-state
    `Surface2` weld (the exercise hold-layer has no standalone `Surface2`/`EffectCommit2 *_full_sound`;
    its genuine content is connectivity/non-amplification — the AUTHORITY regime `EffectsAuthority §5`,
    `exercise_non_amplifying` — and the conserved frozen frame, not a value/side-table move). The cell
    economic block is FROZEN (exercise moves no value AT THE HOLD LAYER), so the conserved leg is the
    frozen `balLo` directly.

  * **THE NONCE-TICK DIVERGENCE (kernel-freeze vs runtime row-tick — carried, NOT papered).** The executor
    hold-step `exerciseStepA` FREEZES the whole kernel (the cell record, nonce included). The runtime
    EffectVM row TICKS the cell nonce by 1 on this non-NoOp row (`EffectVmEmitExercise §0`, the Stage-3
    passthrough batch's global nonce gate). So the descriptor's `post.nonce = pre.nonce + 1` while the
    executor's projected post-nonce is FROZEN (`= pre.nonce`). This is the SAME structural divergence
    transfer/burn carry (row ticks, body freezes), and on the cap-exercise layer it is left as an EXPLICIT
    conjunct of the weld (`post.nonce = pre.nonce + 1`), reconciled at the turn level by the prologue's
    single tick (`Argus.Nonce.perEffect_nonce_reconciles_to_turn`, cited — not re-proved here).

  * **OUTER-LAYER-ONLY (inner fold OFF-ROW — stated §DEFER).** The weld pins the bare cap-exercise
    (`inner = []`). The inner sub-forest (R4 facet-mask + the `execInnerA` fold) is the turn-composition
    layer; its conservation is the algebra twin `Handlers.Exercise.exercise_conserves` (the summed inner
    deltas) and each inner effect's own per-row descriptor — cited, NOT claimed here.

log prepend (a `RecChainedState` field). So the KERNEL content of the cap-exercise is EXACTLY a

(`Stmt.lean §guard`) is that shape — no new IR constructor. -/

/-- The exercise hold-gate as a `Bool` predicate over the KERNEL — exactly `exerciseStepA`'s `if`: the

/-! ## §3 — Lifting the cornerstone to the CHAINED runnable arm `execFullA … (.exerciseA … [])`.

The audited descriptor connector (§4) and the `exerciseStepA_iff_holdSpec` corner speak about the CHAINED
`RecChainedState` step. The §2 cornerstone is the KERNEL projection. The chained outer layer is exactly
the §2 hold-gate PLUS the runtime receipt prepend `authReceipt actor :: s.log` (the `log` motion the
kernel `interp` cannot model). With the inner forest EMPTY (`inner = []`), the runnable `exerciseA` arm
reduces to the outer step `exerciseStepA` itself: the facet-mask gate is vacuously true (`[].all _ =
true`) and the inner fold is the identity (`execInnerA s' [] = some s'`). We bridge faithfully, naming the
receipt-row prepend EXPLICITLY in the chained post-state (the honest kernel-vs-runtime divergence — NOT
papered, exactly as `Effects/CellSeal §3`). -/

/-- **`execFullA_exercise_nil` — the runnable arm on the BARE cap-exercise IS the outer hold-step.** With
`inner = []`, `execFullA s (.exerciseA actor target [])` reduces to `exerciseStepA s actor target`: the
R4 facet-mask gate `innerFacetsAdmittedA s actor target []` is vacuously `true` (`[].all _`), and the
inner fold `execInnerA s' [] = some s'` is the identity, so the arm is precisely the outer hold-step. This
pins the weld to dregg1's `ExerciseViaCapability` entry point (the `exerciseA` arm), restricted to the
hold-gate layer the descriptor speaks about. -/

/-- **`exercise_compile_sound` — the welded soundness (exercise slice, the cap-exercise hold layer).**

Suppose, for the Argus exercise term `exerciseStmt actor target`:
  * the circuit `compileExercise` (= the audited runnable `exerciseVmDescriptor`) is SATISFIED by
    `(env, true, true)` under the abstract Poseidon carrier `hash` on a row with `s_noop = 0` (`hnoop`,
    the non-NoOp exercise row), and its `RowEncodesExercise` decoding NAMES the cell `(pre, post)`
    transition (`henc`), with the pre-`bal_lo` column reading the executor's projected balance of any
    cell `c` (`hpreBal`);
  * the IR term's KERNEL executor interpretation COMMITS: `interp (exerciseStmt actor target) s.kernel =
    some k'` (`hexec`) — i.e. the actor genuinely HOLDS the cap-edge.

Then:
  * **frozen-frame leg (per-cell):** the circuit's pinned post-state `post` FREEZES the whole economic
    block relative to `pre` — `balLo`/`balHi`/the 8 `fields`/`capRoot`/`reserved` (the cap-exercise HOLD
    layer moves no value), via the audited `ExerciseCellSpec`;
  * **agreement leg (per-cell):** the circuit's pinned post-`balLo` AGREES with the EXECUTOR's projected
    post-balance `balProj s'.kernel c` (here `= balProj s.kernel c`, the executor's frozen kernel), via
    the connector `descriptor_agrees_with_executor_exercise`. So the circuit binds the conserved balance
    the IR term's executor produces;
  * **the NONCE-TICK divergence (explicit):** `post.nonce = pre.nonce + 1` — the descriptor row TICKS the
    cell nonce, while the executor's hold-step FREEZES the kernel (nonce included). This is the same
    structural divergence transfer/burn carry; on the hold layer it is left EXPLICIT (reconciled at the
    turn level by the prologue's single tick, `Argus.Nonce.perEffect_nonce_reconciles_to_turn`, cited).

So the runnable circuit the prover runs for the cap-exercise hold layer pins the per-cell FROZEN economic
frame that the IR term's executor produces, agrees on the conserved balance, and ticks the nonce ONCE (the
runtime row-bookkeeping leg) — the per-effect refinement for dregg1's `ExerciseViaCapability` outer layer.

NOTE (the honest scope): both legs pertain to the OUTER hold-gate layer (`inner = []`). The inner
sub-forest (R4 facet-mask + the `execInnerA` fold) is the turn-composition layer; its conservation is the
summed inner deltas (`Handlers.Exercise.exercise_conserves`) and each inner effect's own per-row
descriptor — cited, OUT of this weld (§DEFER). -/

/-! ## §DEFER — honest scope of this weld (documented, NOT a silent gap).

  * **The INNER sub-forest is OUT of this per-effect weld.** This module pins the OUTER hold-gate layer
    (the bare cap-exercise, `inner = []`) — exactly the layer the audited descriptor connector speaks
    about. The R4 facet-mask + the `execInnerA` fold over `inner` is the TURN-COMPOSITION layer: each
    inner effect is its OWN per-row descriptor, composed through `TurnEmit`, and the summed-delta
    conservation is the algebra twin `Handlers.Exercise.exercise_conserves` — cited, not re-claimed here.

  * **The NONCE-TICK divergence is carried, not closed.** The executor hold-step FREEZES the kernel; the
    runtime EffectVM row TICKS the cell nonce. `exercise_compile_sound` exposes `post.nonce = pre.nonce +
    1` as an EXPLICIT conjunct; the turn-level reconciliation (the prologue's single tick) is
    `Argus.Nonce.perEffect_nonce_reconciles_to_turn`, cited — not re-proved in this per-effect module.

  * **PER-CELL, not full-state `Surface2`.** The exercise hold layer has no standalone `Surface2`/
    `EffectCommit2 *_full_sound` (its genuine content is connectivity / non-amplification — the AUTHORITY
    regime `EffectsAuthority.exercise_non_amplifying`, the cap graph UNCHANGED — and the conserved frozen
    frame, not a value/side-table move). So the weld lives on the per-cell `cellProj`/`balProj` surface
    the runnable descriptor supports, exactly like transfer/delegate, not the whole-state digest surface.
