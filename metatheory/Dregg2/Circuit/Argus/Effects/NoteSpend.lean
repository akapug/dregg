# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.NoteSpend — the HARDEST Argus primitive: the noteSpend
DOUBLE-SPEND non-membership, in-band on BOTH the executor and the circuit.

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone (the executor IS the meaning of a `RecStmt` term) and
`Argus/Policy.lean` built the first Bucket-B CIRCUIT REFERENCE — a real `VmGate` proved equivalent
to a protocol predicate (`sumGate ⟺ sumEquals`) + anti-ghost + a circuit-backed `Verifiable`
discharging the `witnessed` obligation. This module does the hard one the census flagged
MISSING: a **non-membership** circuit gate, for the noteSpend nullifier set.

## Why this is the crown

Today no-double-spend is enforced ONLY in the executor's in-memory nullifier set
(`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:941`, modelled faithfully as `RecordKernel.noteSpendNullifier`). The
running per-row EffectVM circuit does NOT enforce it: `EffectVmEmitNoteSpend.lean`'s
`noteSpend_no_double_spend_is_turn_property` / `noteSpend_freshness_still_needs_nonmembership` state
EXACTLY that the per-row freeze AIR (even with the `nullifiers`-root bound) commits the insert but
canNOT witness FRESHNESS — `nf ∉ nullifiers` is a NON-MEMBERSHIP assertion over the WHOLE set, a
gate-kind the hash-site IR lacks. So a STARK that verifies is NOT a proof of no-double-spend. THIS
file supplies that missing gate-kind, with real teeth, on both sides:

* **Executor side (§1, tractable).** `noteSpendStmt nf` is the cornerstone `RecStmt` term assembled
  from `insFresh` — whose `interp` carries the nullifier non-membership-and-insert INLINE
  (`Stmt.lean §insFresh`: `if n k ∈ k.nullifiers then none else nf :: …`). We prove
  `interp (noteSpendStmt nf) k = noteSpendNullifier k nf` (the executor IS the term) and the
  corollary `noteSpendStmt_no_double_spend`: a committed spend means the nullifier was NOT already
  spent — the no-double-spend is enforced IN THE TERM, closing the "executor-only in-memory" gap at
  the IR level. Non-vacuous: a replay ⇒ `none`.

* **Circuit side (§2–§5, the new reference).** A **SORTED-NEIGHBOR** non-membership gate.
  The committed nullifier set is sorted strictly ascending (a named commitment discipline). To prove
  `nf ∉ set`, the prover exhibits two NEIGHBOR witnesses `lo < nf < hi` that are CONSECUTIVE in the
  sentinel-padded sorted set. The gate is a REAL arithmetic constraint — two strict-`<` checks, each
  realized as a non-negative GAP witness (`nf = lo + 1 + dLo`, `dLo ≥ 0`, range-checked), exactly the
  PLONK linear-gate + range-lookup family. We prove:
    - `nonMemberGate_holds_iff_between` — the gate holds IFF `lo < nf < hi` (BOTH directions, the
      genuine circuit teeth on the columns; the gap witnesses are non-vacuous, coefficients `+1`);
    - `between_consecutive_iff_not_mem` — THE MATH BRIDGE: over a strict-ascending `xs`, a
      consecutive sentinel-padded neighbor pair with `lo < nf < hi` EXISTS iff `nf ∉ xs` (soundness +
      completeness of the non-membership argument);
    - `nonMemberGate_iff_not_mem` — the circuit⟺protocol bridge: the gate (on genuine consecutive
      neighbors) holds IFF `nf ∉ xs`;
    - the ANTI-GHOST: a gate-satisfying witness for an `nf` that IS a member is UNSAT (a member
      cannot sit strictly between its own consecutive neighbors);
    - a circuit-backed `Verifiable ObligationStmt` instance DISCHARGING the non-membership `witnessed`
      obligation (`nonMembership_witnessed_has_circuit_teeth`), the §4 analog of Policy.lean's
      `sumEquals_witnessed_has_circuit_teeth` — genuine arithmetic teeth, not an empty oracle.

## Honesty (what this builds vs assumes)

This is the SORTED-NEIGHBOR non-membership (the prompt's endorsed simpler-but-real reference), NOT a
full Merkle non-membership. It ASSUMES the nullifier set is committed as a strict-ascending list
(`SortedAsc`) under a named root — the standard sorted-set non-membership discipline. What that buys
is GENUINE: the gate's algebraic statement is PROVED equivalent to `nf ∉ set` (sound + complete) with
an anti-ghost tooth, so a fresh-nullifier witness that the gate accepts is exactly a non-member. What
remains for the FULL deployed noteSpend descriptor (reported in the trailer): binding the neighbor
columns to the EffectVM `nullifiers` root via a Merkle/sorted-tree opening (so the `lo,hi` the gate
reads are PROVABLY the committed neighbors, not prover-chosen) — the sorted-tree opening gate that the
4-arity Poseidon2 hash-site IR still lacks. We state that boundary precisely rather than fake it.

/-! ## §1 — EXECUTOR SIDE: noteSpend as the cornerstone term, with no-double-spend IN-BAND.

`noteSpendNullifier` (`RecordKernel.lean:1316`) is the kernel's fail-closed double-spend gate — the
faithful model of `apply.rs:941`'s `self.note_nullifiers` set-insert: `if nf ∈ nullifiers then none
else nf :: nullifiers`. The cornerstone IR primitive `insFresh n` (`Stmt.lean`) has EXACTLY this
`interp` clause. So the noteSpend executor IS a one-primitive `RecStmt` term, and the no-double-spend
lives INLINE in the term's meaning — not in an out-of-band in-memory set. -/

/-- **`noteSpendStmt nf`** — the noteSpend effect as a cornerstone `RecStmt` term: the single
`insFresh (fun _ => nf)` primitive, whose `interp` is the nullifier non-membership-and-insert. The
no-double-spend gate is the primitive's own semantics (no separate guard needed — `insFresh` fails
closed on a present nullifier). -/

  RecStmt.insFresh (fun _ => nf)

/-- **`interp_noteSpendStmt_eq_noteSpendNullifier` — the cornerstone (executor IS the term).**
`interp` of the noteSpend term is EXACTLY the verified kernel double-spend gate `noteSpendNullifier` —
the same partial function, by construction, including the `nf ∉ nullifiers` non-membership check. -/

/-- **`noteSpendStmt_no_double_spend` (the no-double-spend, IN THE TERM).** If the noteSpend
term COMMITS (`interp … = some k'`), then the spent nullifier was NOT already in the set
(`nf ∉ k.nullifiers`). The anti-replay guarantee is enforced inline by the cornerstone term's own
`interp` — closing the "executor-only in-memory nullifier set" gap at the IR level. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE MATH CORE: sorted-neighbor non-membership (`lo < nf < hi` ⟺ `nf ∉ xs`).

The new content. A nullifier set committed as a STRICT-ASCENDING list `xs` admits a
non-membership argument: `nf ∉ xs` IFF there is a CONSECUTIVE sentinel-padded neighbor pair
`(lo, hi)` (with `lo < hi`) such that `lo < nf < hi`. We build a self-contained `SortedAsc`
predicate and a `NeighborGap` witness (so this module depends on NO moving mathlib list API), and
prove the equivalence by induction. This is the protocol-side statement the circuit gate will be
proved equivalent to. -/

/-- **`SortedAsc xs`** — `xs` is strictly ascending (the committed nullifier-set discipline). Direct
recursion (no mathlib `Sorted`/`Chain'` dependency): a singleton is sorted; `a :: b :: r` is sorted
iff `a < b` and `b :: r` is sorted. -/
def SortedAsc : List Int → Prop
  | []          => True
  | [_]         => True
  | a :: b :: r => a < b ∧ SortedAsc (b :: r)

/-- A strict-ascending list of `Nat` nullifiers, lifted to `ℤ` (the committed-set coercion the gate
reads — the EffectVM columns carry `ℤ`). -/
def sortedAscNat (xs : List Nat) : Prop := SortedAsc (xs.map (Int.ofNat))

/-- **`sortedAsc_tail`.** The tail of a strict-ascending list is strict-ascending. -/
theorem sortedAsc_tail {a : Int} {xs : List Int} (h : SortedAsc (a :: xs)) : SortedAsc xs := by
  cases xs with
  | nil => exact True.intro
  | cons b r => exact h.2

/-- **`sortedAsc_head_lt`.** In a strict-ascending `a :: b :: r`, the head is strictly below
the second element. -/
theorem sortedAsc_head_lt {a b : Int} {r : List Int} (h : SortedAsc (a :: b :: r)) : a < b := h.1

/-- **`sortedAsc_head_lt_mem`.** In a strict-ascending list `a :: xs`, the head is strictly
below EVERY element of `xs` (so the head is the unique minimum). The key monotonicity fact. -/
theorem sortedAsc_head_lt_mem {a : Int} {xs : List Int} (h : SortedAsc (a :: xs)) :
    ∀ y ∈ xs, a < y := by
  induction xs generalizing a with
  | nil => intro y hy; exact absurd hy (by simp)

    rcases List.mem_cons.mp hy with hyb | hyr
    · subst hyb; exact hab
    · exact lt_trans hab (ih (sortedAsc_tail h) y hyr)

/-- **`NeighborGap nf xs`** — the structured sorted-neighbor non-membership witness for `nf` against
the committed sorted set `xs`. The clean three-constructor walk a prover follows (the genuine `(lo, hi)`
neighbors are READ OFF the witness by `gapEndpoints`, §4):

* `emptySet` — `xs = []`: the set is empty, so `nf` trivially sits in a vacuous gap (`±∞` neighbors).
* `below`    — `nf` is strictly below the head of `xs` (so, the set being ascending, below everything
  remaining): `xs = hi :: r` and `nf < hi`. The upper neighbor is the head `hi`.
* `skip`     — `nf` is strictly above the head `a` of `xs`, so the search continues past `a` (which
  becomes the new lower-neighbor candidate): `a < nf` and `NeighborGap nf r`.

It is DATA (`Type`, not `Prop`) — `gapEndpoints` extracts the genuine `(lo, hi)` empty-gap endpoints from
its structure (a `Prop` could not be eliminated into `Int × Int`). The argument is SOUND
(`neighborGap_sound`: a witness ⇒ `nf ∉ xs`) and COMPLETE (`neighborGap_complete`: every non-member of a
sorted set has one); `gapEndpoints`/`neighborGap_gives_gap` (§4) read the genuine empty-gap interval off
it for the circuit bridge. -/
inductive NeighborGap (nf : Int) : List Int → Type
  /-- The committed set is empty ⇒ `nf` is (vacuously) a non-member (lower nbr `-∞`, upper `+∞`). -/
  | emptySet : NeighborGap nf []
  /-- `nf` strictly below the head ⇒ below the whole (ascending) set: `xs = hi :: r`, `nf < hi`. The
  upper neighbor is the head `hi`; the lower is whatever predecessor the search carried (or `-∞`). (Named
  `belowHd` — `below` would collide with the auto-generated `NeighborGap.below` recursor helper that the
  structural recursion of `gapEndpointsAux` emits.) -/
  | belowHd {hi : Int} {r : List Int} (h : nf < hi) : NeighborGap nf (hi :: r)
  /-- `nf` strictly above the head `a` ⇒ the search continues past `a` (which becomes the new lower
  neighbor candidate): `a < nf` and `NeighborGap nf r`. -/
  | skip {a : Int} {r : List Int} (h : a < nf) (rest : NeighborGap nf r) : NeighborGap nf (a :: r)

/-- **`neighborGap_sound` (the sorted-neighbor argument is SOUND).** A `NeighborGap` witness
for `nf` against a strict-ascending `xs` proves `nf ∉ xs`: at each step `nf` is either strictly below
the head (so below everything remaining) or strictly above it (so `≠` head, recurse on the sorted tail).
A prover that walks the neighbors has proved non-membership. -/
theorem neighborGap_sound {nf : Int} {xs : List Int} (hs : SortedAsc xs) (hg : NeighborGap nf xs) :
    nf ∉ xs := by
  induction hg with
  | emptySet => simp
  | @belowHd hi r h =>
    -- nf < hi ≤ everything in hi::r ⇒ nf below all ⇒ not a member.
    intro hmem
    rcases List.mem_cons.mp hmem with hh | hr

    · exact absurd (sortedAsc_head_lt_mem hs _ hr) (not_lt.mpr (le_of_lt h))

    rcases List.mem_cons.mp hmem with hh | hr
    · subst hh; exact lt_irrefl _ h
    · exact ih (sortedAsc_tail hs) hr

/-- **`neighborGap_complete` (the sorted-neighbor argument is COMPLETE).** For ANY
strict-ascending committed set `xs`, a genuine non-member `nf ∉ xs` HAS a `NeighborGap` witness — the
honest prover always finds its neighbors. The induction marches the head pointer forward (`skip`) until
`nf` falls below the current head (`below`), or runs off the end (`emptySet`). No non-member is left
un-provable. (A `def`, not a `theorem`: it BUILDS the `Type`-valued witness data.) -/
def neighborGap_complete {nf : Int} {xs : List Int} (hs : SortedAsc xs) (hnm : nf ∉ xs) :

      exact NeighborGap.skip hgt (ih (sortedAsc_tail hs) hnr)

/-- **`neighborGap_iff_not_mem` (the sorted-neighbor argument DECIDES non-membership).** Over a
strict-ascending committed set, a `NeighborGap` witness EXISTS iff `nf ∉ xs`: soundness
(`neighborGap_sound`) gives ⇒, completeness (`neighborGap_complete`) gives ⇐. So "the prover can exhibit
sorted neighbors" is EXACTLY "the nullifier is fresh" — the protocol-side statement the circuit gate is
proved equivalent to in §5. -/
theorem neighborGap_iff_not_mem {nf : Int} {xs : List Int} (hs : SortedAsc xs) :
    Nonempty (NeighborGap nf xs) ↔ nf ∉ xs :=
  ⟨fun ⟨g⟩ => neighborGap_sound hs g, fun hnm => ⟨neighborGap_complete hs hnm⟩⟩

/-! ## §3 — THE CIRCUIT GATE: a real `VmGate` enforcing `lo < nf < hi` with non-negative gap witnesses.

The arithmetic content of the sorted-neighbor argument is the STRICT-BETWEEN check `lo < nf < hi`.
Over `ℤ` (the EffectVM column field model), a strict inequality `a < b` is enforced by a NON-NEGATIVE
gap witness `d` (range-checked `d ≥ 0`) with the linear gate `b − a − 1 − d = 0` (i.e. `b = a + 1 +
d`). Two such gates — `nf = lo + 1 + dLo` and `hi = nf + 1 + dHi` — enforce `lo < nf < hi`. These are
genuine PLONK linear gates (the `affineEq` family Policy.lean cites), with NON-ZERO coefficients on
the neighbor/witness columns — a real constraint, not a vacuous `0 = 0`. The range checks `dLo, dHi ≥
0` are the lookup leg (the meaning; LogUp is how the prover enforces it). -/

/-- Column layout the non-membership gate reads: the spent nullifier `nf`, the two neighbor
read-outs `lo`/`hi`, and the two non-negative gap witnesses `dLo`/`dHi` (the strict-`<` certificates).
Distinct column indices so a row carries all five independently. -/

circuit-arithmetic enforcement: a gate-satisfying row with valid (non-negative) gap witnesses PROVES
`nf` is interior to `(lo, hi)` — a real strict-between constraint, the direction non-membership
soundness rests on. (The converse — completeness — is `nonMemberGate_complete`: the honest prover lays
the EXACT gaps, so an interior `nf` is gate-acceptable. We separate the two because the
witness columns are the prover's: soundness must hold for ANY non-negative witnesses, completeness
EXHIBITS the honest ones.) -/

/-! ## §4 — THE GAP-INTERVAL CHARACTERIZATION: the honest, sentinel-free `(lo, hi)`-neighbor decoding.

To bridge the gate's `lo < nf < hi` to the protocol's `nf ∉ xs`, we need the honest fact that the
row's neighbor read-outs `(lo, hi)` are GENUINE consecutive neighbors of the committed set — i.e. the
open interval `(lo, hi)` contains NO committed element. That is the sentinel-free characterization of
"adjacent in the sorted set" (`lo`/`hi` are adjacent committed values, OR the `±∞` sentinels), and it
is EXACTLY what a sorted-tree adjacency opening certifies. We name it `GapInterval` (the honest

upper neighbor is the head `hi`; at `emptySet` (`nf` ran off the top) the upper neighbor is the `+∞`

### What remains for the FULL deployed noteSpend descriptor (reported)

This module supplies the missing non-membership GATE-KIND with real teeth on both sides. What the
DEPLOYED `noteSpendVmDescriptor`/`noteSpendVmDescriptorFull` (`EffectVmEmitNoteSpend.lean`) still needs
to use it end-to-end:

1. **The sorted-tree adjacency OPENING.** The `(lo, hi)` columns the gate reads are the PROVER's; the
   `GapInterval`/`NmRowEncodes` decoding (that they are GENUINE adjacent committed neighbors) is a
   NAMED hypothesis here, exactly as Policy.lean's `RowEncodesSum` names the field-on-column decoding.
   The deployed descriptor must BIND it: a Merkle/sorted-tree membership opening proving `lo`,`hi` are
   adjacent leaves of the committed `nullifiers` root (and the new `nf` is inserted between them). That
   opening gate-kind is what `noteSpend_freshness_still_needs_nonmembership` flagged the 4-arity
   Poseidon2 hash-site IR lacks. This module builds the FRESHNESS gate that opening feeds; it does not
   build the opening itself.

2. **Wiring the gap columns into the EffectVM layout** (5 new witness columns: `nf`,`lo`,`hi`,`dLo`,
   `dHi`) and the two range checks (`dLo`,`dHi ∈ [0, 2^k)`) as real `RangeSpec`s, plus selector-gating
   the gates to the noteSpend row.

3. **The set-update half** (insert `nf` between `lo` and `hi`, re-root) is the existing
   `gNullifierRootUpdate` accumulator gate (`EffectVmEmitNoteSpend §B`); this freshness gate composes
   BEFORE it (prove `nf` fresh, then commit the insert). The two together = the full deployed
   no-double-spend, once the opening (1) binds the neighbors.

So: the EXECUTOR-side no-double-spend is CLOSED in-band (`noteSpendStmt_no_double_spend`); the
CIRCUIT-side non-membership GATE is built with real teeth (sound + complete + anti-ghost +
`witnessed`-discharge); the remaining gap is the sorted-tree OPENING that binds the gate's neighbor
columns to the committed root — named precisely.
-/

The §1–§8 content built the EXECUTOR-side no-double-spend (in-band in the term) + the genuine SORTED-

In a parallel lift, the per-row RUNNABLE EffectVM descriptor for noteSpend (the circuit the prover
ACTUALLY RUNS, `EffectVmEmitNoteSpend §W`) has been raised to the GENERIC full-state-on-RUNNABLE crown:
a satisfying witness of the WIDE descriptor (the dedicated `sysRootsDigestCol = 186` carrier +
`wideHashSites`) pins the FULL 17-field post-state — the per-cell transparent credit + nonce tick AND the
`nullifiers`-root committed-digest advance AND every other side-table root frozen — and tamper of ANY
field/root is UNSAT. We re-export the crown here so the Argus noteSpend module names the RUNNABLE
descriptor's full-state property alongside the non-membership gate; the headline FRESHNESS leg this
file's §2–§5 gate supplies is the still-named non-per-row residual (the digest advance binds the INSERT,
not the non-membership). -/

/-- **`noteSpend_runnable_full_sound_argus` — the RUNNABLE EffectVM descriptor binds the FULL state.**
Re-export of `EffectVmEmitNoteSpend.noteSpend_runnable_full_sound`: a row satisfying noteSpend's WIDE
RUNNABLE descriptor, under the structured decode, pins the FULL 17-field declarative post-state — the
per-cell credit + nonce tick AND the `nullifiers`-root digest advance AND every other side-table root
frozen. This is the per-row layer at FULL state; the FRESHNESS non-membership (this file's §2–§5 gate)
remains the named turn-level leg. -/
