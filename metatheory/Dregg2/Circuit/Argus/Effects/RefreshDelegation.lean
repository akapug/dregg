# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.RefreshDelegation — the DELEGATION-SNAPSHOT effect `refreshDelegationA`
welded into the Argus IR, on the FULL-STATE `Surface2` surface.

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone (the executor IS the meaning of a `RecStmt` term) and validated it
on transfer/mint/burn (single-cell moves). `Argus/Effects/BalanceA.lean` is the FULL-STATE template: it
welds a v2 `EffectCommit2`/`Surface2` `*_full_sound` (concluding the WHOLE post-state) by routing the
executor side through a chained-executor lift + an independent executor⟺spec corner. This module replays
THAT (stronger) template for the different **cap-graph / delegation-snapshot** effect
`refreshDelegationA`, in a disjoint file (it imports the Argus IR + the audited `refreshDelegationA` v2
instance read-only and owns only its own declarations; it edits no other Argus module).

## What `refreshDelegationA` does (the kernel step the cornerstone pins)

`refreshDelegationA` is the SELF-only delegation refresh (dregg1 `apply_refresh_delegation`,
`apply.rs:2991`): a child re-snapshots its parent's CURRENT c-list. The chained kernel arm is
`refreshDelegationChainA` (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:1761`), which `execFullA` routes to
(`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3897`). FAIL-CLOSED on a TWO-conjunct gate — the self-authority gate
(`stateAuthB actor child`, dregg1's self-only `action_target == child`) AND the child having a
parent (`(delegate child).isSome`, dregg1's `delegate.ok_or_else`, `apply.rs:3004`). On commit it
OVERWRITES `delegations child` with a FRESH snapshot of the parent's CURRENT `caps` (`parentClist`),
prepends a self-targeted receipt row, and FREEZES the other 16 `RecordKernelState` fields. Balance-neutral.

Because it touches the per-cell `delegations : CellId → List Cap` registry (NOT `cell`/`bal`/`caps`), the
IR body's move is the §A `setDelegations` write-primitive (`Stmt.lean:71`) — the FIRST weld to use it. The
gate is a bare guard over those two conjuncts. Unlike `BalanceA` (whose chained executor adds a 7th
`acceptsEffects` dst-liveness conjunct ON TOP of the raw kernel gate), the refresh CHAINED gate is
IDENTICAL to the kernel-step gate (`refreshDelegationChainA` has no `acceptsEffects` pre-gate) — so the
chained lift carries NO extra side-condition (a cleaner lift than BalanceA's).

## THE DESCRIPTOR (the full-state crown jewel — read this)

`refreshDelegationA` carries a GENUINE standalone full-state circuit⟺spec descriptor in the v2
EffectCommit2 / `Surface2` universe (`Dregg2/Circuit/Inst/refreshDelegationA.lean`):

  * `refreshDelegationE D hD` — the `EffectSpec2` whose touched component is the WHOLE `delegations`
    FUNCTION, digested by a `funcComponent` (`D : (CellId → List Cap) → ℤ`, `Function.Injective D`); its
    `restFrame` freezes the other 16 kernel fields and its `logUpdate` is the receipt prepend.
  * `refreshDelegationA_full_sound : satisfiedE2 S (refreshDelegationE D hD) (encodeE2 …) ⟹
    RefreshDelegationSpec` — a FULL 17-field declarative post-state soundness (`Spec/refreshdelegation.lean`),
    keyed on the chained executor via the independent `refreshDelegation_iff_spec` (executor ⟺ spec, BOTH
    directions, full state).

This module covers both directions, exactly as BalanceA:

  (1) **Cornerstone (the standalone executor-refinement):** `interp_refreshDelegationStmt_eq_refreshDelegationStep`
      — the kernel step IS the Argus term, using `setDelegations`. New, standalone, the delegation-snapshot
      analog of `interp_balanceAStmt_eq_recKExecAsset`.

  (2) **Compile weld against refreshDelegationA's OWN full-state descriptor:** lift the kernel cornerstone
      to the chained `execFullA` (NO side-condition — the gate is identical), then weld to
      `refreshDelegationA_full_sound`. The conclusion is the FULL `RefreshDelegationSpec` agreement (all 17
      kernel fields + the receipt log) — a satisfying witness of refresh's own circuit agrees with the WHOLE
      post-state the IR term's executor produces. The FULL-STATE Surface2 surface (strictly stronger than a
      per-cell EffectVM projection).

## SURFACE + THE REPORTED KERNEL-vs-RUNTIME DIVERGENCE (precise — do NOT over-read)

  * **FULL-STATE Surface2 (not per-cell).** The conclusion is `st' = { kernel := k', log := receipt :: log }`
    — the WHOLE chained post-state, because `RefreshDelegationSpec` pins every one of the 17 kernel fields
    plus the log. This is the same surface BalanceA's `balanceA_compile_sound` reaches, on the delegation
    registry. The descriptor digests the `delegations` FUNCTION (a `funcComponent` whole-function digest);
    so the circuit binds the function up to `D`'s injectivity, the faithful digest-not-list boundary.

  * **THE DIGEST BOUNDARY.** The circuit carries the `delegations` post-state as a SCALAR `funcComponent`
    digest `D (refreshDelegationsMap …)`, not the function literally. The full-state agreement holds because
    BOTH the circuit-side soundness AND the executor-side `refreshDelegation_iff_spec` name the SAME
    `RefreshDelegationSpec`, whose `delegations` clause IS the function equality; the realizability of `D`
    (`Function.Injective D`) enters ONLY inside the reused `refreshDelegationA_full_sound`, not in the welded
    conclusion's statement.

  * **THE REPORTED DIVERGENCE — kernel step vs full Rust RUNTIME (the `delegation_epoch` root-gap).** The
    Rust runtime's `RefreshDelegation` action also bumps a `delegation_epoch` counter (a freshness witness
    the runtime tracks); the Lean kernel step models the SNAPSHOT overwrite but NOT an epoch counter
    (`RecordKernelState` has no `delegation_epoch` field). So on the epoch witness the Lean kernel step is a
    STRICT UNDER-MODEL of the Rust runtime — the same flagged cap-revocation/refresh root-gap as the sibling
    `RevokeDelegation` weld. This is reported, not papered, as `refreshKernel_undermodels_runtime_epoch` (a
    documentation theorem pinning the model carries no epoch field — the `delegate` parent pointer is frozen,
    so no monotone epoch is tracked), so the gap cannot silently regress. Closing it is a kernel-model
    widening (add a `delegationEpoch` registry to the kernel + re-derive the descriptor), out of scope.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on every headline theorem ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; the
whole-function-digest assumption enters ONLY inside the reused `refreshDelegationA_full_sound` (its
`Function.Injective D` hypothesis), not in the welded conclusion's statement. No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no
`native_decide`. Imports are read-only; this file owns only itself.

The kernel step `refreshDelegationStep k ⟨actor, child⟩` (`Handlers/Lifecycle.lean:67`) is
`if stateAuthB k.caps actor child && (k.delegate child).isSome then some { k with delegations := … } else
none`, where the post-`delegations` is `fun c => if c = child then parentClist k child else k.delegations c`
— EXACTLY the declarative `refreshDelegationsMap k child` (`Spec/refreshdelegation.lean:30`). We capture
it term-for-term: a `Bool` `guard` of the EXACT two conjuncts, then a `setDelegations` whose leaf is
`refreshDelegationsMap`. The contrast with transfer/mint/burn is the move primitive: `setDelegations`
(rewrites the per-cell `delegations` registry) over `refreshDelegationsMap` (the self-targeted parent
snapshot), NOT `setCell`/`recTransfer`. -/

/-- The refreshDelegation admissibility gate as a `Bool` — exactly `refreshDelegationStep`'s `if` (the two
conjuncts: self-authority over `child`, and `child` having a parent). The kernel gate is

/-- **The refreshDelegation effect as an IR term: gate, then snapshot the parent c-list.** Mirrors
`transferStmt` (gate, then move) but the move is `setDelegations` over `refreshDelegationsMap` — the

`setCell` over `recTransfer`. The `setDelegations` leaf is `refreshDelegationsMap k child`, EXACTLY the
post-`delegations` `refreshDelegationStep` installs. -/

`refreshDelegationStep`. -/

/-! ## §3 — Lifting the cornerstone to the CHAINED executor `refreshDelegationChainA` / `execFullA`.

The standalone refreshDelegation descriptor (§4) is keyed on the CHAINED executor `execFullA` over
`RecChainedState` (kernel + receipt log) — the arm `execFullA s (.refreshDelegationA actor child) =
refreshDelegationChainA s actor child` (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3897`). The §2 cornerstone is over the
kernel step `refreshDelegationStep`. The chained layer is exactly `refreshDelegationStep` on the kernel
PLUS the receipt-log prepend `receipt :: s.log` — and, crucially, the SAME two-conjunct gate (no extra
`acceptsEffects` pre-gate, unlike BalanceA). We bridge faithfully, carrying NO side-condition: when the §2
cornerstone commits on the kernel, the chained executor commits with the receipt prepended. -/

/-- **`interp_refreshDelegationStmt_chained` — the IR term's executor, lifted to the chained `execFullA`.**
When the §2 cornerstone commits on the kernel (`interp (refreshDelegationStmt actor child) st.kernel =
some k'`), the unified action executor `execFullA st (.refreshDelegationA actor child)` commits to the
chained state `⟨k', refreshDelegationReceipt actor child :: st.log⟩`. So the Argus term's kernel meaning
lifts to the chained executor the standalone descriptor speaks about — with NO carried side-condition (the
chained gate IS the kernel gate). -/

/-! ## §4 — THE COMPILE WELD: a satisfying witness of refreshDelegation's OWN standalone full-state circuit
agrees with the FULL post-state the IR term's executor interpretation produces.

This welds against refreshDelegation's GENUINE standalone descriptor `refreshDelegationE D hD` (the v2
`Surface2` circuit whose soundness is `refreshDelegationA_full_sound`), exactly as `BalanceA` welds against
`balanceAE`/`balanceA_full_sound`. The executor side is routed through §3 (`interp` ⟹ `execFullA`) and the
independent `refreshDelegation_iff_spec` (executor ⟺ `RefreshDelegationSpec`); the circuit side is the
audited `refreshDelegationA_full_sound` (circuit ⟹ `RefreshDelegationSpec`). Both name the SAME
`RefreshDelegationSpec`, so they PROVABLY agree on the WHOLE 17-field state + the log — a full-state weld. -/

here so this module imports only `Inst.refreshDelegationA`). Its soundness `refreshDelegationA_full_sound`

/-- **`refreshDelegationSpec_unique` — the spec pins a UNIQUE post-state.** Two chained states that BOTH

reconstructs the SAME committed value `execFullA st (.refreshDelegationA actor child) = some ·`, and `some`
is injective. This is exactly the sense in which `RefreshDelegationSpec` is functional — it determines the

    `refreshDelegationE`'s full-state v2 arithmetization satisfied on the encoded triple) holds, under the
    realizable whole-function digest portals (`hRest : RestIffNoDelegations S.RH`, `hLog :

  * the IR term's EXECUTOR interpretation COMMITS on the kernel:
    `interp (refreshDelegationStmt actor child) st.kernel = some k'` (`hexec`).

Then the chained post-state the circuit pins is EXACTLY the chained post-state the IR term's executor
produces: `st' = { kernel := k', log := refreshDelegationReceipt actor child :: st.log }`. I.e.
refreshDelegation's OWN circuit and the IR term AGREE on the WHOLE 17-field RecordKernelState (`delegations
child` overwritten with the parent snapshot, every other field frozen) AND the receipt log — the full

if the gate admitted everything. A concrete kernel `kRD` (child `1` has parent `0`, parent holds a

/-! ### §5.1 — THE REPORTED DIVERGENCE: the Lean kernel step UNDER-MODELS the Rust runtime's
`delegation_epoch` bump (the memory-flagged cap-refresh root-gap).

The full Rust runtime's `RefreshDelegation` does TWO things: (1) overwrite the child's `delegations`
snapshot with the parent's current c-list, AND (2) bump a `delegation_epoch` freshness counter. The Lean
kernel step `refreshDelegationStep` models ONLY (1). There is no `delegation_epoch` field on
`RecordKernelState` at all; the per-cell `delegate` (parent pointer) registry — the natural place a
monotone epoch witness would hang — is LEFT UNTOUCHED (frozen in `RefreshDelegationSpec`).

We pin (1) ⟹ (delegate frozen) as a DOCUMENTATION THEOREM so the under-model cannot silently regress: a
committed kernel refresh FREEZES `delegate` (the registry a faithful (2) would key its epoch off). This
makes the divergence a checked fact of the model, not a buried assumption. Closing it is a kernel-model
WIDENING (add a `delegationEpoch` registry + bump to `refreshDelegationStep`, then re-derive the
descriptor), explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this weld. -/

/-- **`refreshKernel_undermodels_runtime_epoch` — the reported divergence, as a checked theorem.** A
committed kernel refresh FREEZES the per-cell `delegate` parent-pointer registry (it edits ONLY the
`delegations` snapshot): there is no `delegation_epoch` field on `RecordKernelState`, so the runtime's
freshness-counter bump is NOT modeled. This pins `delegate` frozen on commit, so the under-model is a
checked fact, not a buried assumption. -/

/-- **`refreshKernel_freezes_delegate` — the under-model is OBSERVABLE (concrete witness).** After a
committed refresh of child `1` on `kRD`, the `delegate` parent pointer of `1` is STILL `some 0` (unchanged)

kernel post-state carries NO epoch witness the runtime would have bumped. The divergence is real, not a
labeling artifact. -/
