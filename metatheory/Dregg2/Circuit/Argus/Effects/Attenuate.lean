# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.Attenuate — the capability ATTENUATE effect welded into the Argus IR,
in its OWN disjoint module (the per-effect-farm vehicle, off the Argus cornerstone). THE CROWN weld:
attenuate is where capability NON-AMPLIFICATION (`granted.rights ≤ held.rights`) must be enforced.

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone (`interp (transferStmt …) = recKExec`): the executor IS the
meaning of the IR term, by construction. It also built `checkSubset (a b : RecordKernelState → ExecAuth)`,
the FINITE-LATTICE gate — a pure domain-restrictor that commits IFF `a k ⊆ b k` over the genuine
`ExecAuth = Finset Auth` order (the FULL in-band realization of non-amplification, superseding the
cardinality-only `checkLe (… → Int)`). This module welds the cap-graph ATTENUATE effect onto an Argus
term that INTERNALIZES the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` non-amplification in-band via `checkSubset`,
and binds it against the audited GENUINE class-A cap-root descriptor.

## The executor target — the kernel ATTENUATE step (faithful, named, not re-invented)

The running kernel-level attenuate step is `attenuateStep` (`Exec/Handlers/Authority.lean:247`):

    attenuateStep k a = some { k with caps := attenuateSlotF k.caps a.actor a.idx a.keep }

i.e. it narrows the actor's OWN `idx`-th held cap to `keep` IN PLACE (`attenuateSlotF`), edits ONLY
`caps`, and ALWAYS commits (attenuation cannot fail — at worst the identity, still narrower-or-equal).
This is the SAME `attenuateSlotF s.kernel.caps args.actor args.idx args.keep` post cap-table the genuine
descriptor's `unify_attenuate` already targets (`EffectVmEmitAttenuateA §8`). The narrowing primitive is
`attenuate keep c` (`Exec/Caps.lean:79`): for an `endpoint t rights` cap it FILTERS `rights` to those in
`keep`; a `node`/`null` cap is unchanged. So the conferred-rights of the result are a genuine SUBLIST
(hence ⊆) of the parent's (`attenuate_subset`) — the real `is_attenuation`, NOT a `()≤()` collapse.

## ⚑ THE RIGHTS-LATTICE FINDING — RESOLVED (`checkSubset`, the finite-lattice primitive, now in the IR)

The non-amplification order is `confRights granted ≤ confRights held` over `ExecAuth := Finset Auth`
ordered by `⊆` (`Exec/Caps.lean:57-66`), a SUBSET relation over the 7-atom powerset of
`Auth = {read,write,grant,call,reply,reset,control}` (`Authority/Positional.lean:37`). This is a PARTIAL
order: `{read}` and `{write}` are INCOMPARABLE. The PRIOR weld gated on `checkLe (a b : … → Int)`, which
compares two SCALAR `Int` read-outs with the TOTAL order `a k ≤ b k` — and there is NO order-embedding of
`(Finset Auth, ⊆)` into `(Int, ≤)`: any bitmask encoding makes `Int ≤` DISAGREE with `⊆` (e.g. `{write}` =
bit 2² = 2 and `{read}` = bit 2⁰ = 1 give `1 ≤ 2`, yet `{read} ⊄ {write}`). So `checkLe` could carry only
the rights-CARDINALITY shadow (`granted ⊆ held ⟹ |granted| ≤ |held|`), NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for
the subset (`checkLe_card_necessary_not_sufficient`, retained below: two equal-cardinality rights sets can
be non-subset / incomparable). **RESOLUTION: `Argus/Stmt.lean` now provides `RecStmt.checkSubset (a b :
RecordKernelState → ExecAuth)` — the domain-restrictor over the genuine `Finset Auth` `⊆` (= `≤`) order
(`Auth` has `DecidableEq`, so the gate is computable). This module's `attenuateStmt` GATES ON IT: the term
is `seq (checkSubset (granted.rights) (held.rights)) (setCaps …)`, so the FULL `granted.rights ⊆
held.rights` non-amplification is now enforced IN-BAND — rejecting BOTH a strict superset AND an
incomparable pair (`checkSubset_rejects_overbroad_grant` / `checkSubset_rejects_incomparable_grant`, §6).
The cardinality gap is closed.**

## HOW NON-AMPLIFICATION IS WITNESSED IN-BAND — the three legs, stated precisely (leg 1 now FULL subset)

  1. **`checkSubset` in the term (in-band, executor-side, FULL subset):** the term is
     `seq (checkSubset (granted.rights) (held.rights)) (setCaps <install attenuated slot>)`. The
     `checkSubset` gate is the in-band non-amplification check over the GENUINE rights lattice: it admits
     IFF the installed cap's conferred-rights SET is `⊆` the parent's. It REJECTS a superset AND an
     incomparable pair, proven two-valued below — the FULL order, not the cardinality shadow.
  2. **the descriptor binds WHICH rights were installed (circuit-side):** `attenuateGenuine_sound` forces
     `post.capRoot = hash[ hash[holder,target,RIGHTS,op], pre.capRoot ]` — the GENUINE in-row cap-root
     recompute (NOT an opaque parameter), and `attenuateGenuine_binds_edge` anti-ghosts the `RIGHTS`
     param (and holder/target/op + old root) through the published `state_commit`: a tampered installed
     `RIGHTS` digest MOVES `cap_root`, MOVES `state_commit` ⇒ UNSAT. So the circuit PINS which rights
     digest landed in the cap table.
  3. **the executor STRUCTURALLY attenuates (the full subset):** `attenuate keep c` filters the rights,
     so `confRights (attenuate keep c) ≤ confRights c` over the genuine `Finset Auth ⊆` order
     (`attenuate_subset` / `attenuate_confRights_le`) — the FULL subset, which is exactly why the in-band
     `checkSubset` gate (leg 1) admits on every genuine attenuation (`grantedRightsSet_le_held`).

Together: the descriptor pins WHICH rights digest was installed (leg 2); the in-term `checkSubset` proves
the installed rights SET is `⊆` the parent's IN-BAND, the FULL order (leg 1); and the executor's
`attenuate` structurally produces that same subset (leg 3). Leg 1 and leg 3 now state the SAME full
subset — the prior cardinality/subset gap is closed.

## SURFACE — exactly the cap-family per-cell weld surface (do NOT over-read)

The circuit side is the audited CLASS-A genuine descriptor `attenuateVmDescriptorGenuine` +
`attenuateGenuine_sound` (`EffectVmEmitAttenuateA §G`). The weld concludes the SAME per-cell surface the
cap family lives on: a SINGLE-ROW AIR whose `CapCellSpecGenuine` pins ONE cell's transition — the
`cap_root` GENUINELY RECOMPUTED `hash[edge_leaf, pre.capRoot]` (FORCED, not opaque), every other column
(balance limbs / nonce / 8 fields / reserved) FROZEN — bound into the published `state_commit`. What it
does NOT claim: it does NOT assert the circuit row's cap-table FUNCTION equals the executor's
`attenuateSlotF …` as a whole `Caps` function (the EffectVM row carries the `cap_root` DIGEST, not the
function — they agree only up to the cap-root, the `cap_root` connector); the executor produces the real
`Caps` function (the cornerstone), the circuit produces the genuine recompute of its digest. That
digest-not-function boundary is faithful, stated, not hidden — the SAME boundary the cap-graph keystone
carries. Cross-row composition is the turn layer (`TurnEmit`), cited not claimed.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on both welds ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY via
the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis (inside the cited anti-ghost `attenuateGenuine_binds_edge`, not
the welds here). No `rfl`-posing-as-bridge. Non-vacuity:
`checkSubset` REJECTS an over-broad grant (rights SET ⊄ parent ⇒ `none`) AND an INCOMPARABLE pair (the
gain over `checkLe`), and ADMITS a genuine attenuation; the genuine descriptor is the non-trivial class-A
circuit, not the placeholder. This module OWNS only itself; every import is read-only.

/-! ## §0 — the rights-CARDINALITY read-outs (the in-band SCALAR shadow of non-amplification).

`checkLe` restricts on `Int ≤`, so the in-band non-amplification gate reads two `Int` scalars: the
rights-COUNT of the parent (held) cap and of the attenuated (granted) cap, both read off the kernel
state. `heldCapAt actor idx k` is the actor's `idx`-th held cap (the slot `attenuateSlotF` narrows); the
two read-outs are the conferred-rights LENGTHs of that cap and of its `keep`-attenuation. -/

/-- The actor's `idx`-th held cap on kernel state `k` (the slot `attenuateSlotF` narrows in place); the
parent cap whose authority the attenuation must not exceed. `Cap.null` when the slot is absent (a
`null` cap confers no rights — the safe floor). -/

/-- **`grantedRightsCard_le_held` — the in-band gate ALWAYS admits a genuine attenuation.**
The attenuated cap's conferred-rights COUNT is `≤` the parent's, for EVERY cap shape: the `endpoint`
filter shrinks the rights list (`List.length_filter_le`); `node`/`null` caps are unchanged. So the
`checkLe` non-amplification gate (granted-count ≤ held-count) commits on every genuine attenuate — it is
fail-closed, never fail-stuck. (The genuine *subset* is the stronger `attenuate_subset`; this is its
cardinality shadow, the scalar `checkLe` can carry.) -/

/-! ### §0′ — the FULL rights-SET read-outs (the genuine `Finset Auth` non-amplification carrier).

The cardinality read-outs above are the SCALAR shadow `checkLe` carries; the FULL non-amplification gate
reads the genuine rights LATTICE element `confRights c = (capAuthConferred c).toFinset : ExecAuth`
(`Exec/Caps.lean:66`), ordered by `⊆`. These two read-outs are the conferred-rights SETS of the held
(parent) cap and of its `keep`-attenuation — the values the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` gate
(`checkSubset`) compares. -/

The authority the attenuation must not exceed, now in its genuine `⊆`-ordered carrier (not a scalar). -/

def grantedRightsSet (actor : CellId) (idx : Nat) (keep : List Auth) : RecordKernelState → ExecAuth :=
  fun k => confRights (attenuate keep (heldCapAt actor idx k))

/-- **`grantedRightsSet_le_held` — the FULL in-band gate ALWAYS admits a genuine attenuation.**
The attenuated cap's conferred-rights SET is `⊆` (= `≤`) the parent's, over the genuine `ExecAuth =
Finset Auth` order — directly `attenuate_confRights_le` (the executor's `attenuate` STRUCTURALLY narrows,
`attenuate_subset` lifted to `Finset`). So the `checkSubset` non-amplification gate (granted ⊆ held)
commits on every genuine attenuate: fail-closed, never fail-stuck. This is the FULL subset, NOT the
cardinality shadow `grantedRightsCard_le_held` carries — the gain the `checkSubset` upgrade buys. -/

/-! ## §1 — THE IR TERM: the in-band FULL-SUBSET non-amplification `checkSubset` gate, then the install.

`attenuateStmt = seq (checkSubset (granted.rights) (held.rights)) (setCaps <attenuateSlotF install>)`.
The leading `checkSubset` is the in-band non-amplification gate over the GENUINE rights lattice
(`ExecAuth = Finset Auth`, ordered by `⊆`): the installed cap's conferred-rights SET must be `⊆` the
parent's. This is the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` rule INTERNALIZED in the term — not merely its
cardinality shadow (the `checkLe` of the prior weld, which `checkLe_card_necessary_not_sufficient`
showed could not reject an incomparable pair). The `setCaps` is the EXACT executor cap-table write
(`attenuateSlotF k.caps actor idx keep`). This is the whole point of the crown weld: the FULL
non-amplification order is now an in-band IR gate. -/

/-- **The attenuate effect as an Argus IR term (FULL in-band non-amplification).** Gate on the genuine
subset check `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` over `ExecAuth = Finset Auth` (via `checkSubset`), then
install the in-place narrowed actor slot (`attenuateSlotF` — the EXACT executor cap-table write). The
`checkSubset` leg is the in-band realization of the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` partial order
(rejecting BOTH a superset AND an incomparable pair — the thing the prior `checkLe` cardinality gate
could not); the `setCaps` leg is the verified executor move. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE CORNERSTONE: `interp` of the attenuate term IS the kernel ATTENUATE step.

The SAME shape as the transfer/escrow cornerstones, with the leading gate being the `checkSubset` FULL
non-amplification domain-restrictor instead of a `guard`. Because a genuine attenuation NEVER amplifies —
the executor's `attenuate` STRUCTURALLY produces a subset (`grantedRightsSet_le_held`, i.e.
`attenuate_confRights_le`) — the `checkSubset` gate ALWAYS fires (`some k`), so the `bind` runs the
`setCaps` install — which is exactly `attenuateStep`'s `some { k with caps := attenuateSlotF … }`. The
executor IS the meaning of the term, INCLUDING that the in-term FULL-subset `checkSubset` gate matches
the executor's (always-admitting) attenuation discipline. The full subset is now enforced IN-BAND. -/

/-- **The cornerstone (crown).** `interp` of the attenuate term IS the kernel ATTENUATE step
`attenuateStep` — the same partial function, by construction, exactly as the transfer/mint/burn/escrow
cornerstones. The in-term FULL `checkSubset` non-amplification gate is shown to MATCH the executor: it
admits on every genuine attenuation (`grantedRightsSet_le_held` — the genuine `granted.rights ⊆
held.rights`, via `attenuate_subset`/`attenuate_confRights_le`), so the term commits exactly when
(always) `attenuateStep` does, installing the SAME `attenuateSlotF` cap table. -/

/-! ## §3 — the `checkSubset` non-amplification gate is GENUINELY TWO-VALUED over the FULL subset order
(the in-band tooth, now closing the cardinality gap).

The gate is worthless if it admitted everything. It does not: `checkSubset` REJECTS (fails closed) any
move whose installed cap's rights SET is NOT `⊆` the parent's (`checkSubset_admits_iff`, the §L′
keystone) — and crucially that rejection covers an INCOMPARABLE pair, not just a strict superset. This is
the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights` enforced in-band, closing the gap the prior `checkLe` cardinality
gate left open (`checkLe_card_necessary_not_sufficient`, retained below as the precise record of WHY the
upgrade was needed). -/

/-- **`attenuateStmt_admits_iff` — the in-band gate is exactly the FULL non-amplification SUBSET check.**
The attenuate term COMMITS (its `checkSubset` leg admits) IFF the installed cap's conferred-rights SET is
`⊆` the parent's, over the genuine `ExecAuth = Finset Auth` order. So the in-band gate REJECTS
(fails closed) a move that is NOT a subset — a strict superset OR an incomparable pair: two-valued,
non-vacuous, and the FULL partial order (not the cardinality shadow). -/

/-! ## §5 — THE WELD: a satisfying witness of the GENUINE descriptor agrees, per cell, with the
post-state the IR term's executor interpretation produces — AND recomputes the bound cap edge.

Unlike `Argus/Compile.lean` (which routes through the central `compileE`), this module welds DIRECTLY
against the audited class-A `attenuateVmDescriptorGenuine` (the genuine cap-root recompute). The circuit
side is `attenuateGenuine_sound` (the §G class-A soundness, fed via the §4 bridges); the executor side is
the §2 cornerstone. The non-amplification in-band leg is the §1/§3 `checkLe` carried by the IR term. -/

/-- **`attenuate_compile_sound` — the welded soundness (attenuate slice, the crown).**

Suppose, for the Argus attenuate term `attenuateStmt actor idx keep`:
  * the audited class-A circuit `attenuateVmDescriptorGenuine` is SATISFIED by `(env, true, true)` under
    the abstract Poseidon carrier `hash`, and its `CapRowEncodes` decoding NAMES the `(pre, post)` cell
    states with the post-cap-digest `capDigestNew` (`henc`);
  * the IR term's EXECUTOR interpretation COMMITS: `interp (attenuateStmt actor idx keep) k = some k'`
    (`hexec`) — which, by the §2 cornerstone, IS the kernel step `attenuateStep` installing
    `attenuateSlotF k.caps actor idx keep`.

Then the circuit's pinned post-cell state is the GENUINE `CapCellSpecGenuine`: `post.capRoot` is the
FORCED in-row recompute `hash[ hash[holder,target,rights,op], pre.capRoot ]` (NOT an opaque parameter —
the cap-root is recomputed from the bound cap-edge mutation + the old root), every other column
(balance limbs / nonce / 8 fields / reserved) FROZEN.

PRECISELY (do NOT over-read): the descriptor PINS *which* cap-edge digest (holder/target/RIGHTS/op) landed
in `cap_root` and binds it into `state_commit` (`attenuateGenuine_binds_edge`, cited: a tampered `RIGHTS`
digest moves `cap_root` ⇒ UNSAT) — that is leg 2 of non-amplification. The IN-BAND `checkSubset` of the
term (leg 1) now proves the installed rights SET is `⊆` the parent's — the FULL `granted.rights ⊆
held.rights` order (the cardinality gap of the prior `checkLe` weld is CLOSED in-band); the executor's
`attenuate` (leg 3, `attenuate_subset`/`attenuate_confRights_le`) STRUCTURALLY produces that same subset,
which is exactly why the `checkSubset` gate always admits a genuine attenuation. The descriptor itself
does NOT re-derive the subset order (it binds WHICH rights digest landed); the FULL non-amplification is
supplied by the in-band `checkSubset` gate + the executor's structural attenuation — both now the genuine
subset, not a scalar shadow. The executor produces the real `Caps` FUNCTION; the circuit produces the
genuine recompute of its `cap_root` DIGEST (the digest-not-function boundary, faithful, stated). -/

/-! ## §6 — NON-VACUITY: the genuine descriptor is the real class-A circuit; the in-band `checkSubset`
admits a valid attenuation and REJECTS a non-subset — INCLUDING an incomparable pair.

The weld would be worthless if (a) the descriptor were the inert placeholder, or (b) the in-band gate
admitted everything. Neither: the genuine descriptor carries 12 frame gates + the cap-root recompute (the
opaque `gCapMove` is GONE), and the `checkSubset` gate is two-valued over the FULL subset order (admits a
real narrowing of a 2-rights cap to 1; rejects a synthetic widening AND — the gain over the prior `checkLe`
cardinality gate — rejects an INCOMPARABLE pair). -/

/-- A concrete kernel state: actor `0` holds one `endpoint 9 [read, write]` cap (2 conferred rights), on
the §C two-cell `kC` base. The slot `attenuateSlotF 0 0` narrows. -/
def kAtten : RecordKernelState :=
  { kC with caps := fun l => if l = 0 then [Cap.endpoint 9 [Auth.read, Auth.write]] else [] }

/-- **NON-VACUITY (witness TRUE — the in-band gate ADMITS a genuine attenuation).** Narrowing actor `0`'s
held `[read, write]` cap (rights `{read,write}`) to `[read]` (rights `{read}`) has granted-set `{read} ⊆
{read,write} =` held-set, so the `checkSubset` FULL non-amplification gate COMMITS and the term installs
the narrowed slot (`isSome`). -/

/-- **NON-VACUITY (witness FALSE / the in-band anti-amplification tooth — superset).** A synthetic move
whose installed cap's rights SET is a strict SUPERSET of the parent's (`{read,write} ⊄ {read}`) is
REJECTED by the `checkSubset` gate (`interp = none`) — the in-band FULL non-amplification check fails
closed on amplification. (We exhibit the rejection directly on `checkSubset`, the term's gating leg, with
an explicit over-broad granted-vs-held pair.) -/

  rw [interp_checkSubset]; decide

/-- **⚑ NON-VACUITY (the GAIN over `checkLe` — the in-band gate rejects an INCOMPARABLE pair).** The
thing the prior cardinality `checkLe` could NEVER do (`checkLe_card_necessary_not_sufficient`): a move
granting `{write}` against a parent holding only `{read}` (EQUAL cardinality `1`, but NEITHER a subset of
the other) is REJECTED by `checkSubset` (`interp = none`). This is the FULL `granted.rights ⊆ held.rights`
partial order enforced in-band — the crown upgrade, demonstrated on the actual gating leg of the term. -/

/-- **NON-VACUITY (the descriptor is the genuine class-A circuit, not the placeholder).** The genuine
attenuate descriptor carries 12 frame-freeze gates + 14 transition + 4 boundary = 30 constraints, and 6

So `attenuate_compile_sound` is a statement about a REAL recomputed cap-root circuit. -/

/-! ## §W — THE MAGNESIUM CROWN re-exported for the attenuate weld (FULL 17-field RUNNABLE binding).

The §-genuine descriptor binds the per-cell block. The shared cap-graph WIDE descriptor
(`EffectVmEmitAttenuateA §W`, `attenuateVmDescriptorWide`) lifts the RUNNABLE binding to the FULL
17-field post-state: the per-cell `cap_root` MOVE + frame freeze AND the 8 side-table roots (frozen — a
caps-only effect). `cap_runnable_full_sound` is that crown; `cap_runnable_rejects_root_tamper_or_collides`
/ `cap_runnable_rejects_cap_root_tamper_or_collides` are the whole-state anti-ghost teeth — each concludes
that a tampering pair exhibits a genuine collision of the deployed sponge (`WideColl` on the state block or
`RootsColl` on the ordered root list). Their old forms concluded `False` from `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`,
which the deployed BabyBear sponge REFUTES, so at deployed parameters they were vacuous; the disjunctive
forms are formally weaker and hold of the deployed sponge. We re-export the crown for the attenuate weld so
the magnesium full-state property is visible at this layer. The crown itself never carried the refuted
floor, so it is unchanged. -/

/-- **`attenuate_runnable_full_sound` — the attenuate MAGNESIUM crown (re-exported).** A row satisfying
the wide runnable cap-graph descriptor pins the FULL 17-field post-state. The shared
