# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Effects.BalanceA — the per-asset value-movement effect `balanceA` welded
into the Argus IR.

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone (the executor IS the meaning of a `RecStmt` term) and validated
it on transfer/mint/burn — each a SINGLE-CELL move on the per-cell record `balance` field (`setCell`,
`recKExec`/`recKMint`/`recKBurn`). This module welds the genuinely DIFFERENT ledger primitive `balanceA`,
in a disjoint file (it imports the Argus IR + the audited `balanceA` instance read-only and owns only its
own declarations).

`balanceA` moves the GENUINE per-asset ledger `bal : CellId → AssetId → ℤ` — NOT the record-cell `balance`
field that `transfer` moves. The verified kernel transition is `recKExecAsset` (`RecordKernel.lean:756`):

    recKExecAsset k turn a
      = if authorizedB k.caps turn = true ∧ 0 ≤ turn.amt ∧ turn.amt ≤ k.bal turn.src a
           ∧ turn.src ≠ turn.dst ∧ turn.src ∈ k.accounts ∧ turn.dst ∈ k.accounts then
          some { k with bal := recTransferBal k.bal turn.src turn.dst a turn.amt }
        else none

so a committed movement DEBITS `(src, a)` and CREDITS `(dst, a)` by `turn.amt` (via `recTransferBal`,
the per-asset debit/credit movement) on the `bal` LEDGER, freezing every other RecordKernelState field.
Because it touches `bal`, the IR body's move is the §A `setBal` primitive — NOT `setCell` (transfer's).
That is the whole structural contrast: transfer ↦ `setCell` over `recTransfer` of the record `balance`;
balanceA ↦ `setBal` over `recTransferBal` of the asset-indexed `bal`. The gate is `recKExecAsset`'s
6-conjunct admissibility `if`, captured verbatim as a `Bool`.

## THE DESCRIPTOR INVESTIGATION (the most load-bearing finding — read this).

balanceA is NOT "covered by transfer's keystone by inheritance". It carries its OWN standalone descriptor
AND full circuit⟺spec soundness — but in a DIFFERENT circuit universe than the one `Argus/Compile.lean`
welds against, so the situation is worth stating precisely:

  * `Argus/Compile.lean` (transfer/mint/burn/createEscrow) welds against the EFFECTVM descriptor universe
    (`transferVmDescriptor`/`mintVmDescriptor`/…, `satisfiedVm`, the per-cell `cellProj` projection). In
    THAT universe there is NO dedicated `balanceAVmDescriptor`: the per-asset move is what the transfer/
    bridge EffectVM row pins (`recTransferBal_src`/`_dst`, `EffectVmEmitBridge`). So at the EffectVM layer,
    balanceA's circuit assurance WOULD be transfer-inherited — there is no separate EffectVM module.

  * But balanceA's GENUINE standalone circuit⟺spec crown jewel lives in the v2 EffectCommit2 / `Surface2`
    universe (`Dregg2/Circuit/Inst/balanceA.lean`): `balanceAE` (the `EffectSpec2` whose touched component
    is the WHOLE `bal` function, a `funcComponent` full-function digest) and
    `balanceA_full_sound : satisfiedE2 … (balanceAE …) … ⟹ BalanceMovementSpec` — a FULL 17-field
    declarative post-state soundness, keyed on the CHAINED executor `recCexecAsset`/`execFullA` via the
    independent `execFullA_balanceA_iff_spec` (`Spec/balancemovement.lean`). This is a SEPARATE, complete
    descriptor — balanceA is its OWN effect there, not transfer's.

So this module is HONEST in both directions:

  (1) **Cornerstone (the standalone executor-refinement the task names):** `interp_balanceAStmt_eq_recKExecAsset`
      — the per-asset RAW-kernel executor `recKExecAsset` IS the Argus term, using `setBal`. New, standalone,
      the per-asset analog of `interp_transferStmt_eq_recKExec`.

  (2) **Compile weld against balanceA's OWN standalone descriptor (the v2 `Surface2` one, NOT transfer-
      inherited):** lift the raw-kernel cornerstone to the chained executor, then weld to the standalone
      `balanceACircuitStep`/`balanceA_full_sound`. The conclusion is the FULL `BalanceMovementSpec` agreement
      (all 17 kernel fields + the receipt log) — a satisfying witness of balanceA's own circuit agrees with
      the WHOLE post-state the IR term's executor produces. Strictly stronger than transfer's per-cell
      EffectVM weld, because balanceA's standalone descriptor carries the whole-state full-function digest.

The honest CHAINED-LAYER contrast carried explicitly (not papered): the raw kernel step `recKExecAsset` gates
on 6 conjuncts; the chained `recCexecAsset`/`execFullA` adds a 7th — `acceptsEffects` at `t.dst` (R1: no
credit into a Sealed/Destroyed cell). The lift theorem `interp_balanceAStmt_chained` carries that dst-liveness
conjunct as an explicit hypothesis, exactly as the kernel layering demands.

## Honesty

`#assert_axioms` on every headline theorem ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; the Poseidon-CR /
whole-function-digest assumption enters ONLY inside the reused `balanceA_full_sound` (its `Function.Injective D`
hypothesis), not in the welded conclusion's statement. No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no `native_decide`. Imports
are read-only; this file owns only itself.

/-! ## §1 — The balanceA effect as an Argus IR term (gate, then the `setBal` ledger move).

`recKExecAsset` is `if <6-conjunct guard> then some { k with bal := recTransferBal … } else none`. We capture
it term-for-term: a `Bool` `guard` of the EXACT 6 conjuncts, then a `setBal` whose leaf is `recTransferBal`
on the `(src,a)`/`(dst,a)` ledger columns. The contrast with transfer is the move primitive: `setBal`
(rewrites `bal`) over `recTransferBal` (the asset-indexed debit/credit), NOT `setCell`/`recTransfer`. -/

/-- The balanceA admissibility gate as a `Bool` — exactly `recKExecAsset`'s `if` (the 6 conjuncts: authority
over `src`, non-negative amount, availability *in asset `a`* on the genuine `bal` ledger, distinctness, and
both cells live accounts). This is the RAW-kernel gate; the chained `recCexecAsset` adds `acceptsEffects` at
`t.dst` on top (carried separately in §3). -/

/-! ## §3 — Lifting the cornerstone to the CHAINED executor `recCexecAsset` / `execFullA`.

The standalone balanceA descriptor (§4) is keyed on the CHAINED executor `recCexecAsset` / `execFullA` over
`RecChainedState` (kernel + receipt log) — the arm `execFullA s (.balanceA t a) = recCexecAsset s t a`. The
§2 cornerstone is over the RAW kernel step `recKExecAsset`. The chained layer is exactly `recKExecAsset` PLUS
two things: an `acceptsEffects` dst-liveness pre-gate (R1: no credit into a non-Live cell) and the receipt-log
prepend `t :: s.log`. We bridge faithfully, carrying the `acceptsEffects` conjunct as an explicit hypothesis
(the honest chained-vs-raw contrast — NOT papered). -/

/-- **`interp_balanceAStmt_chained` — the IR term's executor, lifted to the chained `execFullA`.** When the
destination accepts effects (`acceptsEffects st.kernel t.dst = true`, the chained layer's extra R1 gate) and
the §2 cornerstone commits on the kernel (`interp (balanceAStmt t a) st.kernel = some k'`), the unified action
executor `execFullA st (.balanceA t a)` commits to the chained state `⟨k', t :: st.log⟩`. So the Argus term's
kernel meaning lifts to the chained executor the standalone descriptor speaks about, modulo the carried
dst-liveness side-condition. -/

post-state the IR term's executor interpretation produces.

This welds against balanceA's GENUINE standalone descriptor `balanceACircuitStep S (balanceAE D hD)` (the v2
`Surface2` circuit whose soundness is `balanceA_full_sound`), NOT transfer's circuit — see the descriptor
investigation in this file's header. The executor side is routed through §3 (`interp` ⟹ `execFullA`) and the
independent `execFullA_balanceA_iff_spec` (executor ⟺ `BalanceMovementSpec`); the circuit side is the audited
`balanceA_full_sound` (circuit ⟹ `BalanceMovementSpec`). Both name the SAME `BalanceMovementSpec`, so they
PROVABLY agree on the WHOLE 17-field state — strictly stronger than a per-cell weld. -/

committed value `execFullA st (.balanceA t a) = some ·`, and `some` is injective. This is exactly the sense in
which `BalanceMovementSpec` is functional — it determines the post-state — so the circuit-side and
executor-side spec facts collapse to one welded post-state. -/

Suppose, for the Argus balanceA term `balanceAStmt t a`:
  * the standalone balanceA circuit `balanceACircuit S D hD st t a st'` (= `balanceAE`'s full-state v2
    arithmetization satisfied on the encoded triple) holds, under the realizable whole-function digest portals
    (`hRest : RestIffNoBal S.RH`, `hLog : logHashInjective S.LH`, `hD : Function.Injective D`);
  * the IR term's EXECUTOR interpretation COMMITS on the kernel: `interp (balanceAStmt t a) st.kernel = some k'`
    (`hexec`), with the destination accepting effects (`haccept`, the chained R1 side-condition).

Then the chained post-state the circuit pins is EXACTLY the chained post-state the IR term's executor produces:
`st' = { kernel := k', log := t :: st.log }`. I.e. balanceA's OWN circuit and the IR term AGREE on the WHOLE
17-field RecordKernelState (`bal` debited/credited by `recTransferBal`, every other field frozen) AND the
receipt log — the full `BalanceMovementSpec`, not a per-cell projection. So the circuit the prover runs for
balanceA pins the complete state the IR term's executor produces. -/

/-! ## §6 — FULL-STATE on the RUNNABLE EffectVM descriptor (the magnesium breadth, per-asset entry).

§4 welded balanceA against its OWN standalone v2 `Surface2` circuit (`balanceACircuit` /
`balanceA_full_sound`), whose `satisfiedE2` soundness already pins the COMPLETE `BalanceMovementSpec` (all
17 RecordKernelState fields, the whole-`bal`-function digest). That is full-state, but in the `satisfiedE2`
universe — NOT the `satisfiedVm` / `EffectVmDescriptor` universe (the circuit the EffectVM prover actually
runs row-by-row). As this file's DESCRIPTOR INVESTIGATION states, balanceA carries NO separate
`balanceAVmDescriptor`: at the EffectVM layer its per-asset move is what the TRANSFER row pins on the
`bal_lo` column — the genuine per-asset ledger entry `recTransferBal …` projected onto one cell's balance
limb. So balanceA's RUNNABLE EffectVM descriptor IS `transferVmDescriptorWide` (the magnesium STAGE-4 wide
descriptor, `EffectVmFullStateRunnable.transferVmDescriptorWide`), instantiated per ledger entry.

This section delivers balanceA's full-state-on-RUNNABLE THROUGH that wide descriptor, reusing the GENERIC
`runnable_full_sound` (the crypto is discharged ONCE there, against the NAMED `Poseidon2SpongeCR` portal —
nothing re-assumed here), and WELDS the descriptor-pinned per-entry post-state to `recKExecAsset`'s genuine
per-asset ledger move (`recTransferBal_correct`). The honest CONTRAST with the per-cell `bal_lo` block: the
EffectVM row carries ONE cell's balance limb, so balanceA's two-sided move (debit `(src,a)`, credit
`(dst,a)`) is TWO wide rows — a debit leg (`direction = 1`) and a credit leg (`direction = 0`) — paired at
the turn layer (cited, `TurnEmit`), exactly as the transfer keystone's HONEST BOUNDARY assigns the
two-sided conservation. Each leg's FULL 17-field per-cell post is pinned here. -/

/-! ### §6a — WELD: the descriptor-pinned per-entry post-state IS `recKExecAsset`'s genuine ledger move.

The full-state `balanceA_runnable_full_sound` pins a `CellTransferSpec` per leg; here we confirm that
per-cell move IS the per-asset ledger entry `recKExecAsset` commits, via `recTransferBal_correct` — so the
RUNNABLE descriptor and the §2 cornerstone executor agree on the moved entry (not a fourth spec). The
balanceA-specific content (over the reused transfer descriptor) is exactly this per-asset ledger weld. -/

/-- **`debitLeg_matches_executor` — the SOURCE entry agrees.** When `recKExecAsset` commits
(`interp (balanceAStmt t a) k = some k'`, the §2 cornerstone) with `src ≠ dst`, the DEBIT leg's
descriptor-pinned per-cell post (`CellTransferSpec` at `debitParamsA t`, decoding the projected `(src,a)`
entry) agrees with the executor's debited `(src,a)` ledger entry: `post.balLo = k'.bal t.src a = k.bal
t.src a − t.amt`. So the full-state RUNNABLE leg pins EXACTLY the executor's source debit. -/

/-! ### §6b — NON-VACUITY: a concrete leg satisfies the full clause, and it is refutable.

The full-state lift is hollow if `CellTransferSpec` is never inhabited per-asset. We exhibit a concrete
DEBIT leg (`kB0`/`tB0` from §5: cell 0 holds 30 of asset 0, moves 30 to cell 1) whose projected `(src,a)`
entry `100 → ...` realizes the `debitParamsA` move, and refute a forged post. -/

/-- The DEBIT leg's projected pre-state for `kB0`/`tB0`: cell 0's asset-0 entry is `30`, rest `0`. -/
def debitPreB0 : CellState := cellProjA kB0 tB0.src 0

/-- The DEBIT leg's full post: `bal_lo 30 → 0` (debit by 30), frame frozen, nonce ticked, roots frozen.
A concrete inhabitant of `transferRunnableSpec`'s `fullClause` for balanceA's debit leg. -/
def debitPostB0 : CellState :=
  { debitPreB0 with balLo := 0, nonce := debitPreB0.nonce + 1 }

/-- **`debitLeg_realizes` — NON-VACUITY (witness TRUE).** The DEBIT leg's `fullClause` is INHABITED:
`debitPostB0` is the genuine `debitParamsA tB0` image of `debitPreB0` (`30 → 0`, signed move `−30`, frame
frozen) with frozen roots. So the per-asset full clause is NOT `True`. -/
