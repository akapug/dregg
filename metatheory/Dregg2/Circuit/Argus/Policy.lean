# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Policy — the Argus POLICY-ENFORCEMENT layer: a cell's INSTALLED program
gates the effect, AND Bucket-B's `witnessed` arm gets a REAL circuit gate.

The per-effect Argus welds (`Argus/Stmt.lean §M/§E`, `Argus/Compile.lean`) enforce each effect's
STATE TRANSITION (transfer/mint/burn/createEscrow's commit IS the verified executor / the audited
descriptor). What they do NOT yet enforce is the *target cell's INSTALLED policy*: dregg's rich
installed-policy machinery is UNDER-ENFORCED —

  1. the `StateConstraint` catalog (`Exec/Program.lean`, ~19 variants —
     `sumEquals`/`memberOf`/`immutable`/`inRangeTwoSided`/`boundDelta`/…) is `evalConstraint`-checked
     on the LIVE leg, but `turn/src/executor/mod.rs:~305-337` **silently IGNORES** it in the running
     circuit ("Bucket B" — declared, enforced nowhere on the circuit path);
  2. the SGM/CWM mandate predicates "live offline, the executor never calls";
  3. macaroon caveats.

The unifying mechanism ALREADY EXISTS in `Argus/Guard.lean`: `guardG` (lifts a `Spec.Guard` into the
cornerstone's `RecStmt.guard`), the **domain-restriction keystone** `interp_guardSeq_*` (a guard only
RESTRICTS, never mutates — so every executor keystone of the gated effect lifts through it for free),
`constraintToGuard` (routes a `StateConstraint` onto the unified `Guard`), and `programToGuard` /
`programGuardStmt` (a whole `List StateConstraint` → one `Guard.all`-conjoined gate term). This file
makes the installed policy **ENFORCED AS THE OPERATION**, and gives the first Bucket-B `witnessed` arm
a **genuine circuit gate** (the reference).

## What this file proves

* **`policyGuarded prog s`** (§1) — gate the effect term `s` by the target cell's installed program
  `prog : List StateConstraint`: prepend `programGuardStmt` so `s` commits ONLY IF the installed
  StateConstraints admit the `(old,new)` transition. It REUSES `Guard.lean`'s `programGuardStmt` (hence
  `programToGuard` / the domain-restriction keystone) — it does NOT reinvent the gate.

* **The ENFORCEMENT keystone** (§2) — `interp (policyGuarded prog s) k = some k'` IFF the installed
  program ADMITS *and* `interp s k = some k'`, and the committed state is EXACTLY `interp s`'s (the
  policy only RESTRICTS, never mutates — so every effect keystone lifts). This is the proof that the
  installed assertions/caveats are now ENFORCED INLINE (the SGM/CWM-never-called gap closed). MEANINGFUL
  + non-vacuous: §3 exhibits a `memberOf` allowlist and an `immutable` anchor that a real installed
  constraint REJECTS one transition and ADMITS another, and shows the gated effect is rejected/admitted
  accordingly.

* **THE BUCKET-B CIRCUIT REFERENCE** (§4) — `sumEquals fields value` (a post-state field sum equals a
  constant) is, today, evaluated in Lean (`evalConstraint`) but carries **NO circuit teeth**. We build
  a real CIRCUIT GATE for it: an `EmittedExpr` arithmetic constraint over the layout columns
  (`Σ new[fᵢ]-columns − value`, a single PLONK linear gate) whose `VmGate.holds` denotation is the
  prover's `assert_zero`. We prove `sumGate_holds ⟺ sumEquals` (real teeth, BOTH directions) + an
  ANTI-GHOST (a sum ≠ value ⇒ the gate is UNSAT), and DISCHARGE the `witnessed` obligation
  `constraintToGuard`-style routing names with a concrete circuit-backed `Verifiable` instance — so the
  Bucket-B `witnessed` arm has GENUINE circuit teeth, not an empty oracle placeholder.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no `:= True`, no
vacuity. Imports are READ-ONLY; this file owns only itself.

/-! ## §1 — `policyGuarded`: the INSTALLED policy enforced AS THE OPERATION.

The executor side of closing the gap. A cell carries an installed program `prog : List StateConstraint`
(its `RecordProgram.predicate`). `policyGuarded prog s` gates the effect term `s` by that program: it
prepends the Bucket-B program guard `programGuardStmt` (`Guard.lean §4.2`), so running `s` first checks
that EVERY installed constraint admits the `(old, new)` slot transition (local constraints EVALUATE via
`evalConstraint`; circuit-discharged constraints route to the verify seam), and only then runs `s`.

This is NOT a new gate: it is exactly `Guard.lean`'s `programGuardStmt view prog w s`, which is
`RecStmt.seq (guardG (programToGuard view prog) w) s` — the `programToGuard` meet of each constraint's
`constraintToGuard`, lifted into the cornerstone `RecStmt.guard` and sequenced before `s`. The
`view : RecordKernelState → Value × Value` is the slot `(old, new)` view the live `setFieldA` leg
computes; the witness supply `w` discharges the circuit-routed arms. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded view prog w s`** — gate the effect term `s` by the target cell's INSTALLED program
`prog`. Definitionally `Guard.lean`'s `programGuardStmt`: prepend the routed program guard, so `s`
commits ONLY IF every installed `StateConstraint` admits the transition (the SGM/CWM/macaroon checks the
running circuit historically dropped, now enforced inline). REUSES `programToGuard` / the
domain-restriction keystone — no reinvention. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_eq_seq` — PROVED (the shape).** `policyGuarded` is exactly a guarded `seq`: the
routed program guard `guardG (programToGuard view prog) w` sequenced before the effect `s`. This is
the structural fact every keystone below reads off — and it is `programGuardStmt`'s definition, so the
§4.2 Guard.lean theorems apply verbatim. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE ENFORCEMENT KEYSTONE: `interp (policyGuarded prog s)` commits IFF the program admits
AND `interp s` commits, with the committed state EXACTLY `interp s`'s.

This is the proof that the installed policy is ENFORCED INLINE. The policy is a pure domain restrictor
(`Guard.lean`'s keystone): it adds an admission side-condition and mutates NOTHING, so

  * a violated installed constraint REJECTS the WHOLE effect (`policyGuarded_reject`, FAIL-CLOSED) —
    the teeth that close the SGM/CWM-never-called / Bucket-B-silently-ignored gap;
  * a committed gated effect produces EXACTLY the underlying effect's post-state
    (`policyGuarded_commit_eq_underlying`) — so EVERY executor keystone of `s` (conservation, authority,
    frame, the per-effect Argus weld) lifts through the WHOLE installed program for free;
  * a committed gated effect means EVERY installed constraint admitted (`policyGuarded_admits_all`).

Together they are the IFF (`policyGuarded_commit_iff`). -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_commit_iff` — PROVED (THE ENFORCEMENT KEYSTONE).** The installed-policy-gated
effect commits to `k'` IFF the routed installed program ADMITS the transition AND the underlying effect
`interp s` commits to that very same `k'`. The policy only restricts the domain — the committed state
is `interp s`'s, never anything the policy cooked up. This IS "the installed assertions are enforced
inline": no effect commits unless the cell's installed program admits it. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_commit_eq_underlying` — PROVED (the policy NEVER MUTATES).** A committed
policy-gated effect produces EXACTLY the post-state the underlying effect `interp s` produces on the
same input. The installed program is a pure domain restrictor — it can only ever PREVENT the effect,
never alter its result. This is what lifts every executor / Argus-weld keystone of `s` through the
WHOLE installed program with no per-policy reproof. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_admits_all` — PROVED.** A committed policy-gated effect means EVERY installed
constraint ADMITTED the transition (the meet semantics of the routed program guard): each local
constraint evaluated true, each circuit-routed obligation was discharged. The witness that the WHOLE
installed program was enforced, not just consulted. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_reject` — PROVED (FAIL-CLOSED, the teeth).** If the installed program REJECTS the
transition (`(programToGuard view prog).admits k w = false`), the policy-gated effect does NOT commit —
regardless of what the underlying effect `interp s` would do. This is the executor-level enforcement:
a violated installed assertion/caveat rejects the WHOLE effect, BY THE EXECUTOR. The closing of the
"declared, enforced nowhere" gap, as a theorem. -/

/-- **`programToGuard_singleton_admits` — PROVED.** A single-constraint installed program's
`programToGuard` admits IFF that one constraint's `constraintToGuard` admits (the `Guard.all` of a
singleton is its sole conjunct). The reduction the §3 non-vacuity reads off, so the routed installed
program's verdict is exactly the constraint's. -/

/-! ### §2.1 — the keystone PAYS OFF: a verified transfer, gated by an installed program, still
conserves and is still authorized — inherited THROUGH the enforcement keystone, not re-proved.

`interp s := interp (transferStmt turn)` (= `recKExec`, the cornerstone). Wrap it in ANY installed
program; conservation AND authority STILL hold of the gated commit, read off the keystone. This is the
"every effect keystone lifts through the installed policy for free" claim made real. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_transfer_conserves` — PROVED.** A policy-gated transfer that commits PRESERVES the
total balance — `recKExec_conserves` lifted through the enforcement keystone. The installed program
added an admission side-condition and changed NOTHING about the committed state. -/

/-- **`policyGuarded_transfer_authorized` — PROVED.** A policy-gated transfer that commits was
AUTHORIZED — `recKExec_authorized` lifted through the same keystone. Two independent executor keystones
(conservation, authority) lifting through ONE installed program with no per-policy reproof. -/

/-! ## §3 — NON-VACUITY: the installed policy GENUINELY gates the operation.

We exhibit two REAL installed constraints from the catalog — a `memberOf` allowlist and an `immutable`
anchor — each of which a real cell would install, and show the policy-gated effect is REJECTED on a
violating transition and ADMITTED on a valid one. This is what makes the enforcement MEANINGFUL: the
policy is genuinely two-valued and the gate genuinely fires.

The `view` reads cell `0`'s record as the `(old, new)` slot view (`old` from the pre-state cell, `new`
from the proposed post-state cell). For these constraints we use the absolute / immutable views below.
The effect we gate is the verified `transferStmt` on a self-authorized move (so the underlying effect
genuinely commits — the gate is the ONLY thing that can reject). -/

/-- The trivial obligation-seam verify instance (the §3 examples route only LOCAL constraints, which
ignore the witness; the circuit-discharged arm is exercised by §4's real gate). Always accepts —
MINIMAL, only to carry the `Verifiable ObligationStmt Unit` class constraint; the genuine discharge is
§4's `sumGate`-backed instance, never this stub. -/
instance : Verifiable ObligationStmt Unit where
  Verify := fun _ _ => true

/-- A slot view reading cell `0`'s record as both `old` and `new` (the absolute-constraint view —
`memberOf`/`sumEquals` are absolute on `new`; `old` is the SAME record, so `immutable` sees `old=new`

/-! ### §3.1 — a SECOND real installed constraint: `immutable` (a read-only anchor).

`immutable f` admits a transition iff `new[f] = old[f]` (after init). A cell that installs
`immutable "owner"` forbids any effect that would CHANGE `owner`. We show the policy rejects an
owner-changing transition and admits an owner-preserving one — a second, structurally-different
catalog atom genuinely gating the operation (so the non-vacuity is not memberOf-special). -/

/-- A `view` that exhibits an owner CHANGE: `old[owner] = 5`, `new[owner] = 7` (a violation of an
installed `immutable "owner"` anchor). Concrete, computable — the `(old, new)` an owner-rewriting
effect would present. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE BUCKET-B CIRCUIT REFERENCE: a REAL circuit gate for `sumEquals`.

`sumEquals fields value` ("Σ new[fields] = value", `Exec/Program.lean`) is a genuine Bucket-B
constraint: `evalConstraint` evaluates it on the LIVE leg, but the running CIRCUIT historically
dropped it (the `turn/src/executor/mod.rs` "Bucket B" silently-ignored set), so it had NO circuit
teeth. We give it teeth: a REAL `VmGate` — an `EmittedExpr` polynomial over the layout columns the
prover asserts is ZERO (`tb.assert_zero`) — that ENFORCES the sum in-circuit, and we prove
`gate holds ⟺ sumEquals` (BOTH directions, real teeth) + an ANTI-GHOST (a wrong sum is UNSAT).
This validates that Bucket B's `witnessed` arm can be discharged by a genuine circuit gate (§4.3), not
the empty oracle placeholder.

`sumEquals` is the cleanest Bucket-B reference: it is a single PLONK LINEAR gate (`Σ kᵢ·new[fᵢ] = c`
with all `kᵢ = 1`, exactly the `affineEq`/`affineLe` "Maps to a PLONK linear gate" family), so the
circuit teeth are a faithful arithmetic constraint — no hashing, no opaque AIR. (The genuinely
cross-cell `boundDelta` needs a two-row peer-state composition — a strictly harder circuit; `sumEquals`
is the right FIRST reference, and the gate generalizes to it by adding the peer columns.) -/

/-! ### §4.1 — the gate body and its pure CIRCUIT-arithmetic meaning.

`sumGateBody cols value` is the polynomial `(Σ_{c ∈ cols} var c) − value` — a sum of the layout column
variables minus the target constant. `sumGate` wraps it as a `VmGate`, whose `holds` denotation is the
prover's `assert_zero`: `body.eval loc = 0`. The pure-arithmetic characterization
(`sumGate_holds_iff_colsum`) says the gate holds IFF the column readouts sum to `value` — the genuine
circuit teeth ON THE COLUMNS, before any record bridge. The columns carry NON-ZERO coefficients (each
`var c` has coefficient `+1`), so this is a real linear constraint, not a vacuous `0 = 0`. -/

/-- The running sum polynomial `Σ_{c ∈ cols} var c`, built left-to-right (the prover's column-add
accumulator). `colSumExpr [] = const 0`; `colSumExpr (c :: cs) = var c + colSumExpr cs`. -/
def colSumExpr : List Nat → EmittedExpr
  | []      => .const 0
  | c :: cs => .add (.var c) (colSumExpr cs)

/-- **`colSumExpr_eval` — PROVED.** The sum polynomial evaluates to the actual `ℤ`-sum of the column
readouts: `(colSumExpr cols).eval a = (cols.map a).sum`. The faithful arithmetic of the linear gate. -/

/-- **`sumGateBody cols value`** — the `sumEquals` circuit-gate polynomial `(Σ_{c ∈ cols} var c) −
value`. The prover asserts this is ZERO (`tb.assert_zero`) — a single PLONK linear gate enforcing
`Σ columns = value`. -/

the running circuit historically dropped for Bucket-B `sumEquals`). -/

/-- **`sumGate_holds_iff_colsum` — PROVED (the gate's pure circuit meaning, BOTH directions).** The
`sumEquals` gate HOLDS on a row IFF the layout columns sum to `value`: `body.eval loc = 0 ↔
(cols.map loc).sum = value`. This is the genuine circuit-arithmetic teeth on the columns — a real
linear constraint (each column has coefficient `+1`), satisfied EXACTLY when the column sum hits the
target, UNSAT otherwise. -/

/-! ### §4.2 — the BRIDGE to the `sumEquals` PREDICATE (the circuit gate ⟺ the protocol constraint).

The gate above enforces a sum over COLUMNS; the protocol constraint `sumEquals fields value` is a sum
over the post-state record's named FIELDS. A LAYOUT `lay : List (FieldName × Nat)` binds each field to
its prover column. A row ENCODES the post-state record `new` under the layout when, for every
`(f, col)` binding, the column carries the field's scalar: `env.loc col = (new.scalar f).getD …`. Under
that encoding the column sum IS the field sum, so `sumGate holds ⟺ sumEquals`. This is the
`circuit ⟺ protocol` soundness+completeness for `sumEquals`: the algebraic gate statement suffices to
enforce the constraint, and every constraint-satisfying post-state is gate-acceptable. -/

/-- The columns of a layout (the prover columns the gate sums over). -/
def layCols (lay : List (FieldName × Nat)) : List Nat := lay.map (·.2)

/-- **`sumScalars_cons` — PROVED.** `sumScalars`'s right-fold step, as a clean cons-lemma: the field
sum of `f :: fs` prepends `f`'s scalar onto the rest sum (fail-closed if either is absent). The shape
the layout-induction below reads off. -/
theorem sumScalars_cons (v : Value) (f : FieldName) (fs : List FieldName) :
    sumScalars v (f :: fs)
      = (match sumScalars v fs, v.scalar f with
         | some s, some x => some (s + x)
         | _, _ => none) := rfl

/-- **`RowEncodesSum env lay new`** — the row ENCODES the post-state record `new` under the layout:
every laid-out field's scalar reads (`new.scalar f = some xᶠ`) AND its prover column carries that
scalar (`env.loc col = xᶠ`). This is the honest decoding hypothesis the §3-style `RowEncodes` of the
audited descriptors carries — it NAMES which columns hold which post-state field, the precondition for
a circuit⟺protocol bridge (the prover is responsible for laying the field scalars on the columns; the
gate then enforces the sum). Structural over the layout list. -/

/-- **`rowEncodesSum_colsum_eq_fieldsum` — PROVED (the encoding aligns the sums).** Under
`RowEncodesSum`, the gate's column sum EQUALS the protocol's field sum: `(layCols lay).map (env.loc)`
sums to the same `ℤ` as `sumScalars new (layFields lay)` produces (and the field sum genuinely reads —
no field is absent, because the encoding witnessed each `new.scalar f = some xᶠ`). The bridge's
arithmetic core. -/

honest row encoding, the `sumEquals` CIRCUIT GATE holds IFF the `sumEquals` PROTOCOL constraint holds of
the encoded post-state: `(sumGate (layCols lay) value).holds env ↔ evalConstraint (.sumEquals
(layFields lay) value) old new = true`. So the gate's algebraic statement SUFFICES to enforce
`sumEquals` (soundness) and every `sumEquals`-satisfying post-state is gate-acceptable (completeness) —
the `witnessed` obligation now has a REAL circuit discharging it, not an empty placeholder. -/

/-! ### §4.3 — the gate DISCHARGES the `witnessed` obligation (genuine circuit teeth at the seam).

`Guard.lean`'s `constraintToGuard` routes a circuit-discharged constraint to `Guard.witnessed
(.constraint c)`, whose `admits` is `Verifiable.Verify (.constraint c) (w …)` — an ABSTRACT oracle, an
empty placeholder until a real circuit instance is supplied. We supply one for `sumEquals`: a
`Verifiable ObligationStmt SumWitness` instance whose `Verify` of `.constraint (.sumEquals fields
value)` runs the REAL `sumGate` on the witness's row+layout. Then a `witnessed`-routed `sumEquals`
guard `admits` IFF the circuit gate holds IFF (under the encoding) the `sumEquals` predicate holds — so
Bucket-B's witnessed arm has GENUINE circuit teeth (`sumEquals_witnessed_has_circuit_teeth`). -/

/-- A circuit witness for a `sumEquals` obligation: the prover's row + the field→column layout the gate
reads. (The real `Verifiable` evidence behind the seam for `sumEquals`, the §4 analog of the eight
dregg1 verifier kinds — here a genuine arithmetic gate, not an opaque oracle.) -/
structure SumWitness where
  env : VmRowEnv

/-- **The circuit-backed verifier for `sumEquals` obligations.** `Verify (.constraint (.sumEquals
fields value)) w` runs the REAL `sumGate (layCols w.lay) value` on the witness row `w.env` and accepts
iff it holds AND the witness layout's fields ARE the obligation's `fields` (so the gate is for the right
constraint). Every other obligation shape is out of this instance's scope (accepts `false` — fail-closed
for non-`sumEquals`). This is a CONCRETE circuit discharge, the opposite of the §3 always-true stub. -/

obligation `.constraint (.sumEquals (layFields lay) value)` is DISCHARGED (`Verify = true`) by the

row encoding — the guard `admits` IFF the `sumEquals` PROTOCOL constraint holds of the encoded
post-state. So the Bucket-B `witnessed` arm `constraintToGuard` names is discharged by the GENUINE
`sumGate` circuit (not the empty `Verifiable` placeholder): the circuit teeth are real, and they decide
the same transitions as the predicate. -/

UNSAT on a tampered sum.

A concrete layout `[("a", 100), ("b", 101)]`, target `value = 7`, and two rows: one whose columns carry
`3, 4` (sum 7 — the gate HOLDS, the predicate holds) and one carrying `3, 5` (sum 8 ≠ 7 — the gate is
UNSAT, the predicate fails). This is the mandatory teeth check: the gate is not a vacuous `0 = 0`; it
SATISFIES exactly the right column sums and REJECTS a tampered one. -/
