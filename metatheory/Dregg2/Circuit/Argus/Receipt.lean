# Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Receipt — the Argus IR welded to the RECEIPT protocol layer (Q = cellCommit).

`Argus/Stmt.lean` laid the cornerstone: a `RecStmt` term has TWO interpretations of ONE term —
`interp` (the executor, `interp (transferStmt turn) = recKExec` by construction) and (in `Compile.lean`)
the EffectVM circuit. `CommitmentCrossBind.lean` proved the MID-4 crown: the system's THREE disjoint
state commitments (`recStateCommit` the circuit root, `recSetFieldCommit` the executor receipt-chain
root, `cellCommit` the running BLAKE3 cell commitment) cross-bind to ONE authenticated state object,
and a satisfying CIRCUIT or EXECUTOR proof CONSTRAINS the running cell's canonical commitment
(`stateCommit_binds_cellCommit` / `setFieldCommit_binds_cellCommit`).

But the crown is stated over ABSTRACT states `k`/`k'`: nothing said the `k'` it talks about IS what an
Argus *term* PRODUCES. This file welds that last seam — **the receipt protocol layer Q = cellCommit, the
unified per-cell receipt the running node publishes, applied to the state an Argus term produces.** The
new content is the CONNECTION (the Argus-produced state IS what the cross-bind layer cross-binds), NOT
the crypto: every binding fact is REUSED verbatim from `CommitmentCrossBind`, every executor fact from
the Argus cornerstones; this module derives no collision-resistance.

## THE LAYER, named precisely (read-only reuse — file:line)

  * `CommitmentCrossBind.cellCommit_determined` (`CommitmentCrossBind.lean:135`) — equal cell `Value`s
    ⟹ equal canonical `cellCommit`. The receipt Q is a TOTAL FUNCTION of the committed cell.
  * `CommitmentCrossBind.LeafIsCellCommit` (`:341`) — the named portal: the StateCommit/SetFieldCommit
    per-cell leaf hash `CH` FACTORS THROUGH `cellCommit` (the in-circuit leaf IS the running BLAKE3
    receipt of the cell). REALIZABLE, witnessed both ways in `CommitmentCrossBind §5` — REUSED, not
    re-asserted.
  * `CommitmentCrossBind.stateCommit_binds_cellCommit` (`:350`) — equal CIRCUIT roots ⟹ equal `cellCommit`
    per live cell (under `LeafIsCellCommit` + the standard CR set). The CROWN's circuit corner.
  * `CommitmentCrossBind.setFieldCommit_binds_cellCommit` (`:378`) — equal EXECUTOR receipt-chain roots ⟹
    equal `cellCommit` per live cell. The CROWN's executor corner.
  * `Argus.interp` / `Argus.interp_transferStmt_eq_recKExec` (`Stmt.lean:90/161`) — the executor
    interpretation of a `RecStmt` term, and the cornerstone that the transfer term's `interp` IS the
    verified `recKExec`.

## WHAT THIS FILE CONNECTS (the genuine weld, not crypto)

  * **§1 Q is determined by the Argus-produced state.** `argusReceipt` IS `cellCommit` of a cell of the
    state an Argus term produces (`interp st k = some k'` names `k'`, the produced state; Q reads `k'.cell c`).
    `argus_receipt_determined` / `argus_receipt_wellDefined` pin that the receipt is a TOTAL FUNCTION of
    the Argus output — the "ONE Q for the produced state" the layer needs but could not name without the IR.

  * **§2 THE CONNECTION KEYSTONE — an Argus-produced state commits to ONE authenticated Q across the
    corners.** `argus_commits_to_one_receipt`: when an Argus term COMMITS (`interp st k = some k'`), and
    BOTH the circuit root (`recStateCommit … k' t`) and the executor receipt-chain root
    (`recSetFieldCommit … k' cell log`) are pinned to the SAME published values as a SECOND witnessed
    state `k₂`'s roots (the cross-AIR / cross-proof PI binding the running protocol enforces), then the
    Argus-produced cell's receipt `cellCommit` and `k₂`'s coincide on every live cell — the circuit proof
    AND the executor receipt-chain proof both pin the SAME Q of the SAME Argus-produced state. This is the
    MID-4 close *for the IR*: "the state an Argus term produces commits to ONE authenticated receipt."

  * **§3 THE TRANSFER INSTANTIATION (the cornerstone carries Q).** `transfer_commits_to_one_receipt`:
    routing the §2 keystone through `interp_transferStmt_eq_recKExec`, the produced state IS the verified
    executor output `recKExec k turn`, so a satisfying circuit/executor proof of the transfer term pins the
    canonical receipt of the cell the VERIFIED EXECUTOR produces — the receipt Q the node publishes for
    that turn is the receipt of the by-construction-correct post-state.

## SCOPE — what CONNECTS vs the named GAP (do NOT over-read)

  * CONNECTS: the receipt Q (`cellCommit`) of the Argus-produced state is forced equal across the
    circuit-root corner and the executor-receipt-chain corner, on every LIVE cell, under the SAME
    realizable portals the crown carries. The Argus term's `interp` output is the state the receipt is OF.
  * The NAMED GAP — **the shape-AIR / PI-binding hypothesis** (`hRootPI`/`hSFRootPI`): this weld assumes
    the two roots are pinned to the SAME published value (the cross-AIR public-input binding). That binding
    is the running prover's PI equation, not re-derived here — it is the SAME residual `CommitmentCrossBind
    §3` carries (the `hPI : RH k = RH k'` shape) and `Argus/Compile.lean`'s SCOPE flags (the
    descriptor is a single-row AIR; the published-root cross-binding is the turn-composition layer). We
    EXPOSE it as an explicit hypothesis, NOT a `:= True`. The H4-descriptor field-subset widening (MID-4
    R1, tasks #36/#37/#91) is likewise OUT OF SCOPE: we bind to `cellCommit`, the canonical receipt the H4
    chain encodes, exactly as the crown does.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on the keystones ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. No `sorry`, no `:= True`,
no vacuity-that-typechecks. §4 exhibits the receipt as an OBSERVABLE function (a tampered Argus output
moves Q; the produced state's receipt is non-trivial). Imports are READ-ONLY; this file owns only its own
declarations (it imports `Argus/Stmt`, `Argus/Compile`, `CommitmentCrossBind` and edits none).

/-! ## §1 — Q = the receipt the Argus-produced state commits to (a total function of the output).

The receipt protocol layer publishes, per cell, the canonical commitment `cellCommit` (the running
BLAKE3 v3 cell receipt). When an Argus term COMMITS — `interp st k = some k'` — the *produced* state is
`k'`, and the cell's receipt is `cellCommit … (k'.cell c)`. The crown talked about `cellCommit` of an
abstract state; here it is the receipt OF THE ARGUS OUTPUT. We first pin that this is well-defined: the
produced state determines Q (equal Argus outputs ⟹ equal receipt), the "ONE Q" the layer needs. -/

/-- **`argusReceipt compressN compress2 restLimbs st k c`** — the RECEIPT the Argus term `st` (run on
`k`) publishes for cell `c`: the canonical `cellCommit` of the produced cell `(interp st k).map (·.cell c)`
(`none` if the term rejected). `restLimbs c` is the cell's authority-bearing limb prefix (the abstract
`rest` of `RecordCommit`, the SAME family the crown's `LeafIsCellCommit` factors through). This IS the
unified Q the cross-bind layer binds the circuit/executor roots to — now keyed by the IR term. -/

  (interp st k).map (fun k' => cellCommit compressN compress2 (restLimbs c) (k'.cell c))

/-- **`argus_receipt_some_iff`.** The receipt for `c` is published (`some`) IFF the Argus term
COMMITS, and its value is the `cellCommit` of the produced cell. So the receipt is exactly defined on the
terms that produce a state — the protocol publishes Q precisely when there is a post-state to receipt. -/

/-- **`argus_receipt_determined`.** Equal Argus outputs ⟹ equal receipt: the receipt Q is a
TOTAL FUNCTION of the state the term produces. This is the "ONE authenticated Q for the produced state"
the cross-bind layer needs but could not state without the IR — the receipt cannot disagree about a state
the Argus term pins. (Lifts `CommitmentCrossBind.cellCommit_determined` from an abstract `Value` equality
to the Argus-output equality.) -/

/-! ## §2 — THE CONNECTION KEYSTONE: the Argus-produced state commits to ONE authenticated Q.

The weld. An Argus term COMMITS to a produced state `k'` (`interp st k = some k'`). The running protocol
publishes that turn's circuit root `recStateCommit … k' t` AND its executor receipt-chain root
`recSetFieldCommit … k' cell log`. Suppose both are pinned (the cross-AIR / cross-proof PI binding) to the
SAME published values as a SECOND witnessed state `k₂`'s roots — the cross-binding the crown studies. Then
BOTH the circuit corner (`stateCommit_binds_cellCommit`) AND the executor corner
(`setFieldCommit_binds_cellCommit`) force the Argus-produced cell's receipt `cellCommit` to coincide with
`k₂`'s, on every live cell. So a circuit proof and an executor receipt-chain proof of the SAME published
roots both pin the SAME receipt Q of the SAME Argus-produced state — the MID-4 close, for the IR. -/

/-- **`argus_commits_to_one_receipt` — THE CONNECTION KEYSTONE.** The MID-4 close FOR THE IR.
An Argus term commits to a produced state `k'`; the protocol publishes that turn's receipt Q for cell `c`
as the canonical commitment of the ACTUAL produced cell, `q := cellCommit … (k'.cell c)`. When BOTH the
circuit root and the executor receipt-chain root over `k'` are pinned (the cross-AIR / cross-proof
published-root binding) to a SECOND witnessed state `k₂`, then for every live cell in the COMMON carrier
(`frameCarrier k' t ∩ sfFrameCarrier k' cell` — the cells both corners bind):
  (i)   the protocol's published receipt for `c` IS `q`, the receipt of the ARGUS-PRODUCED cell
        (`argusReceipt … = some q`, from the commit fact — NOT from either corner);
  (ii)  the CIRCUIT corner forces that produced-cell receipt `q` to EQUAL `k₂`'s canonical receipt; and
  (iii) the EXECUTOR receipt-chain corner forces the SAME `q` to EQUAL `k₂`'s canonical receipt.
Both (ii) and (iii) are GENUINELY derived (neither is `rfl`: `q` is the produced cell's receipt, not
pre-set to `k₂`'s — each corner's binding is doing real work). So the circuit proof and the executor
receipt-chain proof of the Argus-produced state AGREE on ONE authenticated receipt Q — the canonical
commitment of the cell the IR term produced. "The state an Argus term produces commits to ONE
authenticated receipt." -/

`qc = k₂`'s receipt under `hRootPI`) AND the EXECUTOR receipt-chain corner is forced to pin it to `qe`
(`qe = k₂`'s receipt under `hSFRootPI`), then `qc = qe` — the two independently-published roots CANNOT
disagree about the Argus-produced cell's receipt, *because both equal the one `argusReceipt` the produced
state determines*. We surface `qc`/`qe` as the two corners' bindings of the published receipt and conclude
their equality through the shared `argusReceipt` value (NOT by `rfl` on a pre-identified term). -/

/-! ## §4 — NON-VACUITY: the Argus receipt Q is an OBSERVABLE function of the produced state.

The weld would be hollow if Q were constant. We REUSE `CommitmentCrossBind`'s realizable INJECTIVE toy
carriers (`cNC` the positional Horner sponge, `c2C` the leaf combiner, `restLimbsC` a per-cell prefix) and
exhibit a concrete Argus term whose produced state's receipt is sensitive — a tampered cell value
MOVES the receipt — and whose committing run PUBLISHES a receipt. So `argusReceipt` is a real, observable
function of the Argus output, not a vacuous placeholder. -/

-- ANTI-GHOST (the receipt is OBSERVABLE): two Argus terms that write DIFFERENT cell-`0` values publish

Under the realizable canonical-commitment CR carriers (`compressNInjective compressN` + the tail-leaf
injectivity `listLeafInjective (tailLeaf compress2)`, the SAME set `cellCommit_binds_tail` consumes), if
two Argus terms `writeCell0 v` / `writeCell0 w` publish the SAME receipt for cell `0`, then the produced
cells have the SAME committed user-field tail. CONTRAPOSITIVE: two terms producing cells with DISTINCT user
tails publish DISTINCT receipts — Q is a genuine, observable function of the Argus output that catches a
tampered cell map. Abstract (no kernel `decide` on a concrete sponge), strictly more meaningful than a
single concrete pair: it lifts `RecordCommit.cellCommit_binds_tail` onto the Argus receipt. -/

The contrapositive of the binding lemma, instantiated: two Argus terms producing cells whose user-field
tails DIFFER (`htail`) publish DIFFERENT receipts. So the receipt Q depends on the state the
Argus term produces — the weld is non-vacuous (Q is not a constant oracle). REUSES the carrier set the
crown uses; the distinct-tail premise is witnessed below (`#guard`, two records differing at key `"8"`). -/
