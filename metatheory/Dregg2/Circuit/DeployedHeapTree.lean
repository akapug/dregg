# `DeployedHeapTree` — the native 8-felt heap-tree spine (Phase H-HEAP-8).

The SECOND faithful root's Lean spine, the exact twin of `DeployedCapTree`'s `Cap8Scheme`. The
deployed heap tree is a sorted-Poseidon2 binary Merkle map over LINKED IMT leaves
`(addr, value, nextAddr)` (`heap_root.rs::HeapLeaf` — the gap-#5 indexed-Merkle-tree rewiring:
the third field is the POINTER to the next-larger present address, the sorted-linked-list link
`IndexedMerkleTree.ImtLeaf`/`imtLeafHash`; nodes `mapNode hash l r = hash [l, r]`). The
historical commitment projected each node/leaf to a SINGLE felt (`hash : List ℤ → ℤ`, ~2^31), well
below the deployed FRI/STARK ~124-bit soundness floor: two genuinely-different heaps can collide on
the 1-felt root while topping different 8-felt roots (the heap GENTIAN tooth
`circuit/tests/heap_root_gentian_weld.rs` exhibits a concrete pair). This module gives the FAITHFUL
8-felt heap tree — every node absorbs full 8-felt children through the arity-16 `node8` chip and emits
a full 8-felt digest — and the ONE new width-specific obligation its anti-ghost needs.

REUSE (the Option-A payoff, exactly as for cap): the membership-recompose anti-ghost spine
(`CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeG_inj_of_path`) is digest-type-AGNOSTIC and already proved once, so the
heap 8-felt migration collapses to `heapNodeOf8_injective` (the sole width-specific lemma) plus a pure
re-instantiation of the generic. `Digest8`, `Compress8CR`, and `pack8`/`pack8_inj` are shared verbatim
from `DeployedCapTree` — cap/heap/fields all ride the ONE `node8` compression
(`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes` at `CHIP_NODE8_ARITY = 16`).

lanes). BOTH the leaf (`heapLeafDigest8`, arity 3 — the IMT `[addr, value, nextAddr]`) and the node
(`heapNodeOf8`, arity 16) ride it; the input lists are length-disjoint (3 vs 16), so the chip's
per-row `(arity, padded inputs)` seeding separates the two domains for free. The exact twin of

over the 3 LINKED-leaf fields `[addr, value, nextAddr]` (the gap-#5 IMT leaf — the pointer is IN the
digest, `IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash`'s 8-felt twin). BYTE-IDENTICAL to
`heap_root.rs::HeapLeaf::digest8` (`chip_absorb_all_lanes(3, [addr, value, next_addr])`). -/

/-- **Leaf injectivity at 8-felt width** — distinct `(addr, value, nextAddr)` triples yield distinct
8-felt digests, by the 8-output chip CR composed with the `[e.1, e.2.1, e.2.2]` list being injective
in the triple. The heap twin of `capLeafDigest8_injective` (and the 8-felt `imtLeafHash_injective`):
the digest binds the POINTER too, so a prover cannot relink the sorted chain while keeping the leaf. -/

/-- **THE ONE NEW OBLIGATION — node injectivity at 8-felt width.** Equal `heapNodeOf8` images ⇒ equal
8-felt children. PROVED by the arity-16 chip's collision-resistance (`Compress8CR`) composed with
`pack8` injectivity — the per-level peel the native-8-felt membership recompose's anti-ghost needs.
This is the SOLE width-specific lemma the heap `node8` migration adds; the recompose spine is reused,
not re-proved. The exact twin of `DeployedCapTree.Cap8Scheme.nodeOf8_injective`. -/

/-- **`recomposeUp8 S8 cur path`** — the native-8-felt heap membership recompose, DEFINED as the
generic `CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeG` at `D := Digest8`, `node := heapNodeOf8 S8`. No bespoke
recursion — the SAME generic spine cap rides. BYTE-IDENTICAL to `heap_root.rs::recompose_membership_8`
and to the deployed in-circuit `node8` MapOps chain (unified onto `BUS_P2`). -/

  CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeG (heapNodeOf8 S8) cur path

/-- **The native-8-felt heap anti-ghost spine — a PURE RE-INSTANTIATION.** `recomposeUp8` is injective
in its starting digest along a fixed path, by `CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeG_inj_of_path` fed the ONE new
obligation `heapNodeOf8_injective`. NO spine re-proof: the SAME generic theorem the 1-felt tree and the
cap tree delegate to. A prover cannot keep the published 8-felt heap root while swapping the opened leaf
along a fixed path. -/

/-- **`MembersAt8 S8 root e`** — the native-8-felt deployed heap-tree membership of a `(addr, value)`
PAIR: SOME linked leaf `(addr, value, next)` opens against the FULL 8-felt `root` (the IMT pointer is
existential at the map level — a map speaks `key → value`; the pointer is the sorted-chain plumbing).
The HONEST 8-felt replacement for the lossy 1-felt opening — opens against ~124-bit of root, not
lane-0. The heap twin of `DeployedCapTree.Cap8Scheme.MembersAt8`. -/

/-- **The GENTIAN close, in Lean.** Two LINKED heap leaves opening the SAME 8-felt root along the SAME
path are the SAME leaf (addr, value, AND pointer): the 8-felt root binds the opened triple at full
~124-bit width, so a colliding-lane-0 forge (different entry, same 1-felt projection) cannot also open
the 8-felt root. The membership predicate is functional in the leaf along a fixed path. -/
