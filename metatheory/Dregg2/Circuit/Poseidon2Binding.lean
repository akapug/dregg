# Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2Binding — grounding the injectivity portals on Poseidon2 CR.

`StateCommit` parameterizes the WHOLE per-effect circuit-soundness tower (`transfer_circuit_full_sound`
and the generic `effect_circuit_full_sound`) over three abstract HASH-INJECTIVITY portals:

  * `compressNInjective compressN` — the frame sponge over a list of leaves is injective.
  * `cellLeafInjective CH`         — a fixed cell's leaf hash binds its whole `Value`.
  * `logHashInjective LH`          — the receipt-chain hash binds the turn list.

Until now NO concrete hash discharged these, so full-state soundness held only "relative to an
injective hash the system never instantiates". This module closes that gap by deriving all three
from a SINGLE, explicit, named cryptographic assumption:

  **`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`** : `∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys`.

This is collision-resistance of the in-circuit Poseidon2 sponge (`Poseidon2Emit.spongeCompressN`,
proved faithful to the emitted `merkle_hash` chain by `emit_faithful_poseidon2_compress`). It is the
EXACT shape `Crypto.PortalFloor.{Poseidon2Kernel,Blake3Kernel}.noCollision` already carries — CR
as injectivity on the idealized hash domain — and it is REALIZABLE (a real Poseidon2 satisfies it; a
`+`-fold does NOT, see `compressNInjective`'s doc). We carry it as an explicit Prop HYPOTHESIS (never
an `axiom`), so every theorem here pins exactly `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

## The factoring (one crypto assumption, the rest is serialization)

  * `compressNInjective compressN` is LITERALLY `Poseidon2SpongeCR compressN` — the frame digest's
    sponge IS a list-hash. No encoder; the two Props are definitionally interchangeable
    (`compressNInjective_of_poseidon2CR`). This is the load-bearing one (it grounds the frame).

  * `cellLeafInjective CH` / `logHashInjective LH` need the hash applied to a *structured* input
    (`(c, v)` / `List Turn`). A Poseidon2 leaf/log hash FACTORS as `sponge ∘ encode` for an
    INJECTIVE serialization `encode`. We package "`CH`/`LH` factor through the CR sponge via an
    injective encoder" as a `LeafRealization` / `LogRealization` bundle. Encoder-injectivity is NOT
    a cryptographic assumption (a canonical serialization is provably injective — the toy
    `Reference` instances below exhibit injective encoders and discharge CR with `True`); it is an
    separate STRUCTURAL field, while CR is the SOLE crypto carrier.

The toy `Reference` realizations (over injective `ℤ`
encoders + `True`-discharged CR) witness non-vacuity: every derivation fires on a real instance.

/-! ## §0 — the REAL p3-poseidon2-circuit-air parameter descriptor (the bridge's pointee).

`Poseidon2SpongeCR` is a NAMED bridge assumption: verified-Lean soundness rests on it, PROVIDED the
actual prover uses the real efficient Poseidon2 AIR. For the bridge to point at the RIGHT object, we
must pin EXACTLY which Poseidon2 the sponge is — same field, width, rate, capacity, S-box degree,
rounds, round-constant source — as the Rust `p3-poseidon2-circuit-air` (emberian/plonky3-recursion
rev `c14b5fc079af18d7f3ba3f3586f173bd166c7cd4`) actually computes.

The Rust prover's canonical hashing config (the one `CircuitBuilder::add_hash_slice` defaults to, and
the only BabyBear permutation the recursion uses for MMCS/FRI/sponge — see `circuit/src/ops/hash.rs`
and `circuit/src/ops/poseidon2_perm/config.rs::Poseidon2Config::BABY_BEAR_D4_W16`) is:

```text
  field            = BabyBear   (p = 2^31 - 2^27 + 1)
  d (ext degree)   = 4          (quartic; D=4 challenges)
  width            = 16         (permutation state, base elements)
  sbox_degree      = 7
  sbox_registers   = 1
  half_full_rounds = 4          (=> 8 full rounds)
  partial_rounds   = 13
  -- derived by the Rust `const fn`s (rate_ext / capacity_ext, D>1 branch):
  capacity_ext     = 2          (D>1: always 2)          => capacity = capacity_ext*d = 8 base
  rate_ext         = width/d - capacity_ext = 16/4 - 2 = 2  => rate = rate_ext*d = 8 base
  width_ext        = rate_ext + capacity_ext = 4
  round constants  = BABYBEAR_POSEIDON2_RC_16_{EXTERNAL_INITIAL,INTERNAL,EXTERNAL_FINAL}
  linear layers    = GenericPoseidon2LinearLayersBabyBear (canonical Poseidon2 MDS/internal)
  sponge mode      = PaddingFreeSponge, absorb rate_ext-chunks, squeeze rate_ext (overwrite mode)
```

`Poseidon2RealParams` records this bundle; the `#guard`s below RE-DERIVE `rate_ext`/`capacity_ext`/
`width_ext` with the SAME formulas as the Rust `const fn`s, so a drift in either side breaks the
build. This is the encoded correspondence: the bridge assumption `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is now
documented as being about the sponge of `babyBearD4W16` specifically — the real fast circuit's hash —
not "some injective sponge the system never instantiates". -/

/-! ## §1 — the single named cryptographic assumption: Poseidon2 sponge collision-resistance. -/

/-- **`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`** — ⚠ **BROKEN / VACUOUS AT REAL PARAMS.** This is stated as
INJECTIVITY, which is FALSE for any real (range-bounded) sponge — collisions EXIST by cardinality, they
are merely hard to FIND. `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES this floor false at
the deployed BabyBear parameters, so every theorem conditioned on it is vacuously true. KEPT for the
record; the honest computational replacement is `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`.

The SOLE crypto assumption (as originally intended): the Poseidon2 sponge
`sponge : List ℤ → ℤ` is collision-resistant, i.e. injective on the idealized hash domain. This is
the `Crypto.PortalFloor.Blake3Kernel.noCollision`/`Poseidon2Kernel.noCollision` shape (CR stated as
injectivity), specialized to the `ℤ`-valued sponge `StateCommit`/`Poseidon2Emit` use. REALIZABLE by
a real Poseidon2 (a `+`-fold falsifies it). Carried as a Prop HYPOTHESIS, never an `axiom`.

THE BRIDGE: the `sponge` this CR is asserted about is intended to be the PaddingFreeSponge over the
real `babyBearD4W16` Poseidon2 permutation (`p3-poseidon2-circuit-air`, BabyBear width-16, rate-8) —
the SAME hash the fast prover extracts and proves. `Poseidon2RealizedSponge` packages that intent:
the CR carrier together with the concrete real parameters it is realized at, so the named assumption
documents EXACTLY which efficient Poseidon2 it bridges to. -/
def Poseidon2SpongeCR (sponge : List ℤ → ℤ) : Prop := ∀ xs ys : List ℤ, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys

/-- **`Poseidon2RealizedSponge sponge`** — the bridge made explicit: a sponge carries (1) the real
p3 parameter descriptor it is realized at and (2) the CR assumption ON THAT sponge. Pinning `params`
to `babyBearD4W16` (the only config the bundle's `params_are_real` allows) is what makes
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` a bridge to the REAL fast Poseidon2 rather than an abstract injective hash. -/
structure Poseidon2RealizedSponge (sponge : List ℤ → ℤ) where
  /-- The real p3-poseidon2-circuit-air parameter bundle this sponge is extracted at. -/
  params : Poseidon2RealParams
  /-- The descriptor IS the canonical real config (not an arbitrary parameterization). -/
  params_are_real : params = babyBearD4W16
  /-- The SOLE crypto carrier: CR of the real Poseidon2 sponge. -/

/-- From a realized bundle, recover the bare CR carrier (so all existing derivations fire unchanged
while the parameter correspondence rides along). -/

/-! ## §2 — `compressNInjective` IS Poseidon2 CR (the load-bearing frame portal). -/

/-- **`compressNInjective_iff_poseidon2CR`** — the frame-sponge injectivity portal
`compressNInjective compressN` is DEFINITIONALLY the Poseidon2 CR assumption on the same sponge:
both say `∀ xs ys, compressN xs = compressN ys → xs = ys`. So grounding the frame portal needs NO
encoder and NO extra hypothesis — it IS collision-resistance of the list-hash. -/
theorem compressNInjective_iff_poseidon2CR (compressN : List ℤ → ℤ) :
    compressNInjective compressN ↔ Poseidon2SpongeCR compressN := Iff.rfl

/-- **`compressNInjective_of_poseidon2CR`** — discharge `compressNInjective` from Poseidon2 CR. The
proved bridge: the abstract frame-sponge injectivity portal the tower carries is exactly the CR of
the in-circuit Poseidon2 sponge (`Poseidon2Emit.emittedPoseidon2Compress`, faithful by
`emit_faithful_poseidon2_compress`). -/
theorem compressNInjective_of_poseidon2CR {compressN : List ℤ → ℤ}
    (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR compressN) : compressNInjective compressN := hCR

/-! ## §3 — leaf / log injectivity: CR ∘ injective-encoder.

A Poseidon2 leaf/log hash applies the sponge to a *structured* input via a canonical serialization.
We package that factoring as a realization bundle. Encoder-injectivity is a STRUCTURAL field (a
canonical serialization is provably injective — NOT a crypto assumption); `spongeCR` is the SOLE
crypto carrier, shared with the frame portal above. -/

/-- **`LeafRealization CH`** — `CH` is a Poseidon2-realized leaf hash: there is a serialization
`encodeLeaf : CellId → Value → List ℤ`, INJECTIVE in the `Value` at each fixed cell, such that
`CH c v = sponge (encodeLeaf c v)`, and `sponge` is collision-resistant. (The `sponge` here is the
SAME Poseidon2 sponge as the frame `compressN`; we let it be a field so a realization may reuse one
global sponge.) -/
structure LeafRealization (CH : CellId → Value → ℤ) where
  /-- The Poseidon2 sponge the leaf hash squeezes through. -/
  sponge : List ℤ → ℤ
  /-- The canonical serialization of a cell's `(id, value)` to field elements. -/
  encodeLeaf : CellId → Value → List ℤ
  /-- STRUCTURAL (not crypto): the serialization is injective in the `Value` at a fixed cell. A
  canonical encoding is provably injective; the `Reference` instance exhibits one. -/
  encodeLeaf_inj : ∀ (c : CellId) (v w : Value), encodeLeaf c v = encodeLeaf c w → v = w
  /-- The leaf hash factors as `sponge ∘ encodeLeaf`. -/

/-- **`cellLeafInjective_of_realization`** — discharge `cellLeafInjective CH` from a Poseidon2 leaf
realization. PROVED by composing CR of the sponge with injectivity of the serialization:
`CH c v = CH c w` ⇒ `sponge (enc c v) = sponge (enc c w)` ⇒[CR] `enc c v = enc c w` ⇒[enc inj]
`v = w`. The only crypto content is `R.spongeCR`. -/

  intro c v w h
  rw [R.factor c v, R.factor c w] at h
  exact R.encodeLeaf_inj c v w (R.spongeCR _ _ h)

/-- **`LogRealization LH`** — `LH` is a Poseidon2-realized receipt-chain hash: an INJECTIVE
serialization `encodeLog : List Turn → List ℤ`, with `LH xs = sponge (encodeLog xs)` and `sponge`
collision-resistant. Same shape as `LeafRealization`, over the growing-log domain. -/
structure LogRealization (LH : List Turn → ℤ) where
  /-- The Poseidon2 sponge the log hash squeezes through. -/
  sponge : List ℤ → ℤ
  /-- The canonical serialization of a turn list to field elements. -/

realization. PROVED by composing CR of the sponge with injectivity of the serialization. -/

  exact R.encodeLog_inj xs ys (R.spongeCR _ _ h)

/-! ## §4 — non-vacuity witnesses: REAL realizations whose CR sponge is injective.

These exhibit injective serializations + an injective (toy) sponge, so each derivation
above FIRES on a concrete instance — proving the bundles are inhabitable and the theorems
non-vacuous. (Real Poseidon2 leaves CR as the standing obligation; here we discharge it with a
provably-injective stand-in, exactly as `PortalFloor.Reference` does.) -/

/-! ## §4½ — THE EXTRACTION-AS-DATA SPINE: the sound replacement for the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor.

`Poseidon2SpongeCR` above is FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so a keystone that CARRIES it as a hypothesis
says nothing about the deployed system. This section supplies what such a keystone should conclude
instead: a TOTAL extractor that, from an equivocation on a GROUP-4 sponge absorption, either proves
the absorbed blocks equal or HANDS BACK the specific pair of lists at which the deployed sponge
actually collides.

Note what `SpongeColl` is NOT: it is not `∃ xs ys, sponge-collides xs ys`, which pigeonhole makes
unconditionally TRUE at deployed parameters and which therefore binds nothing. It is a predicate about
the SPECIFIC pair the extractor RETURNS, and it is REFUTABLE (`spongeColl_refutable_of_injective`).
This is the `CapMerkleGeneric.NodeColl` / `EffectVmEmitRotationR.WireColl` shape at the sponge. -/

/-- **`SpongeColl hash p`** — the SPECIFIC pair of lists `p` is a GENUINE collision of the sponge:
DISTINCT inputs with the SAME digest. The named disjunct every cured keystone carries in place of the
deleted injectivity floor. -/
def SpongeColl (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (p : List ℤ × List ℤ) : Prop :=
  p.1 ≠ p.2 ∧ hash p.1 = hash p.2

/-- "Is this pair a genuine collision?" is DECIDABLE, so the extractor may branch on it and remain a
TOTAL function with no `Classical.choice` in the walk. -/

/-- **⚑ THE GROUP-4 EXTRACTOR.** The deployed wide commitment is one `H4`-of-`H4`: three inner blocks
`A/B/C` are sponged, and their digests plus a side-table carrier `d` form the outer 4-list. Given two
such absorptions with EQUAL outer digests, locate where they break: if the two outer 4-lists differ
they ARE the collision; otherwise the outer lists agree slot-for-slot, so each inner digest pair
agrees and the FIRST inner block pair that differs is the collision. If nothing differs the spec
delivers equality outright and the returned value is never read (a trivially non-colliding pair). -/

/-! ### Strength bridges — BOTH ways, standalone, deliberately NOT hypotheses on any keystone. -/

/-- **⚑ THE NO-STRENGTH-LOST TOOTH.** Under exactly the injectivity the deleted floor asserted, the
collision disjunct is impossible and the plain equality falls straight out — so every theorem that used
to carry `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is EXACTLY the injective special case of its cured form. Nothing that was
genuinely proved has been given up; what was given up is the pretence that the deployed sponge
satisfies the hypothesis. Stated standalone: a keystone carrying `Poseidon2SpongeCR` would be right
back where this repair started. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE, so the disjunction is not a free pass.)** At an
injective sponge no returned pair is a collision, so a cured keystone cannot discharge itself by taking
the right branch: the binding half has to do the work. A disjunction whose right side were always
available would carry no more content than `True` — which is precisely the free pass an
`∃ collision` formulation would have handed over. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the collision branch is REACHABLE.)** A degenerate sponge genuinely collides at a pair,
so `SpongeColl` is not accidentally empty either. Both branches of every cured disjunction are live
across sponges — which is what makes the disjunction informative rather than a disguised equality. -/
