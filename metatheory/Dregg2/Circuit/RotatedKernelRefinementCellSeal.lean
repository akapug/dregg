# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementCellSeal — the PRINCIPLED-FIX VALUE-leg circuit→kernel
  refinement for `cellSeal`, against a descriptor that FORCES the `lifecycle` write into a COMMITTED
  column (the lifecycle-root system-root limb).

## The gap this closes (cellSeal's genuinely-FALSE VALUE rung)

`incrementNonce`/`setField` discharge their VALUE rung because a LIVE deployed gate (`gNonce` /
`gFieldWrite`) PINS a column that lands in the published `state_commit`. `cellSeal` is the FIRST of the
~17 VALUE_MISSING effects: its kernel write is `lifecycle := lifecycle[cell ↦ Sealed]`, a kernel-owned
SIDE-TABLE. The deployed circuit's per-cell commitment is
`hash(balance_lo, balance_hi, nonce, field[0..7], cap_root)` (`circuit/src/effect_vm/cell_state.rs::compute_commitment`)
— it binds NO lifecycle column. The live rotated `cellSealVmDescriptor2R24` FREEZES the economic block
and ticks the nonce; the lifecycle flip is OFF-ROW (`EffectVmEmitCellSeal.cellSeal_offrow_unenforced`).
So a `cellSeal_descriptorRefines` against the DEPLOYED descriptor is genuinely FALSE: a prover can
publish a commitment to an UN-SEALED post and the circuit cannot tell.

The Lean apex `recStateCommit = cmb(cellDigest, RH)` ALREADY assumes the rest hash `RH` binds the full
kernel INCLUDING `lifecycle` (`StateCommit.RestHashIffFrame`, `StateCommit.lean:229`). The deployed
circuit just does not REALIZE that binding. This module builds the FIX that does — additively, on a NEW
committed lifecycle-root column — and discharges the VALUE rung against it.

## The binding mechanism (chosen: a dedicated `lifecycle` system-root limb)

`Exec.SystemRoots` already gives the kernel side-tables their OWN committed home: `systemRootsDigest`
is absorbed into the cell commitment by `cellCommitS`, and `cellCommitS_binds_systemRoots` proves a
fixed commitment pins every side-table root (`SystemRoots.lean:191`). `lifecycle` is exactly such a
kernel-owned side-table. We model its committed root — `lifecycleRoot` — the SAME way the side-table
roots are modelled (a `ListCommit.listDigest` over the entry, binding via the realizable
`compressNInjective` Poseidon-CR carrier), absorbed as ONE more committed limb.

> ADDITIVITY NOTE. The shared `Exec.SystemRoots` block is `N_SYSTEM_ROOTS = 8`, indices 0..7 all
> assigned (ESCROW..SEALED_BOXES), and mirrors the Rust `[FieldElement; 8]` — bumping it to a 9th
> LIFECYCLE index would mutate a def imported by ~45 modules AND the Rust array layout, i.e. NOT
> additive. So the lifecycle root is modelled here as its OWN dedicated committed limb, reusing the
> `listDigest`/`compressNInjective` carrier `SystemRoots`/`ListCommit` already use, NOT by mutating
> `N_SYSTEM_ROOTS`. The Rust realization (§Deliverable in the report) is the same either way: the
> per-cell commitment must absorb a `lifecycle_root` limb and the cellSeal trace-fill must emit the
> sealed-lifecycle root.

## The FIX descriptor + the proof

  * `lifecycleRoot` — the committed digest of the cell's `lifecycle` entry (the new committed column).
  * `gLifecycleSeal` — the FIX gate that FORCES the post lifecycle-root column to
    `lifecycleRoot (lifecycle[cell ↦ Sealed])`, exactly mirroring how `gFieldWrite slot` forces
    `fields[slot]_after = param1` into a committed column.
  * `lifecycleSealForced` — the gate's faithfulness: it holds IFF the post lifecycle-root IS the sealed
    digest. So a satisfying FIX witness PINS the committed lifecycle column to the Sealed value.
  * `cellSealGenuineEncodes` — the active-row⟷kernel decode, carrying the kernel-only residual (the
    whole-map `sealLifecycleMap`, the `CellSealGuard`, the 16-field frame, the receipt log) and tying
    the FORCED lifecycle root to `lifecycle[cell ↦ Sealed]` via the digest injectivity, exactly as
    setField's `rotatedEncodesSF` ties `param1 = v`.
  * `cellSeal_descriptorRefines` — a satisfying FIX-descriptor witness + decode ⟹ `CellSealSpec`: the
    `lifecycle := Sealed` write is FORCED via the committed lifecycle root, the rest of the frame is
    the NAMED decode residual.
  * `cellSeal_descriptorRefines_rejects_unsealed` (BOTH-POLARITY TOOTH) — a witness whose post
    lifecycle is NOT `[cell ↦ Sealed]` is UNSAT (the lifecycle-root gate bites). This is what the
    deployed circuit CANNOT do and the FIX does.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, lifecycleLeafInjective-style CR carrier} on
every new theorem. The ONLY carried crypto assumption is the realizable Poseidon CR
(`compressNInjective` + an injective lifecycle leaf) — the SAME carrier `SystemRoots`/`ListCommit`
already use, never a fresh axiom. No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no `native_decide`. NEW file; imports are
read-only.

/-! ## §0 — the committed `lifecycle`-root column.

The lifecycle side-table is `lifecycle : CellId → Nat`. Its committed root over the touched `cell` is
the `listDigest` of the cell's entry — a `FieldElem` the circuit carries, EXACTLY like a `system_roots`
limb. `lifecycleRoot k cell` is the value the FIX descriptor's lifecycle-root column carries for a
kernel `k`; the gate forces the POST column to `lifecycleRoot` of the SEALED kernel. -/

/-- A field element (the same `ℤ`-carrier `ListCommit`/`StateCommit`/`SystemRoots` use for a felt). -/
abbrev FieldElem := ℤ

/-- The injective leaf encoder for a lifecycle entry: the entry value as a felt. Carried injective
(`lifecycleLeafInjective`), exactly as `SystemRoots`/`ListCommit` carry their leaf injectivity — a
realizable Poseidon over a canonical per-entry serialization, NEVER a Lean axiom. -/
def lifecycleLeaf : Nat → FieldElem := fun n => (n : ℤ)

/-- The lifecycle leaf encoder is injective (the realizable Poseidon-CR carrier). REALIZABLE: `Nat.cast`
into `ℤ` is literally injective, so the toy instance discharges it cleanly. -/

/-- **`lifecycleRoot compressN k cell`** — the committed root of cell `cell`'s `lifecycle` entry: the
`listDigest` over `[lifecycle cell]`. The Lean mirror of the Rust `lifecycle_root` limb the FIX adds to
`compute_commitment`. A pure function of the entry value; absorbed into `state_commit` exactly as a
`system_roots` digest is (`SystemRoots.cellCommitS`). -/

value. Off the realizable `compressN`-injectivity carrier + the injective leaf: the digest binds the
one-element entry list, so the entry value is pinned. This is the `systemRootsDigest_binds` shape for
the lifecycle side-table — the anti-ghost foundation a forged un-sealed post must clear. -/

/-! ## §1 — the FIX descriptor's lifecycle-root gate (the column-forcing gate).

The deployed cellSeal row freezes the economic block + ticks the nonce; the FIX ADDS a committed
lifecycle-root column whose POST value the gate `gLifecycleSeal` PINS to the SEALED digest. We model the
gate semantically as a predicate on a row's pre/post lifecycle-root columns — at the same granularity
the per-effect VALUE rungs use (`gFieldWrite` pins `fields[slot]_after = param1`). -/

/-- **`LifecycleRootRow compressN preK postK cell preRoot postRoot`** — the decode tying the FIX row's
two committed lifecycle-root columns to the kernel pre/post lifecycle of `cell`. The PRE column is
`lifecycleRoot` of the pre kernel; the POST column is `lifecycleRoot` of the post kernel. This is the
`RowEncodesSeal`-analog for the new committed column. -/
def LifecycleRootRow (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem)
    (preK postK : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (preRoot postRoot : FieldElem) : Prop :=
  preRoot = lifecycleRoot compressN preK cell ∧ postRoot = lifecycleRoot compressN postK cell

/-- **`gLifecycleSeal compressN preK cell postRoot`** — the FIX gate body: the POST lifecycle-root
column IS the digest of the SEALED kernel's `cell` entry. The committed-column analog of
`gFieldWriteP1 slot`: the deployed circuit would EVALUATE this against the sealed-lifecycle root the
trace-fill emits, so a row whose post lifecycle-root is anything else fails the gate. -/
def gLifecycleSeal (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem)
    (preK : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (postRoot : FieldElem) : Prop :=
  postRoot = lifecycleRoot compressN (setLifecycle preK cell lcSealed) cell

/-- **`lifecycleSealForced` — the FIX gate FORCES the committed lifecycle column.** If the FIX gate
holds, the POST lifecycle-root column IS the sealed digest. So under `LifecycleRootRow`, the post
kernel's lifecycle of `cell` is pinned to `lcSealed` (via `lifecycleRoot_binds`). This is the rung the
deployed circuit is MISSING and the FIX supplies — exactly `setField_value_forced` for the new column. -/

/-! ## §2 — the WHOLE-MAP forcing: the post lifecycle MAP IS `sealLifecycleMap`.

`CellSealSpec` requires `s'.kernel.lifecycle = sealLifecycleMap s.kernel cell` — the WHOLE map, not just
the `cell` entry. The committed lifecycle root pins the `cell` entry (forced above); the OTHER cells'
entries are FROZEN, carried as the decode residual `hframeOther` (the off-`cell` lifecycle entries are
unchanged — a whole-map residual the per-cell committed column cannot witness, exactly as setField's
`hcellMove` carries the off-slot map). Together they reconstruct the whole map. -/

/-- **`lifecycleMapForced` — the post lifecycle MAP is the seal map.** From the FORCED `cell` entry
(`= lcSealed`) AND the off-`cell` freeze residual, the whole post lifecycle map equals
`sealLifecycleMap preK cell`. The committed root forces the touched entry; the frame carries the rest. -/

/-! ## §3 — `cellSealGenuineEncodes`: the FIX active-row ⟷ kernel decode.

`cellSealGenuineEncodes pre post actor cell` ties a satisfying FIX-descriptor witness's lifecycle-root
columns onto the kernel seal boundary, and carries the residual the per-cell circuit cannot witness:

  * `preRoot`/`postRoot` + `LifecycleRootRow` — the two committed lifecycle-root columns this state
    encodes (the new committed column the FIX adds);
  * `gate` — the FIX lifecycle gate holds on the row (the WITNESS leg — the committed lifecycle-root is
    PINNED to the sealed digest by the running FIX circuit, not asserted by the decode);
  * `frameOther` — the off-`cell` lifecycle entries are FROZEN (the WHOLE-MAP residual the per-cell
    column cannot carry);
  * `guard` — the `CellSealGuard` (self-authority + is-Live); the executor's domain restriction;
  * `logAdv` — the self-targeted receipt-log advance (off the per-row block);
  * `fr*` — the 16 non-`lifecycle` kernel frame fields (the full `CellSealSpec` frame residual). NAMED,
    not laundered. -/

/-- The decode relating a satisfying FIX cellSeal witness's row to a kernel `pre → post` seal of `cell`
by `actor`. DATA-bearing (`Type`, like setField's `rotatedEncodesSF`): it exhibits the two committed
lifecycle-root columns, carries the FIX gate (the witness leg) + the off-map frame + the kernel-side
residual. -/

/-! ## §4 — the apex obligation: the FIX circuit FORCES the seal write.

column to the sealed digest, and `lifecycleMapForced` lifts that to the whole post map. -/

/-- **`cellSeal_lifecycle_forced` — the committed lifecycle write is FIX-CIRCUIT-FORCED.** On the decoded
row the FIX lifecycle gate forces the whole post lifecycle map to `sealLifecycleMap pre.kernel cell`. So
the seal is pinned by the running FIX circuit; a decode claiming an un-sealed / wrong post is UNSAT
(the §6 tooth). This is precisely the rung the DEPLOYED circuit is missing. -/

The decode carries the kernel-only residual (the guard, the frame, the log); the WITNESS forces the
seal write. We assemble `CellSealSpec`. -/

/-- **`cellSeal_descriptorRefines` — THE FIX CIRCUIT→KERNEL REFINEMENT for cellSeal.** A satisfying FIX
cellSeal descriptor witness (carried as `cellSealGenuineEncodes`, whose `gate` is the FIX lifecycle-root
gate the running circuit pins) forces the KERNEL's seal step `CellSealSpec pre actor cell post` — the
`.cellSealA` arm of `execFullA`. The `lifecycle := Sealed` write is FORCED via the committed lifecycle
root (`cellSeal_lifecycle_forced`, riding the new in-commitment lifecycle column); the guard, the
16-field frame, and the log are the named decode residual. -/

/-! ## §6 — BOTH-POLARITY TOOTH: an un-sealed witness is UNSAT.

The refinement is meaningful only if the FIX circuit truly forces the seal. The converse: a decode that
claims a post lifecycle whose `cell` entry is NOT `lcSealed` (a frozen / wrong lifecycle, the deployed
circuit's blind spot) cannot ride a satisfying FIX witness — the lifecycle-root gate FORCES the sealed
digest, so the claim is contradictory. This is EXACTLY what the deployed circuit cannot reject. -/

/-- **`cellSeal_descriptorRefines_rejects_unsealed` — the lifecycle tooth.** If a decode asserts a post
whose `cell` lifecycle is NOT `lcSealed` (e.g. a frozen-lifecycle trace — the deployed convention), then
NO FIX witness realizes that decode: the assumption is `False`. The FIX lifecycle-root gate pins the
seal, so an un-sealed cellSeal is UNSAT. -/

/-! ## §6.5 — CLASS A: the seal is FORCED by the DEPLOYED descriptor `cellSealV3` (not a modelled gate).

§1–§6 force the seal from `cellSealGenuineEncodes.gate`, the MODELLED `gLifecycleSeal`. That gate is a
property the decode ASSERTS — editing the LIVE `cellSealV3` constraints does NOT break it. This section
closes that gap: `cellSeal_forced` derives `post.kernel.lifecycle cell = lcSealed` from a `Satisfied2 hash
cellSealV3` witness DIRECTLY, by

  * `graduateV1_sound` — lift the v2 `Satisfied2` of `cellSealV3 = graduateV1 (rotateV3WithDiscGate …)` to
    the v1 per-row `satisfiedVm` of the underlying disc-gated descriptor (the chip/range table side
    `RotTableSide` discharges its `hchip`/`hrange`, `graduable` by `decide`);
  * `cellSealV3_disc_forces_sealed` — the DEPLOYED in-circuit disc gate FORCES the committed AFTER disc
    TRACE limb (`afterDiscCol`, `B_DISC = 32`, a pre-iroot committed limb chaining into `state_commit`) to
    `discSealed (= 1)` on the active row;
  * `CellSealTraceReadout.discLimbDecodes` — the realizable `WitnessDecodes`-class seam: the committed disc
    limb IS the post kernel's lifecycle discriminant cast to ℤ (`= (post.kernel.lifecycle cell : ℤ)`). The
    deployed trace-fill emits the `u8` discriminant of `post.lifecycle[cell]` into exactly that limb, so the
    two are the SAME committed felt by construction — the analog of transfer's `TransferTraceReadout` row
    reads (the limb-level decode the COMMITMENT does not certify, supplied by `StarkSound`).

Editing `cellSealV3`'s disc gate breaks `cellSealV3_disc_forces_sealed`, hence `cellSeal_forced`, hence
`cellSeal_descriptorRefines` — Class A. The seam is a NAMED realizable carrier (a structure field), never a
`sorry`: it is `#assert_axioms`-clean, the `WitnessDecodes`-class floor transfer carries too. -/

/-- **`CellSealTraceReadout` — the realizable circuit-witness extraction for cellSeal (NAMED).**
The trace-determined part a satisfying `cellSealV3` witness supplies, EXACTLY the `WitnessDecodes` class of
transfer's `TransferTraceReadout`: the prover's designated ACTIVE cellSeal row + its selector fact + the
realizable disc-limb decode (the committed AFTER disc limb IS the post lifecycle discriminant felt) + the
whole-map / guard / log / 16-field residual the per-cell committed column cannot witness. Data-bearing

A `Satisfied2 hash cellSealV3` witness (with the chip/range table side `RotTableSide`) plus the realizable
`CellSealTraceReadout` forces `post.kernel.lifecycle cell = lcSealed`. The committed AFTER disc limb is
pinned to `discSealed (= 1)` by the LIVE disc gate (`cellSealV3_disc_forces_sealed`, via `graduateV1_sound`
on the active transition row), and the readout's `discLimbDecodes` identifies that limb with the post
lifecycle discriminant — so the discriminant is `1 = lcSealed`. The analog of transfer's `debit_forced` /
incrementNonce's `incNonce_nonce_forced`: the forced fact rides the DEPLOYED constraints, so editing
`cellSealV3`'s disc gate turns this RED. -/
