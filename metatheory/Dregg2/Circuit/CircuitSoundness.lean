# Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundness — the APEX light-client unfoolability theorem.

This module is the **architectural backbone** of dregg's circuit-soundness story: it states, as a
green Lean skeleton, the exact shape a verifying light client gets for free, and it carries the
genuine remaining obligations as EXPLICIT hypotheses / typeclasses — never as an open hole, `:= True`,
or a silent default.

## The target (what soundness means)

A light client verifies a rotated batch proof against the live VK and runs NOTHING else. Soundness:

  `verifyBatch vk pi π = accept  ⟹  ∃ a genuine kernel transition  s ⟶ s'  with
                                     pi.pre = stateCommit s  ∧  pi.post = stateCommit s'`.

The "genuine kernel transition" is the proved declarative kernel `ActionDispatch.fullActionStep`
(`⟺ execFullA` by `fullActionStep_exec_iff`), composed over a turn by `turnSpec`
(`⟺ execFullTurnA` by `execFullTurnA_iff_turnSpec`). The live circuit is `Satisfied2 hash d …` over
`EffectVmDescriptor2`, with descriptors drawn from the v3 registry
(`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.v3Registry`). The whole point of THIS module is to connect `Satisfied2` to
`turnSpec fullActionStep` faithfully.

## The three pieces (the prompt's mandate)

1. `StateDecode` — the FAITHFUL witness→kernel-state decode. It says the witness's PUBLISHED pre/post
   commitments equal `recStateCommit` of the kernel states they bind, over a fixed commitment surface
   (`CommitSurface`), and that those kernels are `AccountsWF`. Faithfulness is NOT assumed: it is a
   THEOREM (`stateDecode_pre_faithful` / `stateDecode_post_faithful`) — two states decoding the SAME
   published commitment have EQUAL kernels, by `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` (the named Poseidon CR
   set + the PROVED-preserved `AccountsWF`). It assumes NO kernel admissibility (no authority, no
   frame): the decode pins the kernel from the commitment alone.

   The cross-cell / cross-step FRAME is NOT a free field. A `StateDecodeChain` decodes a whole turn
   step-by-step, each step publishing its old/new commitment; `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`
   DERIVES that consecutive kernels coincide (`postᵢ = preᵢ₊₁`) from the published-commitment binding,
   so the frame is a CONSEQUENCE of the commitments, not an assumption.

2. `descriptorRefines d kstep` — the per-effect rung each effect discharges: any `Satisfied2` witness
   of descriptor `d` whose published commitments decode to `pre`/`post` forces `kstep pre post`. This
   is the genuine obligation per effect; this module CARRIES it (the registry-wide version is a
   hypothesis of the apex), it does not fake it.

3. `lightclient_unfoolable` — the apex. From a verifying batch (`verifyBatch vk pi π = accept`), the VK
   bound to the live registry (`vk = vkOfRegistry liveRegistry`), the named STARK-batch soundness
   carrier `[StarkSound]`, the named hash CR carrier `[Poseidon2SpongeCR]`, and the carried per-effect
   obligation, conclude a genuine kernel turn whose endpoints are the published commitments.

## Carried obligations ledger (every named-and-deferred premise; nothing laundered)

  * `[StarkSound vk pi π]` — the audited p3 batch-STARK soundness: `verifyBatch vk pi π = accept`
    yields, for the descriptor named in `pi`, a `Satisfied2` witness `t` whose published PI agree with
    `pi`. This is a REALIZABLE crypto/audit obligation (the FRI/p3 verify⟹∃witness extraction) that
    cannot be proved in Lean; it is introduced HERE as a clean named class, not assumed silently. The
    minimal honest interface (`StarkSound`, `verifyBatch`, `accept`, `vkOfRegistry`) is DEFINED in
    this module because none existed.

  * `[Poseidon2SpongeCR hash]` — Poseidon2-sponge collision-resistance (the existing carrier from
    `Poseidon2Binding`). The faithfulness of the decode rides on it (via `wireCommitR_binds` /
    `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`). REALIZABLE.

  * ⚰ the `CommitSurface` CR fields (`compressInjective cmb/compress`, `compressNInjective
    compressN`, `cellLeafInjective CH`) — GONE 2026-08-01. They were listed here as "REALIZABLE;
    bundled, not free"; they are not realizable, they are REFUTED at deployed BabyBear width by
    pigeonhole, and the bundle that carried them had no deployed inhabitant. The binding they
    justified is now `CommitSurface.commit_binds_of_noColl`, whose residual names the argument pairs
    instead of assuming there is none. The surviving field is `restFrame : RestHashIffFrameFin RH`,
    which IS satisfiable.

  * `hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines (liveRegistry e) (fullActionStep-arm e)` — the per-effect
    refinement, CARRIED as an apex hypothesis. This is the rung the rest of the campaign discharges
    (one effect at a time) into `lightclient_unfoolable`. It is the genuine remaining work, named.

  * `WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` — the WITNESS→KERNEL-STATE EXISTENCE rung. A light client has only
    `(pi, π)`; it cannot supply `pre`/`post`. The hard fact is that the witness's published
    commitments are commitments of REAL well-formed kernel states — i.e. that SOME `pre`/`post` exist
    decoding `pi.toPublished`. This is the genuine surjectivity/realizability of the commitment surface
    on the published values a verifying witness pins; it CANNOT be proved by assuming the conclusion,
    so it is CARRIED explicitly (exactly like `StarkSound`), and the apex DERIVES the decode from it
    rather than hypothesizing a free `pre`/`post`/`hdecode`. REALIZABLE (every accepted trace's
    published roots ARE `recStateCommit` of the kernels the prover committed); named, not faked.

DERIVED (NOT carried — proved here from the above): the frame continuity over a chain
(`stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`, in REDUCTION FORM since 2026-08-01) and the apex composition
shape. The decode's faithfulness moved out: `stateDecode_*_faithful` are DELETED (they rode the
vacuous `commit_binds`); their floor-free twins are
`StateCommitReduce.stateDecode_pre/post_faithful_orBreak`.

`CommitSurface` packages the five abstract commitment primitives `recStateCommit` is parametric in
(`CH RH cmb compress compressN`) together with the STANDARD Poseidon collision-resistance facts the
full-state-root binding needs. These are SECTION PARAMETERS in `StateCommit`, never axioms; bundling
them lets the apex carry "the surface is collision-resistant" as ONE named hypothesis. Each field is
REALIZABLE by a real Poseidon. -/

/-- A commitment surface for the full kernel state: the five primitives `recStateCommit` runs over,
plus the finite-support rest-frame obligation.

⚰ **FOUR INJECTIVITY FIELDS DELETED 2026-08-01** — `cmbInj : compressInjective cmb`,
`compInj : compressInjective compress`, `compNInj : compressNInjective compressN`,
`leafInj : cellLeafInjective CH`. Each asserts that a COMPRESSING map into ONE BabyBear felt is
injective, which pigeonhole REFUTES at deployed parameters
(`Verify.ApexPremiseVacuity.apexCommitFloorSansRest_false_at_babyBear`) — so no deployed surface ever inhabited the bundle and
EVERYTHING quantified over `S : CommitSurface` and conditioned on them was VACUOUSLY TRUE.

The only consumers that read them AS INJECTIVITY were `CommitSurface.commit_binds` (deleted; use
`commit_binds_of_noColl`), `StateCommitReduce.surface_no_stateBreak` (deleted with its two dependents),
and `FinInjectivityCollapse.injectivity_collapses_to_poseidon2CR` (retired — its target
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` is refuted at the same width). Every other mention was a CONSTRUCTOR filling
them.

⛑ THE BINDER SURFACE FOLLOWED, 2026-08-02. Deleting these fields left `ClosureSurface.S_live` with
four `_`-prefixed parameters ITS BODY IGNORED, so ~150 declarations were inapplicable at deployed
parameters and every binder that only existed to feed them are DELETED. The "one place a proof
genuinely READ one" (the setProgram rung) was recorded that day and is FALSE — the rung passed the
hypothesis to a lemma whose body never used it, `RotatedKernelRefinementProgram` having shed it on
2026-07-30 — so the `ClosureReadouts.hNProgram` field it was parked in is deleted too (2026-08-03).
All four were inert at every site. See `Verify.ClosureSurfaceApplicable` for the closed surface that
buys, and `Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureSurface.lean`'s `S_live` for the measurement.

⚠ The surviving `restFrame` field is the finite-support successor `RestHashIffFrameFin`, which IS
satisfiable — at the UNBOUNDED reference sponge, and NOT at deployed BabyBear width, where the same
pigeonhole that killed the four kills it too
(`Verify.RestFrameFiniteSupportSuccessor.restHashIffFrameFin_false_babyBear`, 2026-08-02). So this
structure still has no deployed inhabitant, and — because its body is `Iff`-headed and
`#floor_ratchet`'s floor derivation requires an injectivity SHAPE — NO GATE SAYS SO. See its own doc
below. -/

  /-- the per-cell leaf hash. -/

  ⚑ **This field was `RestHashIffFrame RH` until 2026-07-31, and that made the whole bundle
  UNINHABITED AT EVERY PARAMETER** (`RestFrameCardinalityFloor.restHashIffFrame_false_by_cardinality`
  refutes it for every `RH` by Cantor on `bal : CellId → AssetId → ℤ`), so every theorem quantifying
  over a `CommitSurface` was vacuous and could not even be given a refutability pole. The
  finite-support successor `RestFrameFin.RestHashIffFrameFin` restricts the biconditional to the
  `denote`-image of `FinKernelState` and IS satisfiable — see
  a closed inhabitant of this whole structure. ⚑ CORRECTED: this cited
  `Circuit.CommitSurfaceInhabited.refCommitSurface`, WHICH DOES NOT EXIST — no such module, no such
  declaration. The real inhabitant is the deliberately ANONYMOUS `noncomputable example :
  CommitSurface` at `Verify/RestFrameFiniteSupportSuccessor.lean:348`, left unnamed on purpose
  because naming it mints a `bundle-user` carrier in the floor ratchet (that file's §6). -/

/-! ### The faithfulness engine, in REDUCTION FORM.

⚰ **`CommitSurface.commit_binds` is DELETED (2026-08-01).** It said: two `AccountsWF`,
finitely-representable kernels whose surface commitments agree at the same turn are EQUAL. It proved
that by feeding `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` the four injectivity FIELDS
`S.cmbInj`/`S.compInj`/`S.compNInj`/`S.leafInj` — every one of which is FALSE at deployed
parameters, because injectivity of a compressing map into ONE BabyBear felt is refuted by pigeonhole
(`Verify.ApexPremiseVacuity.apexCommitFloorSansRest_false_at_babyBear`). So the theorem, and everything conditioned on it, was
VACUOUSLY TRUE; the four fields are deleted from the structure in the same commit.

⚰ **`CommitSurface.commit_binds_orBreak` IS ALSO DELETED (2026-08-01, same day, second pass).** It
was the first replacement: `OrBreak S.StateBreak (k = k')` — the kernels are equal, OR the adversary
exhibited a collision of one of `S`'s four hash carriers. It consumed no injectivity, so it was TRUE
at the deployed hash — and that is all it was. `S.StateBreak`'s first disjunct is
`SpongeCollision S.compressN`, a GLOBAL existential, and
`SpongeCollisionShirk.spongeCollision_of_fieldBounded` supplies it at ANY sponge landing in a BabyBear
felt. So the break branch held UNCONDITIONALLY at deployed parameters, the dichotomy was literally
`True` (`StateCommitReduce.orBreak_stateBreakP_iff_True`, stated over an ARBITRARY good branch), and
the good branch carried nothing. The same pigeonhole that REFUTES the injectivity floor ESTABLISHES
the break: the first pass traded vacuous-by-false-hypothesis for vacuous-by-free-disjunct.

`commit_binds_of_noColl` below is the replacement that discriminates. It carries the per-instance
residual `S.CommitColl k k' t` — the four-way collision event stated at the SPECIFIC argument pairs
the extraction visits, never as `∃ two colliding inputs` — which is SATISFIABLE at an honest hash,
REFUTABLE at a broken one, and NOT PROVABLE
(`StateCommitLeafRegrounded.noRecStateCommitColl_diag` / `recStateCommitColl_refutable` /
`noRecStateCommitColl_not_provable`). `StateCommitReduce.perInstance_sharper_than_stateBreakP` is the
separation: at ONE AND THE SAME deployed-shaped sponge the disjunctive form holds with good branch
`False` while the per-instance residual is genuinely refuted at the honest pair.

⚠ Do NOT reintroduce a `¬ S.StateBreak`-hypothesised twin either. `¬ StateBreak S` is false at
deployed width for exactly the pigeonhole reason the four fields are, so hypothesising it is the same
vacuity under a third name — which is why `StateCommitReduce.commit_binds_of_no_stateBreak` was
deleted alongside. The per-instance residual is NOT that: it names a pair. -/

/-- **The state-commit apex break at a surface's carriers**: a concrete collision of `S`'s sponge,
root combiner, node hash, or cell-leaf hash — the four commitment primitives `recStateCommit` runs
over. Definitionally the raw `StateCommitReduce.StateBreakP` at `S`'s carriers.

⚑ Defined HERE, not in `StateCommitReduce` where it lived until 2026-08-01. This module's OWN
bindings (`stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`, the turn-chain seam teeth) have to state their break
disjunct, and `StateCommitReduce` sits ABOVE this module in the import order. The raw layers moved
DOWN to `StateCommitReduceRaw` for the same reason. -/

all. Cite this, not a doc-comment, when a lane offers an `OrBreak S.StateBreak` re-grounding.

`StateBreak` itself is KEPT: it is the raw break's surface view, out-of-scope threadings
(`HistoryAggregation`, `RecursiveAggregation`, `CommitFaithfulRegrounded`) still state their
conclusions over it, and a refuted def with a visible in-tree refutation is a tombstone with teeth. -/

children, the frame sponge at the two ordered leaf lists, the cell leaf at a named `(cell, v, w)`.

⚑ NOT an existential over all pairs. That distinction is the whole repair: `∃ two colliding inputs` is
supplied by pigeonhole at deployed width and discriminates nothing, while a claim about NAMED points
is refutable at a broken hash and satisfiable at an honest one. Definitionally

`commit_binds` drew, from a per-instance, refutable side condition instead of four refuted
injectivity fields (pass 1) or a free disjunct (pass 2). NO authority gate, NO frame assumption, NO
injectivity carrier.

⚑ `hfin`/`hfin'` (2026-07-31) sit exactly where `hwf`/`hwf'` already sat — a per-call structural
obligation, never a field of the bundle (a bundle of FUNCTIONS has no business quantifying over
STATES). ⚠ `RestFrameFin.not_finiteRepresentable_of_lifecycle_ne_zero` exhibits an `AccountsWF`
kernel OUTSIDE the domain, so the restriction is real. Whether every EXECUTOR-REACHED kernel is
inside it is `FinKernelState.denote_surjective_on_reachable`, still gated on the per-effect commuting
square `hpres`, undischarged for every effect today. -/

/-! **THE UNIFORM BRIDGE — no strength lost, and NO new declaration for it.** The four deleted
injectivity fields, had they been inhabitable, would have killed every `CommitColl` disjunct at every
pair. So each theorem re-grounded on `¬ S.CommitColl` is IMPLIED BY its pre-deletion form: the port is
strictly STRONGER, conclusions unchanged.

⚑ Deliberately NO local `_of_carriers` twin at the surface. `S.CommitColl k k' t` is DEFINITIONALLY
`RecStateCommitColl S.CH S.RH S.cmb S.compress S.compressN k k' t`, so the tree's landed bridge
`StateCommitLeafRegrounded.noRecStateCommitColl_of_carriers hCmb hCompress hCompressN hLeaf` already
has exactly the type `¬ S.CommitColl k k' t` and a not-yet-ported consumer re-points through ONE
application of it. Minting a surface-level restatement would be a BRAND-NEW declaration taking four
refuted floors as hypotheses — a fresh `#floor_ratchet` carrier — for zero content. Reusing the
universal bridge lands this port at a net carrier DECREASE, which is the point of the exercise. -/

/-! ## §2 — `StateDecode`: the FAITHFUL witness→kernel-state decode.

`StateDecode S t pre post` says: the published OLD commitment (`pubPre`) equals the surface commitment
of `pre.kernel`, the published NEW commitment (`pubPost`) equals that of `post.kernel`, both kernels
are `AccountsWF`, and `pre`/`post` carry the turn the commitment is taken at. It DERIVES the kernel
from the commitment via `CommitSurface.commit` — it does NOT assume any kernel admissibility.

`pubPre`/`pubPost` are the witness's PUBLISHED public-input commitments (in the rotated layout, the PI
slots `d.piCount` / `d.piCount + 1` that `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.rotV3_publishes` pins to the row's
chained `wireCommitR` commit; `rotV3_binds_published` makes those PI BIND the decoded limbs under
`Poseidon2SpongeCR`). Here we keep the published commitment ABSTRACT (a single `ℤ` per boundary) — the
faithfulness we prove is exactly that the published commitment determines the kernel; the
limb-level decode (`wireCommitR`/`rotV3_binds_published`) is the per-descriptor bridge that supplies
`pubPre`/`pubPost`, carried by `descriptorRefines`. -/

/-- The published-commitment view of one circuit witness: the OLD and NEW state commitments the trace

/-! ### ⚰ TOMBSTONE — `stateDecode_pre_faithful` / `stateDecode_post_faithful` (DELETED 2026-08-01).

They said: two pre-states (resp. post-states) decoding the SAME published commitment have EQUAL
kernels — the UNIQUENESS half of the decode. Both were one application of
`CommitSurface.commit_binds`, hence conditioned on the four refuted injectivity fields, hence
VACUOUSLY TRUE at deployed parameters (see the tombstone above `CommitSurface.StateBreak`).

CONSUME INSTEAD: `StateCommitReduce.stateDecode_pre_faithful_of_noColl` /
`stateDecode_post_faithful_of_noColl` — the same conclusion, from a per-instance residual at the two
named kernels. (Their `_orBreak` predecessors were themselves vacuous — the break disjunct is free at
deployed width — and are gone too.)

(EXISTENCE of a real transition behind an accepted proof is a separate and floor-free result —
`ApexFloorFree.lightclient_unfoolable_free`. Uniqueness is what these two were about.) -/

/-! ## §3 — `descriptorRefines`: the per-effect rung.

For a descriptor `d` and a candidate kernel step relation `kstep`, `descriptorRefines d kstep` says:
ANY `Satisfied2` witness of `d` whose published commitments (`pc`) decode (via a faithful
`StateDecode`) to `pre`/`post` FORCES `kstep pre post`. This is the obligation each effect discharges
(its `Satisfied2` denotation entails its `fullActionStep` arm); the apex carries the registry-wide
family of these. The hash, surface, and memory boundary (`minit`/`mfin`/`maddrs`) are quantified — a
witness under ANY boundary that publishes commitments decoding to `pre`/`post` must induce the step. -/

/-- **`descriptorRefines d kstep`** — the per-effect refinement obligation: every `Satisfied2` witness
of `d` whose published commitments decode to `pre`/`post` forces `kstep pre post`.

⚑⚑ **THE FLOOR IS IN THE BODY, AND IT IS DEAD. MEASURED 2026-08-01, NOT PORTED.**

The body opens `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash → …` — a floor `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`
PROVES FALSE at deployed BabyBear (infinite `List ℤ` into ~2³¹ values, pigeonhole). Because it sits in the
VALUE and not the signature, **no floor binder appears anywhere in the type of any theorem that mentions
this def**, and every binder-keyed ruler reads those theorems as clean. `DescriptorRefinesShirkRefuted`
proves the consequence outright: `descriptorRefines S hash d (fun _ _ => False)` HOLDS at every
field-bounded sponge. A refinement obligation discharged at an unsatisfiable `kstep` constrains the
circuit in no way at all.

**What the previous version of this docblock claimed, and what is actually true.** It said the antecedent
is "GENUINE — exactly what each effect's discharge needs", citing
`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.rotV3_binds_published`. Measured over the whole tree: `rotV3_binds_published` is
APPLIED NOWHERE — its only non-comment occurrences are its own `theorem` line, its `#assert_axioms`, and a
`FloorRatchetBaseline` row. And not one in-tree discharge of `descriptorRefines` READS the antecedent:

  * `ClosureAll.effectDecodeBridge_of_closedLogExtract` — the funnel every closed-path producer goes
    through (`hrefinesAllClosed` → `ClosureForest.hrefines_forest_closed` → `descriptorRefines_complete`
    and its 31-tag census) — opens `intro _hCR …` and never mentions it again;
  * `WitnessRealizing.descriptorRefines_trivial` drops it;
  * `RotatedKernelRefinementFacetTurnBound.descriptorRefinesTB_to_descriptorRefines` only FORWARDED it
    into `descriptorRefinesTB`, whose body opened with the same dead antecedent — ⚰ BOTH DELETED
    2026-08-02 (tombstone at §6 of that file), which REMOVES this def's last in-tree consumer of the
    antecedent rather than weakening the measurement: the lowering is gone precisely because forwarding a
    live `hCR` into a dead antecedent is plumbing with no reader at either end;
  * the only genuine reads are inside the refuted twin (`DescriptorRefinesReduce.descriptorRefines_of_R`)
    and the refutations themselves.

So the honest replacement here is a **DELETION**, not a re-grounding — the identical finding that carried
the two landed 2026-07-25 prop-body ports (`ClosureAll.ClosedLogExtract`,
`CircuitCompleteness.descriptorComplete`; see `FloorCensus.portedPropBody`). Deleting the antecedent is
strictly STRENGTHENING and needs no bridge lemma.

⚠ **DO NOT re-ground this one on `¬ SpongeColl` at a named pair.** The per-instance residual
(`SpongeCollisionShirk.SpongeColl`, bridge `noSpongeColl_of_spongeCR`) is the right target for a site that
FEEDS the floor a specific pair of lists. This def feeds it nothing. Manufacturing a pair here would mint a
side condition no proof consumes — decoration, and a fresh carrier. Equally, do NOT port onto
`DescriptorRefinesReduce.descriptorRefinesR`: it is `↔`-equivalent to this def
(`descriptorRefinesR_iff_refines`) and provably just as vacuous
(`DescriptorRefinesShirkRefuted.descriptorRefinesR_vacuous_babyBear`).

**The target already exists and already passes the acceptance test:**
`ApexFloorFree.descriptorRefinesFree` — no antecedent, `CommitMap` in place of the (separately refuted)
`CommitSurface` bundle, publication link carried — and
`ApexFloorFree.descriptorRefinesFree_false_at_False_kstep` REFUTES it at `fun _ _ => False`, which is the
falsifier this def and its twin both fail.

**BLAST RADIUS, MEASURED (241 exact-word mentions, 39 files).** 156 are inside comments and carry nothing.
Of the 85 in code: 2 are the census/baseline pins, 4 are `open` lines, and 29 are `hrefines`-family
HYPOTHESIS binders — and every one of those 29 consumers ALSO binds `hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`
explicitly, so the consumer half of the surface is already visible to a binder-keyed census and is not
what this class hides. The silent carriers are the ~21 PRODUCERS (statements that CONCLUDE it with no
floor binder), plus two prop-body aliases that inherit the hiding — `CircuitSoundnessAssembled.EffectDecodeBridge`
(`:= descriptorRefines …`) and the `WitnessRealizing.LeafRefinement.refines` structure FIELD.

**WHY IT IS NOT PORTED HERE, and what the port costs.** The port is one edit to this body plus ~6 producer
proofs; it is NOT a 241-site change. What couples it into a single indivisible commit is the instrument:

  1. `FloorCensus.sentinelPropBody = [descriptorRefines]` and `FloorRatchet` gate (d) BOTH fail closed if
     this def stops being discovered as a prop-body carrier. The port must move the name into
     `FloorCensus.portedPropBody` in the SAME commit, or the whole tree goes red.
  2. `DescriptorRefinesShirkRefuted`'s four refutations become UNPROVABLE the moment the antecedent goes —
     that is the port succeeding, but a falsity theorem may not simply vanish; it has to be retired to a
     tombstone in the same commit, with the acceptance test re-pointed at `descriptorRefinesFree`.
  3. Each of the 29 consumers drops an argument at its `hrefines e hCR …` application sites, and sheds
     `hCR` where nothing else in the proof reads it.

None of the three is a reason to keep the antecedent; they are the work order.

⚑ **RE-MEASURED 2026-08-01 (second pass). The blast-radius numbers hold; two claims around them do
not.** Exact-word count over `metatheory/`, comments AND string literals stripped mechanically:
**245 mentions, 84 in CODE, 161 in comments, 38 files.** The 84 code sites account exactly:

  * **29** `hrefines`-family HYPOTHESIS binders — and checked one at a time, **29/29 also bind
    `hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` explicitly**. (The one that reads as an exception to a
    line-local grep, `Metatheory.Adversary.Schema.circuitDynamics`, is a `noncomputable def` and
    binds it four lines above its `hrefines`.) The consumer half is visible; it is not the hole.
  * **32** in `DescriptorRefinesComplete` — but that is TWO declarations: the alias `def`, and the
    single `descriptorRefines_census`, whose statement is one 31-way conjunction.
  * **4** `open` lines, **1** `FloorCensus.sentinelPropBody` row, **1** this def, **17** producers
    and equations — of which 4 are `DescriptorRefinesShirkRefuted`'s deliberate refutations and 1 is
    `DescriptorRefinesReduce.descriptorRefines_constHash_vacuous`.

**THE ALIAS CHAIN IS THREE DEEP, NOT TWO, AND THE THIRD CARRIES THE CAPSTONES.** Where a grep for
this def's name goes blind:

  * `CircuitSoundnessAssembled.EffectDecodeBridge` — 7 code sites, 4 files.
  * `DescriptorRefinesComplete.DescriptorRefinesComplete`
    (`def … : Prop := ∀ e, descriptorRefines …`) — 12 code sites, 4 files. Not named above until now.
  * `WitnessRealizing.LeafRefinement`, through its `refines` FIELD: reached as
    `Nonempty (LeafRefinement …)` at **18 code sites in 4 files**, including
    `AssuranceCaseGrounded.deployed_system_secure_grounded{,_v2}`,
    `grounded_capstone_engine_fires{,_v2}`, and six `GroundedApex` theorems.

At none of those 37 sites does the word `descriptorRefines` occur.

⚠ **"NO INSTRUMENT CAN SEE IT" IS FALSE, and stating it that way is how a real finding gets
over-read.** `#floor_ratchet`'s `Surface` carries `propBody` and `bundles` as a JOINT FIXPOINT
(`Verify/FloorRatchet.lean:669-670`), and every one of the 24 declarations across this chain that
was probed — this def, `EffectDecodeBridge`, `DescriptorRefinesComplete`, `LeafRefinement`,
`rejectLeaf`, `leafStep_of_refinement`, `leafSound_of_refinements`, `engineSound_of_refinements`,
three `GroundedApex` theorems, `AssuranceCaseGrounded.deployed_system_secure_grounded`, plus
`descriptorRefinesTB` and `Market.ProtocolAssurance.ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` — is ALREADY a
grandfathered row in `FloorRatchetBaseline`. The ratchet SEES this class and PERMITS it. What the
prop-body placement hides is the declaration's TYPE: `#print`, `#check`, a human reader, and an
`#assert_axioms` audit all see a clean signature. Two different failures; only the second is this
def's, and the fix for the first is a shorter baseline, not a new instrument.

⚠ **"the (separately refuted) `CommitSurface` bundle" IS STALE — as of `1f53df6d2`, TODAY.**
`ApexPremiseVacuity.ApexCommitFloor` is the five-conjunct list `compressInjective cmb ∧
compressInjective compress ∧ compressNInjective compressN ∧ cellLeafInjective CH ∧
RestHashIffFrame RH`, and `apexCommitFloor_unsatisfiable` kills it through the FIFTH conjunct, by
Cantor. `CommitSurface` at HEAD has NONE of those five as fields — the four injectivity ones are
deleted (§1's tombstone) and the fifth is `RestHashIffFrameFin RH` — and it has a CLOSED inhabitant,
the anonymous `noncomputable example : CommitSurface` at
`Verify/RestFrameFiniteSupportSuccessor.lean:348`. So `(S : CommitSurface) → ¬ P S` is no longer
free and a refutability pole AT THE BUNDLE is stateable for the first time.

That does not make `ApexFloorFree.CommitMap` unnecessary; it changes the REASON, and the old reason
is about to be copied into two more files. `descriptorRefinesFree_false_at_False_kstep` needs a
commit map that HITS the opaque published value `tracePublishedCommit emptyTrace` — that is what
`ApexFloorFree.collapseMap` is for. `S.commit` is `recStateCommit` of `S`'s five primitives and
cannot be chosen to hit an opaque target. **The move to `CommitMap` is because the map must be
ARBITRARY, not because the bundle is empty.**

⚑ **AND THE TOOTH MAY NOT BE A NAMED THEOREM.** A declaration whose TYPE mentions `CommitSurface`
is a `#floor_ratchet` `bundle-user` carrier and the gate hard-errors on a new one; the established
discipline for a reference-pole object is an ANONYMOUS `example`
(`Verify/RestFrameFiniteSupportSuccessor.lean` §6, `TurnDecodeChainLogBundleCutoverCheck` §1/§5).
Whether `CommitSurface` is still computed into `Surface.bundles` after the drain is a question only
a root `#floor_ratchet` run answers, and the root cannot elaborate today — that run is step 0 of the
port, not an assumption of it.

**SMALLEST FIRST STEP, and it is not this def.** `FloorCensus.sentinelPropBody` is
`[descriptorRefines]` and nothing else, so porting THIS def requires editing `FloorCensus.lean` in
the same commit — which the vacuity-campaign lanes are forbidden to touch, so it needs the operator,
and it is the first work item rather than a reason to stop. The other two prop-body carriers were in
no sentinel list and could land alone: `RotatedKernelRefinementFacetTurnBound.descriptorRefinesTB`
(3 live code sites) and `Market.ProtocolAssurance.ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` (5). Baseline rows
blocked neither — `FloorRatchetBaseline` is emitted as `baseline ∩ current` and its only healthy
direction is shorter, so a row left stale by a port is green.

⚑ **BOTH OF THOSE TWO ARE NOW DELETED (2026-08-02).** They were retired onto
`RotatedKernelRefinementFacetTurnBound.descriptorRefinesTBKernelFree` and
`Market.ProtocolAssurance.ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesKernel` — floor-free, `CommitMap`-stated,
publication-link-carrying, conclusions weakened to their kernel-endpoint halves with the receipt-chain
clause named as a per-instance residual (`FacetLogResidual`, `ShieldedRingLogResidual`). Tombstones sit
at their former definition sites. Of the three prop-body carriers this docblock named, THIS def is the
one still standing, and it is the one whose port needs the `FloorCensus.lean` edit above. ⚠ The route was
DELETION and not `FloorCensus.portedPropBody`: that ratchet requires the ported name to STILL RESOLVE, so
a retired-and-deleted def must not be added to it. Whether any prop-body carrier this docblock did not
name survives is a question only a root `#floor_ratchet`/census run answers. -/

/-! ## §4 — `StateDecodeChain`: decode a whole turn; the FRAME is DERIVED.

A turn is a list of actions; the circuit witnesses it as a list of per-step circuit witnesses, each
publishing its own OLD/NEW commitment. `StateDecodeChain` decodes the whole turn:

  * `pre₀` is the turn pre-state;
  * each step `i` has a witness with a faithful `StateDecode` to `(sᵢ, sᵢ₊₁)`;
  * the published NEW commitment of step `i` and the published OLD commitment of step `i+1` AGREE
    (the prover's chained-root column — `foldStepRoots` in `TurnCircuitCompose`).

The cross-step FRAME (that the post-state of one step IS the pre-state of the next) is then a
THEOREM, not an assumption: equal published commitments + faithfulness force `sᵢ₊₁.kernel = sᵢ₊₁.kernel`
across the seam. We state the per-seam continuity as `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`. -/

/-- A decoded turn step: the action, its descriptor, the published commitment, and the faithful

/-- **`NoSeamCommitColl S steps` — the per-adjacency commitment residual, chained.** At EVERY seam of
a decoded chain, `S`'s commitment primitives do not collide at the NAMED argument pairs the seam's
extraction visits. The kernel-side twin of `NoLogSeamColl` (§8's 2026-07-25 log cutover), with the
same `List.IsChain` shape so the two fold together.

⚑ One named pair per seam, never `∃ two colliding inputs`: a global collision existential is supplied
by pigeonhole at deployed BabyBear width and would make the whole condition vacuous
(`StateCommitReduce.orBreak_stateBreakP_iff_True`). -/

per-adjacency side condition on any decoded chain. This is the one step between the landed bridge
`CommitSurface.noCommitColl_of_carriers` (the four deleted injectivity fields kill every residual) and
`NoSeamCommitColl`, so the pre-deletion statements are recovered by a single composition WITHOUT
minting a new declaration on a refuted floor. -/

/-- **Cross-step frame continuity is DERIVED, not assumed.** If two adjacent decoded steps publish the
SAME boundary commitment (`a.pc.pubPost = b.pc.pubPre`) at the same turn, and the post of `a` / the
pre of `b` are `AccountsWF`, then their kernels COINCIDE — the frame at the seam is forced by the
commitment binding, not a free hypothesis.

(The shared boundary commitment is the prover's chained-root column; equating it across the seam is
the `foldStepRoots` glue from `TurnCircuitCompose`. The `turn`-equality is the boundary-turn agreement
the layout pins.)

⚑ **NARROWED 2026-07-31**: the seam kernels must be FINITELY REPRESENTABLE (`hfin`/`hfin'`). The
frame is still DERIVED and not assumed; it is derived on a smaller class of states.

⚑ **EXTRACTOR FORM 2026-08-01 (second pass).** The conclusion is UNCONDITIONAL again, and the crypto
reliance is the explicit per-instance `hno`. The first pass wrapped the conclusion in
`OrBreak S.StateBreak`, which is `True` at every deployed-shaped surface
(`CommitSurface.orBreak_stateBreak_iff_True`) — so that form asserted nothing about the seam. `hno` is
a claim about the ONE pair of kernels at THIS seam, refutable at a broken hash and satisfiable at an
honest one. A prover who publishes a seam commitment disagreeing with the threaded kernel is rejected
unless the deployed hash collides at exactly those named points. -/

/-! ## §5 — the minimal honest STARK-batch interface.

None of `VerifyKey`, `verifyBatch`, `vkOfRegistry`, or the STARK-batch soundness existed. We define
the minimal HONEST interface here and SAY SO:

  * `VerifyKey` — an opaque verifying key (the committed registry the verifier is pinned to).
  * `vkOfRegistry` — the VK↔registry binding: the live registry's commitment IS the VK.
  * `BatchPublicInputs` — the public inputs a batch proof exposes: the descriptor name/effect index it
    claims, the published OLD/NEW commitments (= `pi.pre`/`pi.post`), and the boundary turn.
  * `Accept` — the verdict; `verifyBatch vk pi π` is `accept` exactly when the proof checks.
  * `StarkSound` — the AUDITED p3 batch-STARK soundness, as a named class: a verifying batch yields a
    `Satisfied2` witness of the CLAIMED descriptor whose published PI AGREE with `pi`. This is the FRI
    extraction obligation; REALIZABLE, audited, NOT provable in Lean — carried as a class, not faked.

`liveRegistry` is the effect→descriptor map; we keep it abstract (a function `EffectIdx →
EffectVmDescriptor2`) so the apex is parametric in it — the concrete binding to
`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.v3Registry` is a registry-lookup wrapper a downstream instance supplies. -/

/-! ### The deployed verifier configuration (the honest KAT floor).

`verifyBatch` is no longer a fully-opaque function: it runs the specified batch-STARK verifier plus
the quartic-extension FRI fold at a fixed deployed configuration. Everything ABOVE this floor
(continued transcript derivation, query/beta binding, full-lane p3 fold, rejection teeth,
`wrap_sound`) is concrete Lean. The configuration constants below are the residue that is
NOT proved: the deployed p3 verifier's fixed knobs (Poseidon2 permutation `cfgPerm`, sponge `cfgRATE`,
index extraction `cfgToNat`, FRI parameters `cfgParams`, the baked recursion-VK shape `cfgVk`, the
base/extension arithmetic and hashing leaves, the challenger init state `cfgInitState`, the
log-domain size `cfgLogN`), and the byte-deserialization views `cfgView`/`cfgExtView` (proof/PI bytes → the structured
`BatchProofData`/`WrapPublics` the verifier walks), and the residual non-FRI checks `cfgExtra`. They
are left UNSPECIFIED (`opaque`) and are validated by the differential KAT corpus against the deployed
p3 verifier — the validation-tier floor, the same status as Poseidon2 bit-exactness. -/

validated against the deployed p3 verifier for ONE registry. Nothing in them is a function of a
registry, so the only honest way for `verifyBatch` to consult its key is to check that the key IS
this one. Which registry `cfgKey` commits to is the same KAT-tier fact as the rest of the

scalar fold is retained only as a redundant soundness-refinement conjunct.

The key is consulted: under any key other than `cfgKey` the verdict is `reject`
(`verifyBatch_rejects_foreign_key`), so `verifyBatch (vkOfRegistry R) pi π = accept` genuinely
depends on `R` — it forces `vkOfRegistry R = cfgKey` (`verifyBatch_accept_iff`). An earlier
revision bound the key as `_vk` and never read it, so `StarkSound hash R`'s hypothesis was the
same proposition for every registry while its conclusion named `R pi.effect`. -/

verify⟹∃witness extraction: REALIZABLE and audited, but NOT provable in Lean — introduced as a clean
class so the apex carries it explicitly instead of assuming it silently.

The hypothesis depends on `R` through its key: `verifyBatch (vkOfRegistry R)` accepts only when
`vkOfRegistry R = cfgKey`. So the class is contentless for a registry the deployed configuration
was not validated for (`starkSound_of_foreign_key`) and is exactly the extraction over the

/-! ## §6 — the apex: `lightclient_unfoolable`.

The apex's ONLY data inputs are what a light client actually has: the public inputs `pi` and the proof
`π`. It does NOT take `pre`/`post` or a `StateDecode` as hypotheses — those would HIDE the hardest rung
(that the published commitments are commits of REAL kernel states), turning the theorem into a
conditional refinement rather than unfoolability. Instead the apex DERIVES the decode, from named
floors only, and CONCLUDES the existence of a genuine kernel boundary.

The floors:
  * `[StarkSound hash R]` — a verifying batch yields a `Satisfied2` witness of the CLAIMED descriptor
    whose published commitments ARE `pi.toPublished` (the strengthened extraction).
  * `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` + the `CommitSurface` CR fields — the decode's faithfulness floor.
  * `hrefines` — the per-effect refinement rung (`Satisfied2 + StateDecode ⟹ kstep`).
  * `WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` — the NEW carried obligation: a witness publishing `pi` decodes to
    SOME `(pre, post)`. This is the genuinely-hard witness→kernel-state EXISTENCE rung; carried, not
    proved-by-assuming-the-conclusion.

Derivation chain: STARK extracts a witness `t` with `tracePublishedCommit t = pi.toPublished` →
`WitnessDecodes` produces `pre`/`post` with `StateDecode S pi.toPublished pre post` → `hrefines` turns
the witness + decode into `kstep pi.effect pre post` → the decode's binding re-exports `pi.pre`/`pi.post`
as the genuine endpoint commitments. The result is the honest headline: `(pi, π)` + named floors ⟹
∃ a real kernel transition committing to `pi`. The light client RAN NOTHING.

### SCOPE — what this apex proves, and what it does NOT (the freshness boundary).

`lightclient_unfoolable` proves **SINGLE-TRANSITION soundness**: every accepted batch decodes to a
GENUINE kernel step `pre ⟶ post` committing to `pi.pre`/`pi.post`. It takes `pi.turn` as a GIVEN.
It establishes NOTHING about whether that transition is **FRESH** (not already applied), nor about
its ORDERING relative to other turns. A light client verifying `(pi, π)` learns "this is a REAL
transition", NOT "this is a fresh, unreplayed transition".

Cross-turn FRESHNESS / NO-REPLAY / ordering is **NOT part of THIS theorem**. Its LOGIC is now modeled
and proved in `Dregg2.Circuit.Freshness` — `no_replay`/`deployed_no_replay` PARAMETRIC over a
`CommitSurface`, with nonce-monotonicity DERIVED from the deployed executor (`nonce_strictly_increases`
= `CrossTurnFreshness.runTurn_forest_strictly_advances`, not assumed). HONEST RESIDUAL: grounding a
CONCRETE surface currently pulls in `RestHashIffFrame` (the infinite-domain-state binding — DEBT B in
docs/reference/CARRIER-CENSUS.md), unrealizable until the function-valued kernel fields are refined to
finite maps. So: the no-replay LOGIC is proved; its full crypto grounding on `Poseidon2SpongeCR` ALONE
awaits the finite-map data refinement. The DEPLOYED machinery this
single-transition apex does not itself model:
  * the **commitment-chain CAS** (`proof_verify.rs`): the live stored commitment must equal the
    proof's pre-anchor; applying the proof advances the live commitment to the post-anchor — modeled
    as `LiveCommitMatches` over a `Freshness.CommitChain`;
  * **cell-nonce monotonicity** (`cell_state.rs` "Monotonic"): the agent nonce is bound INTO
    `recStateCommit` (it lives in the agent cell's leaf, hashed through the leaf hash `CH`) and
    strictly increases each turn, so the commitment sequence never cycles — a consumed `pre` never
    recurs. This is a THEOREM, not an assumption: `Freshness.commit_binds_nonce` (equal commitment ⟹
    equal nonce — a nonce difference is a Poseidon collision) and `Freshness.nonce_strictly_increases`
    (every accepted `Admission.runTurn` over the live `execFullForestA` forest body strictly advances
    the agent nonce — the never-rolled-back committed prologue's `+1`, with the whole body proved
    nonce-nondecreasing per-arm and all three nonce-reset vectors closed at the executor).

A light client that wants freshness MUST additionally track the live stored commitment (the CAS) and
reject any proof whose pre-anchor ≠ the live commitment; the proof `(pi, π)` ALONE does not establish
freshness. The cross-turn close — `commit-chain + nonce-monotone ⟹ each proof applicable at most
once` — is `Freshness.no_replay` / `replay_rejected_after_apply`, lifted onto the LIVE forest executor
by `Freshness.deployed_no_replay` (the accepted-`runTurn` sequence IS a monotone `CommitChain`; the
advance is DERIVED, not assumed). Its crypto residual is EXACTLY `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (the four
sponge-shaped CR fields — root/node/frame/leaf — all reduce to that one hash floor via
the historical `Freshness.poseidon2CommitSurface`, now the floor-free `spongeCommitSurface`) plus the
PROVED nonce-monotone invariant;
the deployed replacement is `CommitFaithfulRegrounded.no_replay_faithful` — ⚠ WITH THE CAVEAT that
⚑ THIS CAVEAT IS NOW SPENT AND THE TEXT IS CORRECTED. It read "its `FaithfulBreak` opens with a
global-existential `SpongeCollision compressN` and so holds freely at deployed width" — TRUE when
written, FALSE since: `FaithfulBreak` was NARROWED and now opens with `CompressColl cmb` at a named
pair, and the free version was renamed `FaithfulBreakGlobal`. A correction can go stale faster than
the claim it corrected, which is why it names the object rather than describing it. The sole non-crypto
carrier is the structural `RestHashIffFrame` (not sponge-reducible — the state carries function-valued
components). Do NOT read "a light client that runs nothing cannot be fooled" as covering replay: it
covers AUTHENTICITY of a single transition; FRESHNESS is the CAS's job, discharged in `Freshness`. -/

/-- **`WitnessDecodes hash R S pi` — the witness→kernel-state EXISTENCE rung (NAMED, not faked).**

Any `Satisfied2` witness of the claimed descriptor `R pi.effect` that PUBLISHES `pi.toPublished` (its
rotated PI old/new commitments equal `pi`'s) decodes to SOME `(pre, post)` via a faithful
`StateDecode`. This is the existence of REAL well-formed kernel states behind the published roots — the
surjectivity of the commitment surface on the values a verifying witness pins. A light client cannot
supply `pre`/`post`; this rung SUPPLIES them. It must NOT be discharged by assuming the apex's
conclusion — it is carried EXPLICITLY (exactly as `StarkSound` is), and the apex consumes it to derive
the decode. REALIZABLE (the prover committed to the kernels whose roots the trace publishes). -/

/-! ## §7 — the headline corollary: a genuine kernel TURN (forest-composition shape).

The natural downstream `kstep` is the dispatcher arm: a single committed `fullActionStep`. A turn is a
list of such steps composed by `turnSpec`, which `execFullTurnA_iff_turnSpec` identifies with the real
executor `execFullTurnA`. `lightclient_turn_unfoolable` packages the apex at this `kstep` over a
SINGLE-action turn, and re-exports it as a genuine `execFullTurnA` run — the "∃ genuine kernel
transition" headline. Multi-step composition chains these via `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`
(§4): the per-seam frame is DERIVED from the shared published commitments, so a chain of single-action
apexes folds into a whole-turn `turnSpec` exactly as `TurnCircuitCompose.turn_emitted_refines_exec_direct`
folds its per-step `hstep`. -/

/-! ## §8 — the WHOLE-TURN apex: composing the per-effect rung along a turn (FOREST shape).

§6/§7 land the apex on ONE effect. A turn is a LIST of effects, witnessed by a LIST of per-step circuit
witnesses, each publishing its own OLD/NEW commitment (the prover's chained-root column). This section
LIFTS the single-effect apex to a whole-turn statement: from the carried per-effect family `hrefines :
∀ e, descriptorRefines (R e) (dispatchArm e)` + the named floors, derive that a turn whose EVERY step's
circuit is satisfied yields a genuine `execFullTurnA s acts = some s'` over chained kernel states whose
ENDPOINTS commit to the published turn-level `(pre, post)`.

The composition is the §4 `DecodedStep` chain, folded:

  * `TurnDecodeChain` — a list of `DecodedStep`s threaded left-to-right so each step's post IS the next
    step's pre (`a.post = b.pre` as a FULL chained state — the executor's actual carried state), with
    the published seam commitments AGREEING across the boundary (`a.pc.pubPost = b.pc.pubPre`) at one
    boundary turn. The KERNEL half of the seam is then DERIVED — `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`
    proves the threaded kernels coincide from the published-commitment binding, so a prover who
    publishes a seam commitment disagreeing with the threaded kernel is REJECTED (the frame TOOTH). The
    chain is the §4 frame made whole-turn: not assumed, certified.

  * `turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec` — fold the per-step `descriptorRefines` (each step's circuit
    witness + faithful decode ⟹ its `dispatchArm`) along the chain into the declarative `turnSpec`,
    mirroring `TurnCircuitCompose.turn_emitted_refines_exec_direct`'s shape but landing on the ROTATED
    `dispatchArm` (not the universe-A `stepEmittedSat`).

  * `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` — the whole-turn headline: a verified turn (every step's
    circuit satisfied, decoded, seam-published) + `hrefines` + floors ⟹ `∃ acts s s', execFullTurnA s
    acts = some s' ∧ turn-pre = commit s ∧ turn-post = commit s'`. Re-exported to `execFullForestG` by
    the existing `WholeTurnTriangle.execFullForestG_eq_execFullTurnG` lowering downstream.

### NEW carried obligation (named, added to the ledger — NOT laundered)

  * `seamFullState` (a field of `TurnDecodeChain`) — the FULL-state seam `a.post = b.pre`. The
    commitment surface commits ONLY the `RecChainedState.kernel` (`recStateCommit` takes a
    `RecordKernelState`), so the published seam binds the KERNEL half of `a.post = b.pre`
    (DERIVED, the tooth) but NOT the `log` (receipt-chain) half. The executor `execFullTurnA` threads
    the FULL state; thus the log-continuity of the seam is the genuine residue the commitments cannot
    certify. It is carried EXPLICITLY as a chain field (the prover threads the real executor state, so
    `a.post = b.pre` holds by construction of an honest run; a verifier obtains it from the same
    chained-root column that ties the kernels, EXTENDED to the uncommitted log column). REALIZABLE
    (the honest prover's post IS the next pre); named, not assumed silently. The kernel half is
    re-derived as the frame TOOTH (`turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived`) so the commitment binding
    stays load-bearing on the part it covers. -/

/-- **`TurnDecodeChain S start steps fin`** — a whole-turn decode: a list of §4 `DecodedStep`s threaded
left-to-right from `start` to `fin`, each step's circuit satisfied, with the published seam
commitments agreeing across boundaries. The frame's KERNEL half is DERIVED
(`turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived`); the full-state `seam`/`headPre`/`lastPost` fields carry the
uncommitted `log` residue (the NAMED obligation). -/

  pubSeam   : List.IsChain (fun a b => a.pc.turn = b.pc.turn ∧ a.pc.pubPost = b.pc.pubPre) steps

/-- **The frame TOOTH (kernel half DERIVED, not assumed).** For every adjacent pair in a
`TurnDecodeChain`, the published seam commitments FORCE the threaded kernels to coincide
(`a.post.kernel = b.pre.kernel`) — `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous` applied along the chain. So a
prover whose published seam commitment disagrees with the threaded kernel is REJECTED: the kernel half
of `seam` is certified by the commitment binding, not taken on faith.

⚑ **NARROWED 2026-07-31**: `hfin` says every threaded kernel is FINITELY REPRESENTABLE. Stated as a
per-step hypothesis rather than a field of `DecodedStep` so the restriction is VISIBLE in the
signature of every theorem that uses it, instead of hiding inside a carried structure.

⚑ **EXTRACTOR FORM 2026-08-01 (second pass).** The per-adjacency side condition is carried as a chain
(`NoSeamCommitColl`), exactly as the LOG half already carried `NoLogSeamColl` — same shape, same
`List.IsChain` fold, one named pair per seam. The first pass instead wrapped the whole conclusion in
ONE `OrBreak S.StateBreak`; that reads as economical ("a single collision anywhere is a single break")
but the disjunct is free at deployed parameters, so the economy was that the theorem said nothing. -/

/-! ### §8.1 — the turn-level endpoint commitments (DERIVED from the chain's first/last step).

The whole-turn headline must export the PUBLISHED turn-level `(pre, post)` as genuine commitments of
the executor's endpoint kernels (`start`/`fin`). The turn's published pre/post commitments are exactly
the head step's `pubPre` and the last step's `pubPost` (the two open ends of the prover's chained-root
column). `TurnEndpoints` says the turn-level published commitments AND turn are pinned to those open
ends; `turnDecodeChain_endpoints_commit` then DERIVES, from the head/last step decodes alone, that the
published turn-level pre/post ARE `S.commit start.kernel` / `S.commit fin.kernel` — the endpoint
commitments are forced by the same per-step binding the seams use, not assumed. -/

/-- **`TurnEndpoints`** — the turn-level published commitment view pinned to the chain's open ends. The
published turn-pre/turn-post commitments equal the head step's `pubPre` / the last step's `pubPost`
(the two unmatched ends of the prover's chained-root column), at the boundary turn `tp.turn`, which
agrees with the head/last step's commitment turn. On an EMPTY turn there is no step root to read, so the
degenerate branch carries the endpoint binding DIRECTLY (`tp.pubPre`/`tp.pubPost = S.commit start.kernel
tp.turn`, with `start = fin` so both endpoints commit to the same kernel) — named, not laundered. -/

/-! ### §8.2 — `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest`: the WHOLE-TURN apex.

The headline. A verified turn — a `TurnDecodeChain` (every step's circuit `Satisfied2`, decoded, the
published seams agreeing) + the per-step effect-index identification (`hidx`) + the turn-level endpoint
pinning (`TurnEndpoints`) — together with the named floors (`hCR` + the carried per-effect family
`hrefines`) yields a GENUINE executor run `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin` whose ENDPOINTS commit
to the published turn-level `(pre, post)`. The light client RAN NOTHING; it verified per-step accepts
and read the two open ends of the chained-root column.

The derivation:
  1. `stepsRefine_of_descriptorRefines` discharges the per-step `dispatchArm` from the carried
     `hrefines` family + the per-step circuit accepts (`c.sat`) + faithful decodes (`d.decode`);
  2. `turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec` folds those along the threaded (kernel-half-certified) chain
     into `∃ acts, turnSpec start acts fin`;
  3. `execFullTurnA_iff_turnSpec` lowers `turnSpec` to the real executor `execFullTurnA`;
  4. `turnDecodeChain_endpoints_commit` re-exports the published turn-level pre/post as the genuine
     endpoint commitments (`S.commit start.kernel` / `S.commit fin.kernel`).

`execFullForestG`: the natural tree-shaped run lowers to this linear `execFullTurnA` by the existing
`Exec.FullForestAuth.execFullForestG_eq_execFullTurnG` / `Spec.WholeTurnTriangle` bridge — a forest is
the pre-order lowering of its turns, so this whole-turn statement is the linear core the forest run
factors through. -/

/-! ## §9 — the INTRA-TURN RECEIPT-LOG seam: binding the LOG half of `a.post = b.pre`.

The kernel half of the turn-chain seam is DERIVED (`turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived` /
`stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous`): the published seam commitments FORCE `a.post.kernel = b.pre.kernel`,
because `CommitSurface.commit` (= `recStateCommit`) BINDS the kernel. But `recStateCommit` is
KERNEL-ONLY (`RecordKernelState → Turn → ℤ`; the `RecChainedState.log` receipt chain is NOT one of its
inputs), so the published kernel seam says NOTHING about the `log`. The full-state `seam` field of
`TurnDecodeChain` (`a.post = b.pre` over the WHOLE `RecChainedState`, log included) therefore carried
its LOG half as a free residue: a prover could publish a turn-chain whose kernels chain genuinely while
the intermediate RECEIPT-LOG an observer reads is FORGED. The dregg through-line — "a turn leaves a
VERIFIABLE receipt" — was unforced at the composition seam.

This section CLOSES that, mirroring the kernel tooth EXACTLY. The per-step published LOG commitments
(the `EffectCommit.CommitSurface.LH` field's two published values — `effectStateCommit` already commits
`cmb (cellDigest) (cmb (RH) (LH log))`, so the deployed surface DOES publish + bind the log) are bound
to `pre.log`/`post.log` through the realizable `logHashInjective LH` carrier (the SAME class as the
Poseidon/Merkle CR set — a hypothesis, never an axiom; exactly what `EffectCommit.effectCircuit_rejects_log_forge`
realizes). A published LOG seam (`a.logPubPost = b.logPubPre`, the log column of the chained-root) then
FORCES `a.post.log = b.pre.log` by `LH`-injectivity — the receipt-log half of the seam is CERTIFIED by
the commitment binding, not taken on faith. Combined with the kernel tooth, the FULL `a.post = b.pre`
seam is DERIVED: a forged intermediate receipt-log can't satisfy both the published log seam and the
`logHashInjective` binding without a hash collision.

This is the apex analog of the per-step `ClosureLog.StateDecodeLog` (which forces ONE step's
`post.log = receipt :: pre.log`); here we force the CROSS-STEP log continuity the turn fold consumes. -/

/-- **`LogDecode LH pubLogPre pubLogPost pre post`** — the published LOG commitments of one step bind
its receipt chains through the realizable `logHashInjective LH` carrier: the published OLD/NEW log
commitments equal `LH pre.log` / `LH post.log`. The apex-seam analog of `ClosureLog.StateDecodeLog`'s
`logPreBinds`/`logPostBinds`. `LH` is the `EffectCommit.CommitSurface.LH` field; the two published
values are the log column of the prover's chained-root (mirroring how `pc.pubPre`/`pubPost` are the
kernel-root column). NO axiom: the binding is exactly the deployed `effectStateCommit`'s `LH log` leg. -/

The receipt-log half of the seam is FORCED by the `logHashInjective` binding — a prover whose published
log commitment disagrees with the threaded receipt chain is REJECTED. The faithful mirror of

REFUTES for every real deployed accumulator, so no deployed `TurnDecodeChainLog` value could be
constructed and every theorem over the bundle below was VACUOUS. The three consumers now carry the
binding as a PER-INSTANCE `NoLogSeamColl` argument at exactly the adjacencies the deleted field was fed
(a theorem HAS argument positions; a field does not — the bundle-family design decision is recorded at
`Dregg2.Shielded.RealCrypto` §2.0). `Circuit/TurnDecodeChainLogBundleCutoverCheck` constructs
`honestTurnDecodeChainLog` — the honest prover's chained-root, publishing the true log digests — for an

the old proof fed the refuted floor at, and no others — the two receipt chains the published log seam
equates are NOT an equivocation of the deployed accumulator (`LogCommitRegrounded.LogColl`, which
carries its own distinctness, so the condition is never satisfied vacuously by an equal pair).

⚑ Stated over an ABSTRACT step type with the two log projections passed in, NOT over `List
(DecodedStep S)`. That is deliberate and load-bearing: `DecodedStep S` drags in `S : CommitSurface`,
which is itself a floor-carrying bundle, so the `List (DecodedStep S)`-shaped spelling would have made
the CURE a carrier of a floor it has nothing to do with. The condition is about receipt chains; it is
now typed that way.

Implied by the deleted field at every pair via the grandfathered bridge

published log commitment disagrees with the threaded receipt-log is REJECTED: the receipt-log half of

/-- **The FULL-state seam is DERIVED (kernel ⊕ log).** Combining the kernel tooth
(`turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived`, from the published kernel-root seam) with the log tooth
(`turnDecodeChainLog_seam_log_derived`, from the published log seam) recovers the WHOLE
`RecChainedState` continuity `a.post = b.pre` — the `seam` field of `TurnDecodeChain`, previously
carried with its log half as a free residue, is now CERTIFIED on both components. A forged intermediate
receipt-log cannot satisfy both the published log seam and the `logHashInjective` binding without a
hash collision; a forged intermediate kernel cannot satisfy the published kernel seam. So the published
turn-chain BINDS the full state — receipts included.

⚑ **NARROWED 2026-07-31**: the KERNEL half now requires `hfin` (every threaded kernel finitely
representable); the LOG half is unchanged.

⚑ **EXTRACTOR FORM 2026-08-01 (second pass)**: BOTH halves now carry a per-instance, per-adjacency
residual — `NoSeamCommitColl` on the kernel side, `NoLogSeamColl` on the log side — and the conclusion
is unconditional again. The first pass wrapped the kernel half in `OrBreak S.StateBreak`, whose
disjunct is free at deployed parameters; the two halves are now the SAME shape, which is what the log
cutover had right in the first place. -/

the pre-log of step `i+1` (`hforge`), `turnDecodeChainLog_seam_log_derived` forces them EQUAL — a direct
contradiction (`False`). So no satisfying turn-chain exhibits the forge. This is the receipt-log analog
of `effectCircuit_rejects_log_forge`, lifted to the CROSS-STEP seam: the published turn-chain binds the
intermediate receipt-log, not just the kernels. -/

/-! ### §9.1 — NON-VACUITY of the log seam (the `logHashInjective` carrier is load-bearing).

The close is non-vacuous: the `hLog : logHashInjective LH` carrier is a GENUINE constraint, not free.
A collapsing log-hash (constant `LH`) is NOT injective once two distinct receipt chains exist — so a
prover CANNOT supply `hLog` for a degenerate `LH`, and the seam equation `logDecodeChain_frame_continuous`
produces is a REAL receipt-chain equality, not a trivial `True`. (Mirrors the Poseidon CR set's own
non-vacuity: a `+`-fold satisfies none of the injectivity carriers.) -/

/-- A collapsing log-hash CANNOT satisfy `logHashInjective` once two distinct receipt logs exist: the
carrier is a genuine non-trivial constraint (the don't-launder-vacuity tooth). Witnessed by the empty
log vs. any one-receipt log (`[tr]`) — distinct (different lengths), yet both hash to `0`. -/
example (tr : Turn) : ¬ logHashInjective (fun _ : List Turn => (0 : ℤ)) := by
  intro hinj
  have : ([] : List Turn) = [tr] := hinj [] [tr] rfl
  exact (by simp : ([] : List Turn) ≠ [tr]) this

/-- The log seam tooth is LOAD-BEARING: under a genuinely injective `LH`, a published log seam forces
two SEPARATELY-NAMED boundary receipt chains EQUAL. Here `a`'s post and `b`'s pre are arbitrary distinct
states; equal published log commitments at the seam (`LH a'.log = LH b.log`) pin `a'.log = b.log` — a
non-trivial cross-state equality the derivation produces (not a tautology). -/

    (a a' b b' : RecChainedState) (ap aq bp bq : ℤ)
