# DEBT-A brick 1 — BabyBear is a field that satisfies the FRI-soundness requirements

The census / DEBT-A worry was "`ZMod 5` ≠ BabyBear" — the field-generic FRI soundness
(`FriSoundness.fold_close_of_two_alpha`, `friProximity_discharge`) was only ever *instantiated* at a
`ZMod 5` demo field. But those lemmas require ONLY `[Field F] [DecidableEq F]` (`FriSoundness.lean:69`) —
no generator, no field-specific structure. So the swap to the DEPLOYED field is a clean instantiation, not
new theory. This file makes that concrete:

- **BabyBear** `p = 2³¹ − 2²⁷ + 1 = 2013265921` (`circuit/src/field.rs`, the descriptor's `field_modulus`).
- `p` is **prime** ⇒ `ZMod p` is a `Field` with `DecidableEq` — exactly what the FRI lemmas need.
- `p − 1 = 2013265920 = 15·2²⁷` ⇒ **2-adicity is EXACTLY 27**: BabyBear has the smooth power-of-two
  subgroups FRI folds over (and no more — the smoothness is precisely 2²⁷, the deployed FRI domain cap).

SCOPE (honest): this establishes BabyBear as a FIELD that meets the FRI lemmas' typeclass requirements — the
field-swap the census flagged as missing. It does NOT yet construct the BabyBear `FriGeom`/`FriSetup` (the
evaluation domain from the 2²⁷ subgroup) nor bind `friProximity_discharge` to the deployed `verifyBatch` FRI
config — those are DEBT-A bricks 2–3. Residual so far: none (this brick is `norm_num`/typeclass facts only).

theorem babyBear_two_adicity_lt_28 : ¬ (2 ^ 28 : ℕ) ∣ (babyBearP - 1) := by norm_num

/-! ## The payoff: BabyBear meets the FRI-lemma typeclass requirements.

`fold_close_of_two_alpha` / `friProximity_discharge` are stated over `variable {F : Type*} [Field F]
[DecidableEq F]` (`FriSoundness.lean:69`). BabyBear provides both instances (above), so the field-generic
BBHR18 reconstruction applies at `F := BabyBear` with NO extra field theory — the "field-swap" the census
flagged as missing is a typeclass instantiation. `debtA_babybear_meets_fri_requirements` records exactly that
(both instances inhabited); actually instantiating `fold_close_of_two_alpha` at a BabyBear `FriSetup` is DEBT-A
brick 2 (construct the BabyBear evaluation domain from the 2²⁷ subgroup + bind to the deployed FRI config). -/

/-- **BabyBear satisfies the FRI lemmas' requirements** — `Field` and `DecidableEq`, the only two classes
`fold_close_of_two_alpha` needs. So the field-generic FRI soundness specializes to the deployed field. -/
