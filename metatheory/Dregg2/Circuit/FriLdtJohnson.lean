# `FriLdtDeployedBound` — DISCHARGED as stated, and the real BCIKS20 core NAMED precisely.

This file closes out the last STARK-soundness residual named in
`BabyBearFriDeployedInstance.lean` (`FriLdtDeployedBound`, "the one research-grade assumption
every deployed STARK shares"). The result is sharper than expected.

## The finding: the STATED `FriLdtDeployedBound` is the *trivial counting branch* — a THEOREM.

`FriLdtDeployedBound εTarget` (as committed) says: a word `f` that is `(7/8)·|ι|`-FAR from the
code — disagrees with *every* codeword on ≥ `7/8` of points — accepts the `19` deployed queries
with probability `≤ εTarget`. At the Johnson radius `δ_J = 1 − √ρ = 7/8` this is exactly
`FriQuerySoundness.accept_prob_le_of_farN` at `δ = 7/8`, `k = 19`, whose conclusion is
`≤ (1 − 7/8)^19 = (1/8)^19`. So the statement **as written is unconditionally provable** — it is
the ELSE-branch (word past the *list*-decoding radius) where nothing but counting is needed.
`friLdtDeployedBound_discharge` proves it; `ldt_bound_unconditional` re-derives
`ldt_bound_is_load_bearing`'s payoff with NO hypothesis.

## What that means, and what is genuinely left.

The Johnson radius `δ_J` is the *list*-decoding radius — the radius **within** which the codeword
list is bounded. A word beyond `δ_J` from all codewords is `(7/8)`-far and handled by counting
(above). The genuinely research-grade content — the part Mathlib lacks and BCIKS20 supplies —
concerns words *inside* the `δ_J` ball but *beyond* the unique-decoding radius `(1−ρ)/2 = 63/128`,
and splits into TWO clean `Prop`s, each PROVED here at its unique-decoding (`L = 1`) instance and
NAMED precisely at the Johnson (`L > 1`) generalization:

* **(i) Reed–Solomon list size** (`§2`): `RSListBound C eJ L` — the codeword list within radius `eJ`
  of any word has size `≤ L`. Proved at the unique-decoding radius with `L = 1`
  (`rsListBound_uniqueDecoding`, from the Hamming triangle inequality `hamming_triangle` +
  `decoding_list_subsingleton`), and instantiated on the **real deployed rate-`1/64` RS code**
  (`§4`, `wrap_unique_decoding_singleton`: two codewords `63`-close to `f` are equal — the exact
  deployed MDS minimum distance `127`). The `L > 1` bound up to `δ_J` is the BCIKS20 Johnson bound.

* **(ii) Correlated agreement / proximity gap** (`§3`): `FriProximityGapChallenges S dOut dIn L` — a
  word `dOut`-far from the domain code has at most `L` folding challenges whose fold is `dIn`-close
  to the folded code. Proved at the unique-decoding radius with `L = 1` (`proximityGap_uniqueDecoding`,
  exactly the committed `good_alpha_subsingleton`). The `L > 1` version up to `δ_J` is the BCIKS20
  correlated-agreement theorem.

Nothing is faked: no `axiom`, no `sorry`. Each residual is a `Prop`, and each is shown to
*generalize a proved theorem* (non-vacuous, precisely scoped), not opaque hardness.
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} throughout.

/-! ## §1. The STATED bound is the trivial counting branch — DISCHARGED. -/

/-- **`FriLdtDeployedBound ((1/8)^19)` is a THEOREM.** The committed statement — a `(7/8)·|ι|`-far
word accepts `19` uniform queries with probability `≤ (1/8)^19` — is exactly the counting bound
`accept_prob_le_of_farN` at `δ = 7/8`, `k = 19`: `(1 − 7/8)^19 = (1/8)^19`. So the "one research
assumption" *as literally written* carries no hardness; it is the else-branch (word beyond the
list-decoding radius) where counting alone suffices. -/

`FriLdtDeployedBound ((1/8)^19)` as a hypothesis; `friLdtDeployedBound_discharge` supplies it, so a
Johnson-far word on the deployed wrap-rate code accepts the `19` queries with probability `≤ 2^-57`
with no assumption. -/

/-! ## §2. Genuine list-decoding: the Hamming triangle inequality and the singleton at the
unique-decoding radius.

The tractable, fully-closed half of BCIKS20's Johnson list bound: at the UNIQUE-decoding radius the
list is a *singleton*. The proof is the metric triangle inequality on Hamming distance plus the
code's minimum distance — no field-specific machinery. -/

/-- **Minimum-distance hypothesis.** Distinct codewords of `C` disagree on more than `m` points
(relative minimum distance `> m/|ι|`). For a rate-`ρ` Reed–Solomon code this holds with
`m = |ι| − dim − 1` (the MDS / Singleton bound); `§4` discharges it for the deployed code. -/

/-- **The decoding list at radius `e` is a SINGLETON when `minDist > 2e`.** Two codewords each
`e`-close to `f`, in a code of minimum distance `> 2e`, are equal — the unique-decoding radius is
`(minDist)/2`. Their mutual distance is `≤ 2e < minDist` by the Hamming triangle, forcing equality.
This is the `L = 1` instance of the Johnson list bound. -/

the Johnson radius), the codeword list has size `≤ L`. PROVED below at the unique-decoding radius

/-- **`RSListBound` holds at `L = 1` at the unique-decoding radius — a THEOREM.** The `L = 1`
instance follows from `decoding_list_subsingleton`: the list is empty or a singleton, so it is
contained in a finset of size `≤ 1`. This certifies `RSListBound` is non-vacuous; the residual is
only `L > 1` up to the Johnson radius. -/

/-! ## §3. The correlated-agreement / proximity-gap primitive, over the FRI fold.

The second research-grade piece: a word far from the domain code has only a bounded LIST of folding
challenges that fold it back close to the code. Named over the setup's own fold, so it is scoped to
the Reed–Solomon structure (the proximity gap is a property of RS + the FRI fold, NOT of arbitrary
codes). PROVED here at the unique-decoding radius with `L = 1`; the `L > 1` version up to the
Johnson radius is the named BCIKS20 residual. -/

/-- **`FriProximityGapChallenges S dOut dIn L`** — the BCIKS20 correlated-agreement statement at list
bound `L`: a word `dOut`-FAR from the domain code `S.C` has at most `L` folding challenges `α` whose
fold `Fold S.geom α f` is `dIn`-close to the folded code `S.C'`. The good-challenge set is contained
in a finset of size `≤ L`. -/

/-- **The proximity gap holds at `L = 1` at the unique-decoding radius — a THEOREM.** This is exactly
`good_alpha_subsingleton`: a `4d`-far word has at most ONE good challenge (fold-soundness error
`≤ 1/|F|`). It certifies `FriProximityGapChallenges` is non-vacuous and precisely scoped; the
residual is only the *larger* list bound `L > 1` for `dOut` up to the Johnson radius. -/

/-! ## §4. The deployed rate-`1/64` RS code: minimum distance `127`, hence the unique-decoding list
is a singleton at the deployed `63`-close radius.

`codeC 6 ω = {x ↦ a + b·ω^x}` is a degree-`< 2` Reed–Solomon code on `128` points; a nonzero
codeword `(a−a') + (b−b')·ω^x` is a nonzero affine function of the injective point map `x ↦ ω^x`, so
it vanishes on at most ONE point — minimum distance `≥ 127 = 128 − 2 + 1` (the MDS bound at
`dim = 2`). Hence at the unique-decoding radius `63` the codeword list is a singleton. `ω = omega128`
is a primitive `128`-th root, so `x ↦ ω^x` is injective on `Fin 128`. -/

/-- **`omega128` is a primitive `128`-th root of unity.** `omega128^(2^6) = −1` gives
`omega128^(2^7) = 1` and order not dividing `2^6`, so the order is exactly `2^7 = 128` (the standard
`orderOf_eq_prime_pow` argument, as in `TraceColumnInterp.omega27_isPrimitiveRoot`). -/
