# Dregg2.Circuit.FriVerifier — a LEAN SPEC of the batch-STARK FRI verifier ALGORITHM,
and the REFINEMENT statement for the gnark/BN254 ETH-wrap circuit.

**Why this module exists.** dregg's existing circuit-soundness tower models the
deployed p3 batch-STARK verifier as an OPAQUE verdict: `opaque verifyBatch :
VerifyKey → BatchPublicInputs → BatchProof → Verdict` (`CircuitSoundness.lean §5`),
with `StarkSound.extract` ASSUMING `accept ⟹ ∃ witness`. That is correct and
sufficient for a light client that CALLS the Rust verifier and trusts the carrier.

The ETH-native wrap (`docs/deos/ETH-NATIVE-WRAP.md`) is different: it RE-IMPLEMENTS
the verifier as a gnark/BN254 arithmetic circuit. An opaque verdict gives nothing
to refine against. So here the verifier ALGORITHM — the `DuplexChallenger` Fiat-
Shamir transcript, the FRI commit-phase challenge derivation, the query sampling —
becomes a SPECIFIED Lean function `verifyAlgo`, and the gnark circuit is shown to
REFINE it. The wrap's one load-bearing unknown ("bit-exact transcript fidelity / a
silent soundness break") becomes a refinement THEOREM.

**The honest carrier/proven line** (`docs/deos/FRI-VERIFIER-PROOF-ENGINEERING.md §0`,
`metatheory/docs/STARK-FLOOR.md`):

  * FRI SOUNDNESS ("accepting FRI proof ⟹ committed codeword is low-degree, up to
    soundness error ⟹ ∃ extractable witness") stays a NAMED TERMINAL CRYPTO CARRIER
    — `FriLowDegreeSound` below, a Prop class, exactly as `StarkSound` /
    `Poseidon2SpongeCR` are carried. We do NOT re-derive FRI in Lean.
  * The verifier ALGORITHM (challenger squeezes, fold, query/Merkle checks, the
    three teeth) is CODE → it gets a Lean spec here + a refinement proof. The
    transcript model (§1) is the keystone: it is the load-bearing unknown, and it is
    fully concrete and deterministic.

`#assert_axioms` on the theorems here stays `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}`: the FRI floor enters as a typeclass HYPOTHESIS, never an `axiom`. No
`sorry`. The verifier sub-checks are now ALL concrete: the FRI fold-chain + Merkle
recompute (§1b), AND the per-table quotient / logup interaction bus / degree-bit checks
(§3b `batchTablesCheck`). Query PoW cannot be checked from a witness value alone: its
deployed transcript-bound check is `FriChallengerUnified.queryPowCheckUnified`; this base
module checks only the singleton wire shape in `FriChecks.queryPow`.
`verifyAlgo → StarkSound` bridge (getting the verifier algorithm OUT of the apex's TCB)
is `Dregg2.Circuit.FriVerifierBridge`; the REAL Poseidon2-w16 hash, KAT-validated
bit-exact, is `Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2BabyBearW16`.

Self-contained over an abstract field `F` + permutation `perm` + canonical
projection `toNat` — no heavy imports, builds fast, mirrors how `Poseidon2Binding`
abstracts the sponge.

/-! ## 1. The Fiat-Shamir transcript model — `Challenger` (THE KEYSTONE).

A pure functional model of the deployed
`DuplexChallenger<F=BabyBear, Perm=Poseidon2BabyBear<16>, WIDTH=16, RATE=8>`
(`circuit-prove/src/plonky3_recursion_impl.rs:88`; semantics from p3-challenger
`duplex_challenger.rs`). The transcript is the part the in-circuit gnark challenger
MUST reproduce byte-for-byte; modeling it exactly is the highest-leverage slice.

We abstract over:
  * `F` — the field element type (BabyBear in deployment),
  * `perm : List F → List F` — the Poseidon2-w16 permutation (length-`WIDTH`
    preserving; we do not need that invariant in types for the determinism/
    refinement results),
  * `toNat : F → Nat` — `as_canonical_u64` (the canonical representative),
  * `WIDTH RATE : Nat` — the sponge geometry (16 / 8 in deployment).

The Rust semantics captured EXACTLY:
  * `duplexing`: overwrite the FIRST `inputBuffer.length` state lanes with the input
    buffer (leaving the rest), permute, set `outputBuffer := permuted[..RATE]`,
    clear the input buffer.
  * `observe v`: clear the output buffer (any buffered output is now invalid), push
    `v`, and duplex iff the input buffer reached `RATE`.
  * `sample` (one base coeff): if input pending OR output empty, duplex; then POP
    THE OUTPUT BUFFER FROM THE END (`Vec::pop`).
  * `sample_bits b`: `sample().as_canonical_u64() & ((1<<b)-1)`.

/-! ## 1b. The CONCRETE FRI query core — Merkle-path recompute + the fold-chain.

This is NOT a record of opaque checks: the per-query FRI verification is a fixed
computation, and it is SPECIFIED here. The verifier, for each query, (i) recomputes
the Poseidon2 Merkle root from the opened leaf + siblings and compares to the layer
commitment, and (ii) walks the fold-chain — each layer's opening must equal the
value the previous layer FOLDED to (`foldCombine beta x e0 e1`), bottoming out at
the FRI final polynomial (a CONSTANT under `log_final_poly_len = 0`, the deployed
`ir2_leaf_wrap_config`). The Poseidon2 compression `compress` and the exact arity-2
fold formula `foldCombine` (the coset `1/(2x)` twiddle) are the calibration the
transcript fixture pins; the verifier's STRUCTURE around them is concrete Lean.

The Merkle binding lemma (`merkleRecompute_binds`) is the anti-forgery tooth: under
the Poseidon2-CR carrier (`compress` injective) the opening BINDS the leaf — no two
leaves recompute the same root at the same query position. -/

/-- The Poseidon2 leaf-compression injectivity the Merkle binding rests on — the
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` carrier (`Dregg2/Circuit/Poseidon2Binding.lean`) in the shape
the path recompute needs: `compress` is 2-to-1 injective on its inputs. NAMED, never
an axiom.

⚠ **BROKEN AS NAMED — FALSE at deployed parameters, so `merkleRecompute_binds` below is VACUOUSLY
TRUE there** (`Circuit.FriCompressRegrounded.compressInjective_false_of_digest_width`;
`docs/deos/VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2). The refutation's whole hypothesis is a FINITE field plus a
CONSTANT output length (`w = 8 = DIGEST_ELEMS`) — nothing about Poseidon2's algebra is needed. It
inherits the defect from the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` carrier it names, which `HashFloorHonesty` had
ALREADY proved false.

**The honest replacement is `Circuit.FriCompressRegrounded`** — `merkleRecompute_binds_advantage_bound`,
from a REAL Merkle-opening-forgery game (tied to the deployed `merkleVerify` accepting BOTH leaves
against one root) via `peelPath`, a CONSTRUCTIVE extractor that walks the forged opening and returns
the first genuine `compress` collision — so this injectivity STEP is replaced by the extraction it was
standing in for. This def is KEPT so the record and the teeth keep compiling. -/
def CompressInjective (compress : List F → List F → List F) : Prop :=
  ∀ a b c d, compress a b = compress c d → a = c ∧ b = d

/-- Merkle-path recompute: fold the opened `leaf` up through the `siblings`,
branching on each index bit (`idx` even ⇒ `acc` is the left input to `compress`),
exactly as a Poseidon2 `MerkleTreeMmcs` opening recomputes the root. `compress` is
the `TruncatedPermutation`. Structural recursion on `siblings`. -/

/-- **The Merkle binding (anti-forgery) tooth.** Under `CompressInjective` (the
Poseidon2-CR carrier), two leaves that recompute the SAME root at the SAME query
index over the SAME sibling path are equal — an attacker cannot open a query to a
forged value. Proven by induction on the path; rests ONLY on the named compress
injectivity. -/

the batched AIRs (the three primitive tables Const/Public/Alu + the four NPO tables
Poseidon2-w16 / Poseidon2-w24 / recompose / expose_claim) the verifier opens, at the
Fiat-Shamir out-of-domain point `ζ`: the folded AIR constraint value `constraintEval`
(the random-linear-combined constraint polynomial at the opened row pair `(ζ, ζ·g)`),
the quotient opening `quotientAtZeta`, the claimed vanishing value `vanishingAtZeta`
(`ζ^{2^degreeBits} − 1`), the table's `degreeBits` (and the VK-pinned
`expectedDegreeBits` it must equal — the range-table `LIMB_BITS` pin), and this
table's net contribution `logupCumSum` to the logup interaction bus. The soundness
content: `constraintEval = vanishingAtZeta · quotientAtZeta` (the quotient identity —
a tampered quotient fails it), `vanishingAtZeta + 1 = ζ^{2^degreeBits}` (the vanishing
is genuinely recomputed, not trusted), and the bus sums to zero across tables. -/

The Fiat-Shamir derivation (`deriveFri`/`deriveQueryIndices`) is SPECIFIED
concretely — it is where a transcript bug hides. The FRI-core per-query check
(Merkle recompute + fold-chain + final-poly constant) is ALSO concrete (§1b),
wired in via `concreteFriChecks`, which additionally BINDS the query positions to
the transcript-derived indices `qidx` — the soundness-critical link that makes the

/-! ## 3b. The CONCRETE batch-STARK constraint checks — `batchTables` + `queryPow`.

The two `FriChecks` fields the prior lane parked as opaque record stubs
(`batchTables`, `queryPow`) are SPECIFIED here as real algorithms, closing the §5
roadmap step 4. The batch-STARK verifier, at the Fiat-Shamir out-of-domain point `ζ`,
for each batched AIR (`verify_all_tables` → `p3_batch_stark::verify_batch`,
`batch_stark_prover.rs:1589`):

  * recomputes the vanishing polynomial `Z_H(ζ) = ζ^{2^degreeBits} − 1` and checks the
    QUOTIENT IDENTITY `C(ζ) = Z_H(ζ) · q(ζ)` — the folded AIR constraint at the OOD
    point equals the vanishing times the opened quotient (a tampered quotient breaks
    it); written `vanishingAtZeta + 1 = ζ^{2^degreeBits}` (semiring, no subtraction)
    + `constraintEval = vanishingAtZeta · quotientAtZeta`;
  * pins each table's `degreeBits` to the VK-expected value (the range-table
    `LIMB_BITS` pin — `verify_vm_descriptor2` checks `degree_bits[byte] == LIMB_BITS`);
  * checks the LOGUP INTERACTION BUS balances — the per-table cumulative sums net to
    zero across all tables (`p3_lookup::logup::LogUpGadget`; sends = receives);
  * checks the query-PoW witness wire shape. Its cryptographic condition is necessarily
    transcript-dependent and lives in `FriChallengerUnified.queryPowCheckUnified`.

These are real Boolean functions of the proof data, parameterized by a `FieldArith`
op bundle (the field `+`/`*`/`^`/`0`/`1`, mirroring how `FriCore` abstracts the
Poseidon2 `compress` + the arity-2 `foldCombine`; the ring ops stay explicit rather
than silently selecting a field instance). The soundness-relevant
TEETH are proven: a tampered quotient, a wrong degree-bit, an unbalanced bus, and a
missing PoW wire each REJECT here; transcript-bound bad PoW rejects in the unified
module. They are NOT opaque verdicts and NOT `sorry`. -/

/-- The field arithmetic the batch-table constraint check needs — the additive group
`(add, zero)`, the multiplication `mul`, the powering `pow` (for the vanishing
recompute `ζ^{2^db}`), and `one`. Carried as a record (the module is import-free),
exactly as `FriCore` carries `compress`/`foldCombine`. -/

/-! ## 4. The carriers + the refinement statement (the payoff).

The wrap rests on the SAME floor as the existing apex: FRI low-degree soundness +
Poseidon2 CR. Both are NAMED carriers (Prop classes), never `axiom`s. The gnark
refinement is an explicit OBLIGATION (discharged fixture-anchored, roadmap §6); the
composition `wrap_sound` is PROVEN. -/

`Satisfied2` / `DecodedStep` witness; modeled opaquely here — the wrap inherits
whatever the floor extracts). -/

/-- **`FriLowDegreeSound` — the NAMED TERMINAL CRYPTO CARRIER** (FRI soundness),
the analogue of `StarkSound` now stated over the SPECIFIED `verifyAlgo`: a proof the
verifier ACCEPTS yields a genuine extractable witness whose published segment is the
carried publics. We do NOT prove this — it is the FRI low-degree-test soundness +
the public-input binding, carried as a Prop class exactly as `metatheory/docs/
STARK-FLOOR.md` carries `StarkSound`. -/

on every fold-commitment / final-poly stream. A bit-exact squeeze divergence here is
the "silent soundness break"; pinning it to the Lean `deriveFri` is the load-bearing
fidelity statement (anchored by a Poseidon2-w16 fixture, ETH-NATIVE-WRAP §3/§4). -/

spec, then under the named FRI carrier a gnark-accepted proof yields a genuine
transition whose segment is the carried publics. The gnark circuit INHERITS the
spec's soundness the instant it refines the spec — the wrap's "silent soundness
break" is exactly the refinement equality, here discharged into the established
FRI floor. Proven (no `sorry`): rewrite `gnark = verifyAlgo`, apply the carrier. -/

/-! ## 5. Executable non-vacuity (the `#guard` discipline).

A toy concrete instance over `Nat` witnessing the §1b FRI core is NON-VACUOUS and
the teeth BITE: an honest single-layer query ACCEPTS; a tampered final constant, a
no-layers query, a query index that disagrees with the transcript, and a wrong query
count all REJECT. These `#guard`s evaluate the real `friQueryCheck` /
`concreteFriChecks`, so they fail the build if the algorithm drifts. -/

/-! ## 6. Transcript fidelity against the p3-challenger REFERENCE vectors.

The load-bearing keystone (`docs/deos/FRI-VERIFIER-PROOF-ENGINEERING.md §4`) is that
the Lean `Challenger` reproduces the deployed `DuplexChallenger` byte-for-byte. The
upstream p3-challenger crate ships its OWN unit-test vectors over a `reverse`
permutation (`duplex_challenger.rs` `test_duplex_challenger`,
`test_output_buffer_pops_correctly`, WIDTH 24 / RATE 16). We replay those EXACT
vectors through the Lean model: if the model diverged from the reference
implementation, these `#guard`s would fail the build. This is a genuine
cross-implementation fidelity check on the transcript engine (not a self-fixture) —
the first concrete rung of the `TranscriptRefines` obligation. These vectors exercise
the Challenger LOGIC (observe/duplex/sample/pop-from-end) over a `reverse` stand-in
permutation; the REAL `Poseidon2BabyBear<16>` hash itself — the actual round constants,
the `MDSMat4` external layer, the `(1+Diag(V))` internal shift-diagonal, the `x^7`
S-box — is implemented and KAT-validated bit-exact against the deployed Rust permute in
the sibling `Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2BabyBearW16` (milestone 2 of the §5 roadmap). The
remaining rung is wiring the two together: a Rust `DuplexChallenger`-with-real-Poseidon2
transcript KAT to pin `TranscriptRefines` against the real hash (the reference-vector
check above already pins the Challenger algorithm; the sibling pins the permutation).

`sampleVec n` collects `n` base squeezes (`= sampleExt`'s coefficient list). -/

the first 12 lanes, permute = reverse, refill output from `state[..16]`), and 16

`state_after_duplexing[..16].reverse = [8,9,10,11, 0x12]`. -/
