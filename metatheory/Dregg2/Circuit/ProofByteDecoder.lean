# Dregg2.Circuit.ProofByteDecoder — a REAL byte→field-view decoder for the deployed
public-input wire, discharging one leg of `CircuitSoundness.cfgView`'s opacity.

## What `cfgView` is (the opacity this file bites)

`CircuitSoundness.cfgView : BatchPublicInputs → BatchProof → (BatchProofData ℤ × WrapPublics ℤ)`
is declared `opaque` — the byte-deserialization of a proof's `(pi, π)` bytes into the
structured field-element views the verifier walks. Its ONLY specification was the
docstring KAT claim; nothing in Lean actually PARSED the deployed byte layout.

This module builds a concrete, executable byte→field decoder for the ONE piece of the
`cfgView` output that IS a plain base-field-element stream on the deployed wire: the
**public-input segment** — `WrapPublics.segment` (the IVC root's carried
`[genesis_root…, final_root…, num_turns, chain_digest…]`, `ivc_turn_chain.rs:1296`) and,
by the tooth-3 identity `exposedSegment = WrapPublics`, `BatchProofData.exposedSegment`.

## The deployed byte layout (the anchor — NOT invented)

The wire is the canonical fixed-width layout the deployed prover emits for a field
public-input vector, read directly from the deployed Rust:

  * `turn/src/binding_proof.rs:70` `public_inputs_babybear`: the PI vector is
    `Vec<u32>` mapped to field elements via `BabyBear::new(v)`;
  * `circuit/src/field.rs:114` `BabyBear::new(v) = Self(v % BABYBEAR_P)` — reduce mod
    `p = 2^31 − 2^27 + 1 = 2013265921` (the canonical, malleability-closing decode, the
    SAME reduction the serde `Deserialize` impl at `field.rs:82` performs);
  * `turn/src/binding_proof.rs:81-89` `hash_into`: the canonical byte encoding is a
    `u64`-LE length prefix (`(len as u64).to_le_bytes()`) followed by each element as a
    4-byte `u32`-LE limb (`v.to_le_bytes()`). This is the layout folded into `Turn::hash`
    (blake3) — load-bearing, not decorative.

So the decoder here is byte-EXACT with the deployed `hash_into` public-input sub-layout
and the `BabyBear::new` field reduction, and its golden vector is the deployed test
vector `vec![0xDEAD_BEEF, 0xCAFE_F00D]` (`binding_proof.rs:191`).

## What this discharges vs. the NAMED residual

DISCHARGES: `cfgView`'s opacity for the `(pi/π bytes) → WrapPublics.segment /
BatchProofData.exposedSegment` leg — a real `parse ∘ encode = id` roundtrip + a golden
vector pinned to the deployed serializer, replacing the docstring-only KAT claim on that
leg with executable, kernel-checked bytes.

The second half of this file now parses the exact leading `BatchProof` field of the
postcard-serialized
`p3_circuit_prover::BatchStarkProof<DreggRecursionConfig>`.  Serde emits struct fields
in declaration order and postcard emits unsigned integers and sequence lengths in
base-128 varint form.  The parser follows the deployed nested types all the way through
`BatchCommitments`, `BatchOpenedValues`, `FriProof`, every `QueryProof`/Merkle opening,
global lookup data, and `degree_bits`.  It therefore extracts the trace and quotient
caps, flattened OOD openings, FRI caps, final polynomial, query-PoW witness, and the
per-query `log_arity` schedule from real proof bytes.

NAMED reconstruction residual (not axiomatized): postcard does NOT serialize query
indices, FRI betas, fold-domain points, the OOD point ζ, AIR constraint evaluations,
vanishing inverses, or recomposed table openings.  The native verifier reconstructs
those from the continued Fiat-Shamir transcript, domains, AIRs, and the parsed opened
values.  Consequently `decodeInnerProofCorePrefix` fills only literal wire fields;
`queries`, `oodPoint`, `tableOpenings`, and `singleAirOpenings` stay empty until that
verifier-side reconstruction is modeled.  The enclosing `BatchStarkProof` metadata
(`table_packing` through `stark_common`, including its optional preprocessed cap) is
also the unconsumed suffix, returned explicitly rather than silently accepted.  These
are the named `InnerProofReconstructionResidual` and `BatchStarkMetadataTailResidual`.
`readVarNat_encodeVarNat` proves the general postcard scalar/length roundtrip and
`readBatchProofCore_golden` pins the complete nested cursor.  A whole-core
encode/decode theorem is the named `CoreProjectionRoundtripResidual`: this decoder
intentionally consumes but does not retain authentication paths and lookup names, so
its `BatchProofData` projection is not injective and cannot honestly be re-encoded.

## Axiom hygiene

Every theorem is `#assert_axioms`-clean (omega + structural induction only). No `sorry`,
no `native_decide`, no new axiom. `#guard`s kernel-reduce over concrete deployed bytes;
`#eval`s exhibit non-vacuity. NEW file; imports read-only.

The deployed test vector is `public_inputs = vec![0xDEAD_BEEF, 0xCAFE_F00D]`

  * count `2` as `u64`-LE: `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`;

The p3 `MontyField31` serde implementation writes its *Montgomery-form* `u32` as a
postcard varint and rejects values `≥ p` on decode.  `R = 2^32 mod p = 268435454` and
`R⁻¹ mod p = 943718400`; multiplying by the latter converts the wire word back to the
canonical field representative consumed by the Lean challenger. -/
