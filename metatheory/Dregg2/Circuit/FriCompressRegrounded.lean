# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriCompressRegrounded` — the `CompressInjective` consumer RE-GROUNDED off the
FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floor onto a REAL Merkle-forgery game carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `CompressInjective` site)

`FriVerifier.CompressInjective compress := ∀ a b c d, compress a b = compress c d → a = c ∧ b = d` is
stated as **injectivity** of the Poseidon2 `TruncatedPermutation` — the 2-to-1 Merkle node compression.
`List F × List F` is INFINITE and the deployed compression emits a FIXED-WIDTH digest over a FINITE
field (`DIGEST_ELEMS` BabyBear lanes), so the floor is **FALSE at deployed parameters by pigeonhole**
(§1, `compressInjective_false_of_finite_range` / `compressInjective_false_of_digest_width`). Two field
elements do not fit in one without collision — that is what "compression" MEANS. The one consumer
conditioned on it, `merkleRecompute_binds` (the module's own "anti-forgery tooth"), is therefore
**VACUOUSLY TRUE** at real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proof is clean; the HYPOTHESIS is
the flaw.

The carrier's docstring calls it "the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` carrier … NAMED, never an axiom". Naming is
not the issue: `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is itself proved FALSE for a range-bounded sponge by
`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`, and this is the same predicate one arity down.
Collision-resistance says collisions are hard to FIND, never that they do not EXIST.

## The re-grounding (the `PreRotationKeySetRegrounded` pattern)

  * **§1 — FALSE AS NAMED.** The counting core (`HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range`) fires
    through the pair-flattening `fun p => compress p.1 p.2`, exactly as
    `HashFloorHonesty.compressInjective_false_of_finite_range` does for `StateCommit.compressInjective`;
    `compressInjective_false_of_digest_width` is the deployed form (a `Finite` field + a fixed digest
    width is all it takes).
  * **§2 — the KEYED family.** `CompressDeployment` bundles the deployed compression with its
    domain-separation tag space (the effective key — the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model), keyed on
    the PAIR domain so the family's `Input` is the compression's real 2-to-1 domain.
    `deployed_compress_is_family_instance` and `collisionGame_wins_iff` pin FAITHFULNESS.
  * **§3 — the MERKLE-FORGERY GAME.** Handed a sampled tag, the adversary outputs two leaves, a sibling
    path and a query index; it WINS iff the leaves are DISTINCT yet `merkleRecompute` (the REAL deployed
    recompute) carries both to the SAME root at that index over that path. That IS a Merkle opening
    forgery — a query opened to a value the committed tree does not contain — and it is what
    `merkleRecompute_binds` rules out. IN the win relation, not in a docstring.
  * **§4 — THE REDUCTION, AND IT PEELS THE WHOLE PATH.** `peelPath` walks the forged opening level by
    level and RETURNS the first genuine `compress` collision: at each level the two accumulators enter
    `compress` against the SAME sibling, so either the outputs already collide on distinct inputs (the
    collision, returned) or the outputs stay distinct and the walk descends with the invariant intact.
    `peelPath_wins` is that induction — the DUAL of `merkleRecompute_binds`'s, at the same recursion
    over the path, with the injectivity step replaced by the extraction it was hiding.
    `merkle_adv_le` is the advantage inequality by `winProb_le_of_imp`. Nothing is stated at the
    one-step level; the full path is peeled.
  * **§5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMER.** `merkleRecompute_binds_advantage_bound`: the Boolean "two leaves
    that recompute to the same root ARE equal" becomes "an attacker opens a query to a forged value only
    with negligible probability", from the collision floor VIA the reduction.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETER IS THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND IT IS UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the UNRESTRICTED
adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, so it is FALSE wherever collisions exist — and §1
proves they exist at any fixed-width compression. §7 instantiates both poles at THIS carrier:
`compress_floor_top_false_of_compressing` (`Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at deployed parameters) and
`compress_floor_bot_vacuous` (`Eff := ⊥` is vacuous). So `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the open, at every use
site: this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow imitation would be another
costume. Hiding the `Eff` dependence is the disease; naming it is the repair.

## Non-fake

The floor is REFUTABLE (`brokenCompress_floor_top_false`: a compression that ignores its inputs has a
finder winning at every tag, advantage `1`) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary: the keystone
does NOT follow from the floor applied at some OTHER finder). The OLD `merkleRecompute_binds` is KEPT
untouched in `FriVerifier`; its sibling is ADDED here. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh
`axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the FRI/Merkle `compress` lane. The `STATE_COMMIT` tree carrier is the same shape and is
re-grounded in `Spike.CommitTreeRegrounded`; the pre-rotation key-set carrier is
`Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`.

/-! ## §1 — FALSE AS NAMED: the injective `CompressInjective` floor is refuted by the deployed
compression.

`CompressInjective compress` says the 2-to-1 map `(a, b) ↦ compress a b` is injective on the INFINITE
`List F × List F`. The deployed `TruncatedPermutation` emits a FIXED-WIDTH digest over a FINITE field,
so its range is finite and the counting core fires — no Poseidon2 collision need be exhibited;
cardinality suffices, and is the honest statement. -/

`HashFloorHonesty.finite_range_of_field_bound` for a DIGEST-valued (rather than felt-valued) hash —

/-- **TOOTH — `CompressInjective` is FALSE for any range-bounded 2-to-1 compression.** Literally the
counting core, routed through the pair-flattening `fun p => compress p.1 p.2` — the same route
`HashFloorHonesty.compressInjective_false_of_finite_range` takes for `StateCommit.compressInjective`,
this being the identical predicate at the identical arity. The `a = c ∧ b = d` conclusion of the floor
is exactly injectivity of the flattened map, so the floor hands the counting core its hypothesis. -/

`TruncatedPermutation` over a FINITE field emitting a FIXED digest width (`DIGEST_ELEMS` BabyBear lanes)
refutes the floor. Nothing about Poseidon2's algebra is needed: a finite alphabet and a constant output
length are the whole hypothesis, and every real Merkle node compression has both. The floor is not
merely un-proven at the deployed hash; it is provably FALSE there, so `merkleRecompute_binds` is vacuous
at real parameters. -/

/-! ## §2 — the KEYED family: domain separation is the key.

The deployed `TruncatedPermutation` is a FIXED unkeyed function; its effective key is the
domain-separation tag / parameter regime the Poseidon2 instance is instantiated at. Modelling that tag
as the key is the standard keyed-from-unkeyed treatment (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1-§2) and is what stops
the "hardcode a known collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed floor. -/

/-- **The deployed Merkle node compression.** `compress` is the tag-keyed `TruncatedPermutation` (the
deployed fixed function at each domain-separation tag); `Tag` is the finite, inhabited tag space the CR
game samples; `deployedTag` is the tag the FRI verifier's `MerkleTreeMmcs` computes under. `fieldDecEq`
is the field's decidable equality — the real BabyBear has it, and both the game (which checks two leaves
are distinct) and the extractor (which detects the level the collision lands on) need it. -/

domain-separation tag, on its REAL 2-to-1 domain `List F × List F`. This is the object
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` is realized at for the real Merkle node hash. -/

/-- **FAITHFULNESS.** The deployed FIXED compression IS the keyed family's instance at the deployed tag
— a definitional equality, no idealization. So the CR game below is a game about the very function the
FRI verifier's Merkle recompute calls. -/

/-- **THE OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE.** If the injective `CompressInjective` held at every tag it
would discharge `CollisionResistant (compressFamily D)` (no collisions ⟹ every finder's advantage `0`).
So the OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE at the
deployed compression (§1), it was an EMPTY hypothesis. Nothing is lost re-grounding; a false hypothesis
is replaced by one a real hash can satisfy. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE REDUCTION: a Merkle forger IS a compression collision finder, and the WHOLE PATH is
peeled.

This is the part the OLD carrier hid. `merkleRecompute_binds` induces over the path and, at every level,
SPENDS the injectivity hypothesis to walk the equality back down. Injectivity is false, so that proof
buys nothing at deployed parameters. The same induction run the other way EXTRACTS: at each level the
two accumulators are compressed against the SAME sibling on the SAME side (the index bit is shared —
both leaves are opened at the same query index), so at each level either the digests already agree on
distinct inputs — a genuine collision, RETURNED — or they disagree, and the walk descends with "the
accumulators are distinct" restored. The path is finite, and the root equality at the bottom forbids the
walk from descending forever with distinct accumulators. So the collision is always found. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR.** Walk the forged opening from the leaves toward the root, at each level pairing
each accumulator with the shared sibling on the side the index bit selects, and RETURN the first level
whose two `compress` inputs already agree in output. If none does, the walk descends on the two (now
distinct) digests. The `[]` case is unreachable under a winning forgery (`peelPath_wins`'s `nil` branch
discharges it: with no path the recompute IS the leaf, so equal roots means equal leaves) and returns a
degenerate pair rather than inventing one.

Structural recursion on the path — the SAME recursion `merkleRecompute`/`merkleRecompute_binds` run
on. -/

/-- **⚑ THE EXTRACTION — the full path peel, and this IS `merkleRecompute_binds` inverted.**

From DISTINCT leaves that recompute to the SAME root, `peelPath` returns a GENUINE `compress` collision:
two distinct input pairs with equal digests. The induction is `merkleRecompute_binds`'s, over the same
path, at the same index arithmetic — with the step that CONSUMED `hinj` replaced by the extraction
`hinj` was standing in for. The `nil` case is where the two proofs meet: there the recompute is the
identity, so equal roots force equal leaves, contradicting distinctness; `merkleRecompute_binds` reads
that as its base case, this reads it as the reason the walk cannot run off the end of the path.

Nothing here is stated at the one-step level and nothing is assumed about `compress`. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMER.

The Boolean keystone becomes an advantage bound, derived FROM the collision floor VIA the reduction. The
old statement is kept in `FriVerifier`; this is its honest sibling. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `FriVerifier.merkleRecompute_binds`.**

Under the compression-collision floor at the game the reduction actually attacks, a Merkle forger whose
extracted finder is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an attacker opens a FRI
query to a forged leaf only with negligible probability. The Boolean "two leaves that recompute the same
root at the same index over the same path ARE equal" becomes "are equal EXCEPT with negligible
probability" — which is what a real Poseidon2 can actually deliver, and what the FALSE injective floor
was standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the
forgery game, the hypothesis about the collision game, and `merkle_adv_le` is the only bridge (§6's
canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **`hEff` IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard "the reduction is efficient"
side condition, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The floor's honesty is
exactly its `Eff`'s, and §7 prices both poles: `⊤` makes it FALSE at the deployed compression, `⊥`
vacuous. -/

/-! ## §6 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystone goes RED. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floor applied at some OTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the forger's negligibility from the collision floor applied at some OTHER
finder `B`, NOT the one extracted by peeling its path — and the proof does not go through: the floor
bounds `B`, and only `merkle_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED finder to the forgery game. Under the OLD
free hypothesis (`hinj : CompressInjective compress`, hypothesis and conclusion sharing the same free
`compress`) this tooth was unwritable. It compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the
games. -/

  fail_if_success
    (have : Negl (gameAdv (merkleForgeryGame D) A) := hcol B hB)
  trivial

/-- **THE POSITIVE POLE — the RIGHT floor DOES discharge it.** A gate that refuses everything is a
broken keystone, not a fixed one. With the collision floor at the EXTRACTED finder the keystone fires.
Refusal is discrimination only if acceptance still happens. -/

/-! ## §7 — the `Eff` parameter, PRICED: both poles proved at THIS carrier.

The sweep's deep result (`FloorGames` §2) says a game floor at the unrestricted class IS the existence
floor. Here is that theorem instantiated at the deployed compression, so a reader can price any `Eff`
exactly rather than take the residual on faith. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` for the DEPLOYED compression.)** The real content, and
the reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded compression HAS a collision at every tag (§1's
counting core), so the collision game is always solvable, so the floor at the unrestricted adversary
class is FALSE — and every consumer would be vacuous there. `Classical.choice` is the adversary and no
restatement of the win relation can see it coming. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem
instead of a promise. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the deployed fixed-digest-width form of the same.)** A genuine Poseidon2
`TruncatedPermutation` over a finite field, emitting a constant digest width, refutes the
unrestricted-class floor. The deployment the carrier's docstring names is exactly where `Eff := ⊤`
fails. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the OTHER pole: `Eff := ⊥` is vacuous.)** At the empty adversary class the floor holds for
ANY deployment, including a completely broken compression. Recorded HONESTLY: a satisfiability witness is
worth nothing without the refutation beside it, and these two poles together are what make `Eff` a dial
rather than a costume. -/

/-! ### The floor is REFUTABLE on a broken deployment (load-bearing, not `True`-shaped). -/

distinct input pairs collides at every tag. -/

  tagFintype := inferInstance
  tagNonempty := inferInstance
  compress := fun _ _ _ => []

  deployedTag := ()

/-- **(TOOTH — the floor is REFUTABLE.)** The broken deployment's collision game is solvable at every tag
(`([0], []) ≠ ([1], [])`, both compressing to `[]`), so it has no unrestricted-class floor. So the floor
is a GENUINE constraint — a broken compression refutes it — not vacuously true. -/

    (fun _ _ => ⟨(([0], []), ([1], [])), by simp, rfl⟩)

/-- **(TOOTH — the broken deployment ALSO forges a Merkle opening.)** The refutation is not confined to
the collision game: under a compression that ignores its inputs, two DISTINCT leaves recompute to the
same root over a one-level path, so the forgery game is solvable too — the attack the re-grounded
keystone bounds is REAL, and a broken hash performs it. -/

/-! ### The floor is SATISFIABLE (the connection to the keyed-family treatment). -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the keyed family is SATISFIABLE on an injective deployment.)** A deployment whose per-tag
compression is injective discharges `CollisionResistant (compressFamily D)` — the honest floor is
REALIZABLE, unlike the injective `CompressInjective` at deployed parameters. ⚑ Recorded with its price:
this is the `⊤`-class object, which §7's first tooth proves FALSE at a fixed-width (i.e. real)
compression. An injective compression is exactly the toy-hash shape; the satisfiability is honest only as
a non-emptiness check, never as evidence the deployed Poseidon2 satisfies it. -/
