# Dregg2.Circuit.FloorsNonVacuousWave — the per-effect `*TraceReadout` carriers are NON-VACUOUS.

## The gap this closes (sin-audit a6f7fa16)

Each effect's `<e>_descriptorRefines_sat` rung takes a `<E>TraceReadout` as a PREMISE. The readouts are
the genuine `WitnessDecodes`-class extraction (the committed limb IS the kernel field, by trace-fill
construction) — but they entered the rungs UN-WITNESSED. A premise that is secretly UNINHABITABLE makes
its consuming refinement rung VACUOUSLY satisfiable. `FloorsNonVacuous.lean` covers the five APEX carriers
(`Poseidon2SpongeCR`/`ChipTableSoundN`/`Satisfied2Faithful`/`EffAuthoritySource`/`StarkComplete`); this
module extends the discipline to the per-effect `<E>TraceReadout` structures.

Per readout we construct a CONCRETE inhabiting term: a two-row trace whose designated active row carries
the selector hot and the committed limb the decode-seam reads, a `RotTableSide` table half reusing the
faithful chip/range tables (`FloorsNonVacuous.faithfulTf`), a `pre = post` boundary so every frame field
is `rfl`, and the guard discharged at a self-targeted live cell (`actor = cell` ⇒ self-authority
`troa_lrefl`; `lifecycle = 0` ⇒ Live ⇒ `acceptsEffects`). The decode seam (committed limb = kernel
field) is realized by setting the kernel field to the value the chosen column carries — exactly the
trace-fill identity the deployed prover establishes by construction.

So each `<E>TraceReadout` is `Nonempty`: its consuming rung is NON-vacuous (the premise is satisfiable,
not secretly empty).

/-! ## §0 — the shared table side: a `RotTableSide` over the faithful chip/range tables.

Every readout carries (directly or via `RotTableSide`) the table FAITHFULNESS the rotated denotation
needs. We reuse `FloorsNonVacuous.faithfulTf` (`.poseidon2 = genuineChipTbl` is genuinely
`ChipTableSoundN permOutZ`, `.range = rangeRows BAL_LIMB_BITS`). A trace whose `tf` IS `faithfulTf`
therefore satisfies `RotTableSide permOutZ hash` for any `hash` that reads lane-0 of `permOutZ`. -/

/-! ## §1 — `CellSealTraceReadout` INHABITED.

The designated active row 0 carries `SEL_CELLSEAL = 1` and an all-zero after-disc limb; the boundary is
`pre = post` with `lifecycle = fun _ => 0` (so the seam reads `post.lifecycle cell = 0`, matching the
zero limb), the guard is self-authority at the live cell (`actor = cell`), every frame field is `rfl`,
and the receipt log advances by one. -/

  fun c => if c = SEL_CELLSEAL then 1 else 0

/-- The boundary: a single self-targeted live cell `0`, everything else default. `lifecycle = fun _ => 0`
