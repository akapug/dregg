# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementLifecycleDisc — WAVE 1 of the record-digest split-reshape:
  the lifecycle-DISCRIMINANT sub-limb + the per-effect disc-transition gates that make a
  ledgerless light client UNFOOLABLE on the lifecycle movers.

## The LIVE forgery this closes (light-client)

The lifecycle movers — `cellSeal`/`cellUnseal`/`cellDestroy`/`receiptArchive` — change the cell's
lifecycle. Their deployed descriptors (`rotateV3WithRecordPin B_LIFECYCLE …`) weld the AFTER-lifecycle
limb (`B_LIFECYCLE = 29`, the folded `lifecycle_felt = hash(disc ‖ payload)`, `rotation_witness.rs:110`)
to a FREE public input PI[38] that the deployed verifier anchors from the TRUSTED post-cell
(`proof_verify.rs:253-303`, `lifecycle_felt_cell(post)`). That anchor is a FULL-NODE check: it consumes
the trusted ledger post-cell. For a LEDGERLESS LIGHT CLIENT PI[38] is free, so a prover can publish a
lifecycle limb encoding ANY post-lifecycle — freeze a seal (after-disc stays Live), resurrect a
Destroyed cell, or claim Archived instead of Sealed — and `verifyBatch` alone accepts it. The
lifecycle TRANSITION is unforced.

## Why a separate DISC sub-limb (the minimal close)

`lifecycle_felt` folds `disc ‖ payload` into one OPAQUE felt — you cannot gate the disc inside it (it is
a hash output). But the light-client-meaningful safety property is precisely the DISCRIMINANT TRANSITION:

  * `cellSeal`        : `before_disc = Live(0)`     ∧ `after_disc = Sealed(1)`
  * `cellUnseal`      : `before_disc = Sealed(1)`   ∧ `after_disc = Live(0)`
  * `cellDestroy`     : `after_disc = Destroyed(3)` ∧ `before_disc ≠ Destroyed` (NO resurrection)
  * `receiptArchive`  : `after_disc = Archived(4)`

So we COMMIT the lifecycle `disc` (the small `u8 0..4`, `rotation_witness.rs:115`) as its OWN committed
sub-limb beside `lifecycle_felt`, and GATE the per-effect disc transition IN-CIRCUIT. A forged disc
transition (a frozen seal, a Destroyed→Live resurrection) is then UNSAT with NO trusted post-cell.

The PAYLOAD felt (`reason_hash` / `deathCert` / `sealed_at`) STAYS the prover's — it is effect data the
light client reads from the published effect; this forces the DISC, not the payload. (That residual is
NAMED in §6.)

## The binding mechanism (chosen: a dedicated `disc` committed sub-limb — same carrier as `lifecycleRoot`)

`disc : CellId → Nat` is the projection of `k.lifecycle cell` onto its discriminant. Its committed root
`discRoot` is the `ListCommit.listDigest` over the cell's disc entry — EXACTLY the `lifecycleRoot` carrier
(`compressNInjective` Poseidon-CR + an injective leaf), absorbed as ONE more committed sub-limb. NEVER a
fresh axiom, NEVER an `N_SYSTEM_ROOTS` bump. This module reuses `lifecycleLeaf`/`lifecycleLeaf_injective`
from `RotatedKernelRefinementCellSeal` (the disc IS a `Nat`, the same injective `Nat → ℤ` leaf).

## The DEPLOYED disc map (what the light client sees)

The light client sees the DEPLOYED disc transition, which for `receiptArchive` is the side-table move to
`Archived` (the deployed `apply_receipt_archive` → `c.archive`), NOT the kernel-spec record-slot write.
So this module models the DEPLOYED disc side-table `discAfter` per mover and gates IT — the transition a
ledgerless client can be fooled about. (The kernel-spec `ReceiptArchiveSpec` models the record slot; the
two layers diverge on receiptArchive only, recorded in §6 — the deployed disc is what PI[38] carries.)

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} + the realizable Poseidon-CR carrier
(`compressNInjective` + `lifecycleLeaf_injective`, REUSED). No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no `native_decide`,
no fresh axiom. NEW file; all imports read-only.

/-! ## §0 — the deployed lifecycle discriminants + the committed `disc` sub-limb.

`lcLive = 0`, `lcSealed = 1`, `lcDestroyed = 3` come from `TurnExecutorFull`. The deployed circuit also
carries `Migrated = 2` and `Archived = 4` (`rotation_witness.rs:115` — the `u8 0..4`); we add the one the
movers need: `lcArchived := 4` (the deployed `receiptArchive` disc). The committed `disc` sub-limb is
`disc cell := the discriminant of `k.lifecycle cell`` — but at the spec layer `k.lifecycle cell` IS the
discriminant (a `Nat`), so the disc sub-limb's value is exactly `k.lifecycle cell`. Its committed root is
the `lifecycleRoot`-shaped digest over that one entry. -/

/-! ## §1 — the per-effect DISC-transition gate.

The deployed circuit, with the `disc` sub-limb realized, would carry TWO committed disc columns
(before/after) and a gate forcing the disc transition. We model that gate as a predicate on the row's
pre/post disc-root columns AND the before/after discriminant values it pins — at the granularity the
deployed per-effect gate enforces. -/

/-- **`DiscRootRow compressN preK postK cell preRoot postRoot`** — the decode tying the FIX row's two
committed disc-root columns to the kernel pre/post discriminant of `cell`. The PRE column is `discRoot`
of the pre kernel; the POST column is `discRoot` of the post kernel. -/
def DiscRootRow (compressN : List FieldElem → FieldElem)
    (preK postK : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (preRoot postRoot : FieldElem) : Prop :=
  preRoot = discRoot compressN preK cell ∧ postRoot = discRoot compressN postK cell

/-- **`gDiscTransition compressN preK cell before after preRoot postRoot`** — the FIX gate body: the PRE
disc-root column IS the digest of the kernel whose `cell` disc is `before`, AND the POST disc-root column
IS the digest of the kernel whose `cell` disc is `after`. This is what a ledgerless light client's
in-circuit disc gate ENFORCES — both endpoints of the transition, pinned to committed roots (NO trusted
post-cell). -/

/-- **`discAfterForced` — the FIX gate FORCES the committed AFTER disc.** The deployed circuit pins the
after-disc to `after`, so a forged after-disc (the LIVE forgery — a frozen seal, a resurrection) is UNSAT
with NO trusted post-cell. -/

/-! ## §2 — the four lifecycle movers: the per-effect disc-transition decode + the FORCED transition.

Each mover carries its OWN before/after disc pair; the gate forces BOTH endpoints. The `DiscMover` decode
bundles the two committed disc-root columns, their decode, and the gate — the in-circuit cap a ledgerless
client opens. The light-client-meaningful conclusion is the forced TRANSITION (both endpoints), proved
from the gate without any off-circuit anchor. -/

/-- **`DiscMover compressN pre post cell before after`** — the active-row⟷kernel decode for a satisfying
disc-transition witness of `cell` from `before` to `after`. DATA-bearing (`Type`, like
`cellSealGenuineEncodes`): it exhibits the two committed disc-root columns, carries the FIX gate (the
WITNESS leg — the running circuit PINS both endpoints), and is the ONLY thing the light client needs (no
trusted post-cell). -/

/-! ## §6 — the RESIDUAL ledger (carried, NAMED — not faked).

  * **The payload felt stays the PROVER'S.** This gate forces the DISC, not the `reason_hash` /
    `deathCert` / `sealed_at` payload that `lifecycle_felt` also folds. The payload is effect data the
    light client reads from the PUBLISHED effect; forcing it is not a light-client safety property (a
    wrong payload is the prover lying to ITSELF about its own effect, not fooling a verifier about the
    lifecycle STATE). Named, not laundered.

  * **The `disc` sub-limb COMMITMENT realization is ember-gated (a VK epoch).** Realizing this gate on the
    deployed path means COMMITTING the disc beside `lifecycle_felt` in the per-cell commitment
    (`cell_state.rs::compute_commitment`) — either a 33rd `pre_limbs` column or a re-fold of `B_LIFECYCLE`
    to `H(disc_felt, payload_felt)`. Either changes `ROT_WIDTH` / the AFTER-block offsets / all 36 rotated
    descriptor JSONs / the registry fingerprint / the VK — a global flag-day. So the COMMITMENT change is
    the EMBER-GATED deploy step; THIS module proves the gate + teeth against the FIX (committed-root)
    descriptor, the same beachhead shape as `RotatedKernelRefinementCellSeal`/`…Lifecycle`.

  * **Layer divergence on `receiptArchive`.** The KERNEL spec `ReceiptArchiveSpec` writes a record SLOT
    and FREEZES the `lifecycle` side-table (`cellstateaudit.lean:241`); the DEPLOYED `apply_receipt_archive`
    moves the side-table disc to `Archived(4)` (`rotation_witness.rs:460`). The light client sees the
    DEPLOYED disc (PI[38] carries `lifecycle_felt`), so this module gates the DEPLOYED disc transition.
    Reconciling the two layers (one disc semantics) is WAVE-3 work, named here. -/
