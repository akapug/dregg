# Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.bridgeinboundmint — INDEPENDENT full-state spec + executor⟺spec for the
dregg2 effect family **bridge-inbound-mint** (variant: `bridgeMintA` — W1: the BRIDGE-issuer move).

Phase 2 of dregg1's two-phase cross-chain bridge, the INBOUND mint: when the OTHER chain confirms a
lock, this chain credits the recipient with the bridged asset. **W1 (DREGG3 §2.2)**: the BRIDGE cell
IS the issuer of the bridged asset (`AssetId := CellId` — asset `a` = the bridge cell `a`), so the
inbound mint is an ordinary per-asset transfer FROM the bridge's negative-capable well TO the
recipient: the bridge well carries −(outstanding bridged supply) — exactly what this chain owes the
foreign chain — and `Σ_c bal c a` is EXACTLY unchanged. The §8 CryptoPortal hypothesis (the
other-chain confirmation) governs WHEN the bridge may move; conservation holds regardless. The
in-VM gate is the privileged mint authority over the BRIDGE cell (`recCMintAsset` enforces it).

This is a *leaf* module in the `Transfer.lean` lineage (imported by nothing; gated standalone). It
re-derives, INDEPENDENTLY of the executor, the SAME triangle corner the reference
`TransferSpec`/`recKExec_iff_spec`/`recTransfer_correct` establish for `Transfer`. The executor arm
this module specifies is a SINGLE branch:

    execFullA s (.bridgeMintA actor cell a value) = recCMintAsset s actor cell a value

`recCMintAsset` is the chained per-asset mint: it runs the kernel issuer-move `recKMintAsset` and,
on commit, PREPENDS the truthful well→recipient receipt `{actor, src:=a, dst:=cell, amt:=value}`
onto the log. The kernel mint's admissibility guard is the EXACT conjunction (read off the CODE):

    mintAuthorizedB caps actor a = true   -- (1) ISSUER AUTHORITY over the BRIDGE cell (E2)
  ∧ 0 ≤ value                             -- (2) NON-NEGATIVITY
  ∧ a ∈ accounts                          -- (3) BRIDGE-WELL LIVENESS (genesis order)
  ∧ cell ∈ accounts                       -- (4) DESTINATION LIVENESS
  ∧ a ≠ cell                              -- (5) the self-mint no-move is refused

and on commit it produces `some { k with bal := recTransferBal k.bal a cell a value }` — the
issuer-move write: well debited, recipient credited, EVERY other (cell,asset) entry untouched.

## What is proved (the apex reference truth, BOTH directions)

  1. `InboundMintSpec st actor cell a value st'` — the INDEPENDENT declarative full-state
     post-condition: the admissibility guard (`inboundMintAdmit`), the EXACT post-`bal` ledger
     (the issuer-move write), the chained `log` advanced by exactly the truthful receipt, AND the
     FRAME — every OTHER RecordKernelState component LITERALLY unchanged. No frame clause mentions
     the executor.

  2. `recTransferBal_inbound_correct` — the post-`bal` helper validated DECLARATIVELY (the bridge
     well debited by `value`, the `(cell,a)` entry credited by `value`, every other `(c,b)` entry
     literally preserved).

  3. `recCMintAsset_iff_inboundSpec` — the ⟺ on the chained step `recCMintAsset`.
     `execBridgeMintA_iff_spec` — execFullA ⟺ spec for the `bridgeMintA` variant (BOTH directions).

  4. Post-state corollaries: `bridgeMint_credit` (well-debit + recipient-credit + ledger-frame),
     `bridgeMint_supply_delta` (the W1 CONSERVATION CONTENT: a committed inbound mint leaves EVERY
     asset's supply EXACTLY unchanged — the bridge well absorbs the outstanding bridged value),
     `bridgeMint_authorized`, `bridgeMint_nonneg`.

  5. Non-vacuity: `bridgeMint_rejects_unauthorized`, `bridgeMint_rejects_negative`,
     `bridgeMint_rejects_dead_bridge`, `bridgeMint_rejects_dead_cell`, plus `bridgeMint_admits_iff`
     — each forged input fails a guard leg ⇒ the executor returns `none` ⇒ no spec post-state
     exists. Concrete `#guard` witnesses (genuine `decide`, NOT `native_decide`) exhibit a good
     mint committing (the bridge well visibly going negative) and the forgeries decidably rejected.

/-! ## §1 — the admissibility guard, lifted from the CODE.

`recKMintAsset` (W1) commits IFF this exact conjunction holds: the gate target is the **BRIDGE**
cell `a` — the issuer of the bridged asset (`mintAuthorizedB caps actor a`, the privileged
`node`/`control` gate; a forged other-chain confirmation cannot coin value because only the bridge
authority can move the bridge well). -/

/-- **`inboundMintAdmit`** — the full admissibility guard `recKMintAsset` (and so `recCMintAsset`,
the chained step `bridgeMintA` dispatches to) checks, as a `Prop`: BRIDGE-issuer authority ∧
non-negativity ∧ bridge-well liveness ∧ destination liveness ∧ distinctness. -/
def inboundMintAdmit (k : RecordKernelState) (actor cell : CellId) (a : AssetId) (value : ℤ) : Prop :=
  mintAuthorizedB k.caps actor a = true ∧ 0 ≤ value
    ∧ a ∈ k.accounts ∧ cell ∈ k.accounts ∧ a ≠ cell ∧ cellLifecycleLive k a = true

/-- The truthful receipt a committed `bridgeMintA` prepends to the log: the bridge-well → recipient
row of size `value`, exactly `recCMintAsset`'s `log` head. Stated HERE so the spec's `log` clause
does not reference the executor's body. -/
def inboundMintReceipt (actor cell : CellId) (a : AssetId) (value : ℤ) : Turn :=
  { actor := actor, src := a, dst := cell, amt := value }

/-! ## §2 — the post-`bal` helper, validated DECLARATIVELY.

`recTransferBal bal a cell a value` (the issuer-move write) is the ONLY thing a committed inbound
mint does to the ledger. We validate it relationally so the spec's `bal = recTransferBal …` clause
carries real meaning rather than trusting the helper's name. -/

/-- **`recTransferBal_inbound_correct`** — the ledger-update helper validated DECLARATIVELY: an
inbound mint debits the bridge well `(a, a)` by exactly `value`, credits `(cell, a)` by exactly
`value`, and leaves every OTHER (cell,asset) entry literally untouched. Well-debit ∧ credit ∧
ledger-frame. -/
