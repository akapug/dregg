# Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.escrowcommitted — INDEPENDENT full-state spec + executor⟺spec for the
`escrow-committed` (PRIVACY-escrow) effect family: `FullActionA.createCommittedEscrowA` /
`.releaseCommittedEscrowA` / `.refundCommittedEscrowA`.

This is a LEAF module (imported by nothing; gated standalone). It is the `Transfer.lean` reference
pattern (`TransferSpec` + `recKExec_iff_spec` + `recTransfer_correct`) re-derived INDEPENDENTLY for
the §8-portal-GATED committed-escrow effects that the unified action executor `execFullA` dispatches:

    execFullA s (.createCommittedEscrowA id actor creator recipient asset amount hidingProof)
      = createCommittedEscrowChainA s id actor creator recipient asset amount hidingProof  -- :3543
    createCommittedEscrowChainA s id actor creator recipient asset amount hidingProof          -- :2965
      = if hidingProof = true then createEscrowChainA s id actor creator recipient asset amount
        else none
    createEscrowChainA s id actor creator recipient asset amount                                -- :1986
      = match createEscrowKAsset s.kernel id actor creator recipient asset amount with
        | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := escrowReceiptA actor :: s.log } | none => none

    execFullA s (.releaseCommittedEscrowA id actor) = releaseEscrowChainA s id actor             -- :3545
    execFullA s (.refundCommittedEscrowA  id actor) = refundEscrowChainA  s id actor             -- :3546

So the committed-escrow create is the plain per-asset escrow lock (`createEscrowKAsset`,
`RecordKernel.lean:1490`) UNDER an ADDED §8 hiding-portal gate `hidingProof = true` (the executable
boolean shadow of the Pedersen range/opening proof, dregg1 `apply.rs:2125`) — FAIL-CLOSED when the
portal fails, the privacy boundary the plain escrow lacks. The release/refund variants are
dispatch-ALIASED to the plain per-asset escrow settle (`settleEscrowRawAsset`, `RecordKernel.lean:1481`).

## The create admissibility guard (the §8 portal ∧ the per-asset lock guard)

    hidingProof = true                                                            -- (0) §8 HIDING PORTAL
  ∧ authorizedB caps {actor, src:=creator, dst:=recipient, amt:=amount} = true    -- (1) AUTHORITY
  ∧ 0 ≤ amount                                                                     -- (2) NON-NEGATIVITY
  ∧ amount ≤ k.bal creator asset                                                   -- (3) AVAILABILITY in asset
  ∧ creator ∈ k.accounts                                                           -- (4) CREATOR LIVENESS
  ∧ ¬ (∃ r ∈ k.escrows, r.id = id)                                               -- (5) ID FRESHNESS

and on commit it produces `createEscrowRawAsset` (`RecordKernel.lean:1471`):
  * `bal` ledger: a SINGLE-cell, single-asset DEBIT of `amount` from `(creator, asset)`,
  * `escrows` store: PREPEND an unresolved `EscrowRecord {id, creator, recipient, amount,
    resolved:=false, asset}`,
  * EVERY OTHER kernel field (15 of them) and the chained `log` (advanced by `escrowReceiptA actor ::`)
    are the FRAME.

## What is proved (the apex reference truth, BOTH directions)

  * `CommittedEscrowCreateSpec` — the INDEPENDENT declarative full-state post-condition: the §8 portal
    ∧ the per-asset lock guard, the EXACT post-`bal` ledger (`recBalCreditCell … (-amount)`), the EXACT
    post-`escrows` store (the prepended unresolved record), the chained `log` advanced by exactly
    `escrowReceiptA actor ::`, AND the FRAME — every one of the 15 OTHER RecordKernelState components
    LITERALLY unchanged. No frame clause mentions the executor. All 17 kernel components + log enumerated.
  * `createCommittedEscrowKAsset_correct` — the post-state helper (`createEscrowRawAsset`) validated
    DECLARATIVELY (the `bal` debit at `(creator,asset)`, the other-`(cell,asset)` ledger-frame, the
    `escrows` prepend).
  * `createCommittedEscrowChainA_iff_spec` — the ⟺ on the chained step.
  * `execFullA_createCommittedEscrowA_iff_spec` — execFullA ⟺ spec for the create variant (BOTH
    directions). The `→` VALIDATES the executor against the independent spec (all 17 kernel fields + log
    are checked, so a silently mutated field would make the proof FAIL); `←` reconstructs.
  * `CommittedEscrowReleaseSpec` / `CommittedEscrowRefundSpec` + their `execFullA_…_iff_spec` — the
    settle variants' INDEPENDENT full-state specs (find the unresolved record by id, the target+lifecycle
    gate, the single-cell credit + mark-resolved, the FRAME, the log advance), proved BOTH directions.
  * Non-vacuity: the create's PRIVACY-BOUNDARY teeth (`…_rejects_no_hiding`) plus each lock-guard leg
    (`…_rejects_unauthorized`/`…_rejects_negative`/`…_rejects_overdraft`/`…_rejects_dead_creator`/
    `…_rejects_id_reuse`), and the settle's `…_rejects_missing_record`.

/-! ## §1 — the CREATE admissibility guard (§8 portal ∧ the `createEscrowKAsset` `if`).

Exactly the §8 hiding portal `hidingProof = true` (`createCommittedEscrowChainA`'s added `if`,
`TurnExecutorFull.lean:2965`) CONJOINED with the five conjuncts `createEscrowKAsset`
(`RecordKernel.lean:1490`) checks. The portal is the leg plain escrow LACKS — the committed variant is
not byte-identical to plain escrow. -/

/-- The full committed-escrow-create admissibility guard, as a `Prop`: the §8 hiding portal AND the
per-asset lock guard. -/

    ∧ ¬ (∃ r ∈ k.escrows, r.id = id)

/-! ## §2 — the create post-state helper, validated DECLARATIVELY.

`createEscrowRawAsset` (`RecordKernel.lean:1471`) is the post-state the committed create installs once
the portal discharges. We pin EXACTLY what it does — debit `(creator,asset)` by `amount` on the `bal`
ledger (leaving every other `(cell,asset)` untouched) and PREPEND the unresolved record onto `escrows`
— so the spec's `bal`/`escrows` clauses are genuine debit ∧ ledger-frame ∧ park-record. -/

/-- **`createCommittedEscrowKAsset_correct`** — the create post-state helper validated declaratively:
the lock debits `(creator,asset)` by `amount`, leaves every other `(cell,asset)` ledger entry
untouched, and prepends exactly the unresolved record onto the holding-store. -/

/-! ## §3 — FULL-STATE SEMANTIC SPEC of the CREATE (the INDEPENDENT reference) + executor⟺spec.

`CommittedEscrowCreateSpec` is the COMPLETE declarative post-state of a committed
`createCommittedEscrowA`, written INDEPENDENTLY of the executor: the §8 portal AND the lock guard hold;
the post-`bal` ledger is the single-cell single-asset debit; the post-`escrows` store is the prepended
unresolved record; the chained `log` advances by exactly `escrowReceiptA actor ::`; and EVERY OTHER
state component — all 15 non-`bal`, non-`escrows` RecordKernelState fields — is LITERALLY unchanged (the
FRAME). No frame clause references the executor's terms. -/

/-- **The full-state declarative spec of a committed `createCommittedEscrowA`** — the INDEPENDENT
reference semantics. The §8 hiding portal AND the lock guard hold (`createGuard`); the post-`bal` ledger
debits `(creator,asset)` by `amount`; the post-`escrows` store is `parkedRecord :: st.escrows`; the
chained `log` is `escrowReceiptA actor :: st.log`; and every one of the 15 other RecordKernelState
components is unchanged. -/

the §8 portal, all 17 kernel components (`bal` + `escrows` + the 15 frame fields) AND the log are

/-! ## §5 — the SETTLE (release / refund) variants: INDEPENDENT full-state specs + executor⟺spec.

`releaseCommittedEscrowA`/`refundCommittedEscrowA` dispatch to the plain per-asset escrow settle
(`releaseEscrowChainA`/`refundEscrowChainA`, `TurnExecutorFull.lean:3545,3546`), which look up the
unresolved record by `id`, gate on the SETTLE-LIVENESS of the target (`recipient` for release,
`creator` for refund — a LIVE account whose `lifecycle = 0`), then single-cell-credit the target at the
record's asset and mark the record resolved (`settleEscrowRawAsset`, `RecordKernel.lean:1481`, which
touches ONLY `bal` and `escrows`). The §8 release/refund portal is the theorem-layer carrier (same lock
automaton as plain escrow), so the executable settle is the SHARED body — and these specs are stated
over the SETTLE-found record, indexed by the chosen target field. -/

/-- The settle admissibility predicate (release/refund), parameterised by the chosen target picker

`id`, and its picked target is a LIVE account. Stated declaratively over the FOUND record. -/

/-! ## §6 — NON-VACUITY: the executor REJECTS bad inputs (each guard leg, fail-closed).

A spec a worthless executor could meet (accept everything) would be vacuous. Each forged input fails a
guard conjunct ⇒ `execFullA st (.<variant> …) = none` ⇒ no spec post-state exists. The create's
HEADLINE is the §8 PRIVACY-BOUNDARY tooth (`…_rejects_no_hiding`) — the gate plain escrow LACKS. -/

/-- **`committedCreate_rejects_no_hiding` — PROVED (THE PRIVACY-BOUNDARY TEETH).** No committed-escrow
create commits without the §8 hiding portal (`hidingProof = false` ⇒ `none`). This is the gate plain
escrow does NOT have — the committed variant is NOT silently identical to plain escrow. -/
