# Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.notecommitment — INDEPENDENT full-state spec + executor⟺spec for the
dregg2 effect family **note-commitment** (variant: `noteCreateA`).

This is a *leaf* module in the `Transfer.lean` lineage: it builds, for the grow-only fresh-commitment
PUBLISH effect, the SAME triangle corner the reference `TransferSpec`/`recKExec_iff_spec` establish
for `Transfer`, but written INDEPENDENTLY of the executor and at the gated `execFullA`/`RecChainedState`
level (the analog of `Spec.supplycreation`'s `MintASpec`/`execMintA_iff_spec`).

`noteCreateA` is the dual of `noteSpendA`: a `noteSpend` GROWS the `nullifiers` set under a
double-spend GATE (fail-closed on a repeated nullifier), but a `noteCreate` GROWS the `commitments`
SET with NO guard at all — the commitment set is APPEND-ONLY and a fresh commitment cannot conflict
(`apply_note_create`, dregg1). So the executor arm (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3539`) is the TOTAL,
single-branch `some (noteCreateChainA s cm actor)` — there is NO admissibility guard to lift. This is
the *cleanest* possible spec shape: a spec with no guard conjunct, ALWAYS satisfiable.

The deliverables, mirroring the reference pattern (`Dregg2/Circuit/Transfer.lean` §6b /
`Spec/supplycreation.lean`):

  1. `NoteCreateASpec st cm actor st'` : Prop — the FULL declarative post-state of a committed
     `noteCreateA`. It is the conjunction of
       * (NO admissibility guard — `noteCreate` is unconditional; this is the "append-only, no
         double-check" property the prompt calls out, made EXPLICIT as `noteCreateAdmit = True`);
       * the EXACT touched components — `kernel.commitments` PREPENDED with `cm`
         (`cm :: st.kernel.commitments`) and the receipt `log` PREPENDED with the disclosed
         `escrowReceiptA actor` self-edge;
       * EVERY OTHER state component LITERALLY unchanged: all 16 non-`commitments` kernel fields
         (`accounts` `cell` `caps` `escrows` `nullifiers` `revoked` `bal` `queues` `swiss`
         `slotCaveats` `factories` `lifecycle` `deathCert` `delegate` `delegations` `sealedBoxes`)
         — the FRAME. No frame clause mentions any executor helper.
  2. `execNoteCreateA_iff_spec : execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some st' ↔ NoteCreateASpec …`
     — BOTH directions. The `→` VALIDATES the executor against the independent spec: a
     silently-mutated field would make the frame clause unprovable. (None was found — see frameGaps in
     the report.)
  3. `noteCreateCommitment_correct` — the post-`commitments` helper validated DECLARATIVELY (`cm` is
     prepended, the membership grows, and the OLD membership is preserved), so the spec's
     `commitments = cm :: …` clause encodes insert ∧ set-frame, not blind trust.

The companion semantic corollaries pin the content: a committed `noteCreate` INSERTS `cm`
(`noteCreateA_inserts`), PRESERVES every prior commitment (`noteCreateA_preserves`), is balance-NEUTRAL
on every asset (`noteCreateA_bal_neutral`), and — the headline distinguishing it from `noteSpend` —
ALWAYS COMMITS regardless of state (`noteCreateA_total`), the append-only "no double-check" theorem.

/-! ## §1 — the (TRIVIAL) admissibility guard, lifted from the CODE.

`noteCreateA`'s `execFullA` arm (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3539`) is `some (noteCreateChainA s cm actor)`
— a TOTAL function, no `if`. There is NO admissibility guard: the commitment set is APPEND-ONLY and a
fresh commitment cannot conflict (unlike `noteSpendA`, which gates on a fresh nullifier). We make this
EXPLICIT — `noteCreateAdmit = True` — so the spec's shape matches the reference (a guard conjunct that
is always satisfiable) and so the "no double-check" property is a literal field of the spec, not an
implicit omission. -/

/-- **`noteCreateAdmit`** — the admissibility guard a `noteCreateA` checks. It is `True`: the
note-commitment publish is UNCONDITIONAL (append-only commitment set, no double-check). This is the
explicit dual of `noteSpend`'s fail-closed nullifier guard. -/
def noteCreateAdmit : Prop := True

/-- The disclosed receipt a committed `noteCreateA` prepends to the log — the `escrowReceiptA actor`
self-edge `actor → actor` of size `0` (exactly `noteCreateChainA`'s `log` head,
`TurnExecutorFull.lean:2008`/`escrowReceiptA` `:1982`). Balance-neutral, as the effect is. -/
def noteCreateReceipt (actor : CellId) : Turn := escrowReceiptA actor

/-! ## §2 — the post-`commitments` helper, validated DECLARATIVELY.

`noteCreateCommitment k cm = { k with commitments := cm :: k.commitments }` is the ONLY thing a
committed note-create does to the kernel's tracked sets. We validate it relationally (the head is `cm`,
the new set CONTAINS `cm`, and every PRIOR commitment is preserved) so the spec's
`commitments = cm :: …` clause carries real meaning rather than trusting the helper's name. -/

/-- **`noteCreateCommitment_correct`** — the commitment-set helper validated DECLARATIVELY: a
note-create PREPENDS `cm` (so `cm` is now a member), and every PRIOR commitment remains a member (the
set grows, nothing is lost — append-only). So the spec's `commitments = cm :: …` clause
encodes insert ∧ grow-only-frame. -/
theorem noteCreateCommitment_correct (k : RecordKernelState) (cm : Nat) :
    (noteCreateCommitment k cm).commitments = cm :: k.commitments
    ∧ cm ∈ (noteCreateCommitment k cm).commitments

/-! ## §3 — the executor projection: `execFullA` on `noteCreateA` IS `noteCreateChainA`.

The `noteCreateA` arm of `execFullA` (`TurnExecutorFull.lean:3539`) is `some (noteCreateChainA s cm
actor)` — a SINGLE, TOTAL branch (always `some`). We expose it as a definitional rewrite so the spec
proof works on `noteCreateChainA`. -/

    execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some (noteCreateChainA st cm actor) := rfl

/-! ## §4 — FULL-STATE SEMANTIC SPEC (the INDEPENDENT reference) + executor⟺spec.

`NoteCreateASpec` is the COMPLETE declarative post-state of a committed `noteCreateA`, written
INDEPENDENTLY of the executor: the (trivial) guard holds; the post `kernel.commitments` is `cm`
prepended; the post `log` is the disclosed receipt prepended; and ALL 16 non-`commitments` kernel
components are LITERALLY unchanged. No frame clause mentions
`execFullA`/`noteCreateChainA`/`noteCreateCommitment`. -/

/-- **The full-state declarative spec of a committed note-commitment (`noteCreateA`)** — the
INDEPENDENT reference semantics. Enumerates the FRAME completely: the (trivial) guard, the touched
`commitments` + `log`, and every one of the 16 untouched non-`commitments` kernel fields. -/

/-- **`noteCreateChainA_iff_spec` — CHAINED EXECUTOR ⟺ SPEC (FULL state, both directions).** The
chained note-create commits into `st'` IFF `st'` is EXACTLY the spec'd full post-state. The `→`
VALIDATES `noteCreateChainA` against the independent spec — all 18 components
(`commitments` + `log` + 16 frame fields) are checked, so a silently-mutated component would make the
proof FAIL; the `←` reconstructs the committed state from the spec. Because the arm is TOTAL there is
no `if`-split: the equation `noteCreateChainA st cm actor = st'` characterizes the post-state directly. -/

/-- **`execNoteCreateA_iff_spec` — THE DELIVERABLE: `execFullA`-LEVEL EXECUTOR ⟺ SPEC (FULL state,
both directions).** The one gated executor commits a `noteCreateA` turn into `st'` IFF `st'` is EXACTLY
the independent full-state spec. Forward VALIDATES the executor (every one of the 18 components is
pinned); backward reconstructs. This is the note-commitment corner of the spec⟺executor(⟺circuit)
triangle, the `noteCreateA` analog of `recKExec_iff_spec`. -/

/-! ## §5 — derived guarantees off the spec.

The spec is the apex truth; these read off it without re-touching the executor. -/

/-- **`noteCreateA_inserts` — the published commitment is in the post-set.** A committed `noteCreateA`
PROVES `cm ∈ st'.kernel.commitments`. Read off the spec's `commitments` clause + the
declaratively-validated helper. -/

/-- **`noteCreateA_preserves` — append-only: no prior commitment is lost.** A committed `noteCreateA`
PROVES every PRIOR commitment remains a member of the post-set (the grow-only / append-only property).
Read off the spec's `commitments` clause. -/

  rw [hcm]; exact List.mem_cons_of_mem _ hx

/-- **`noteCreateA_bal_neutral` — BALANCE NEUTRALITY (semantic content).** A committed `noteCreateA`
leaves the `bal` ledger LITERALLY unchanged (it grows only `commitments`, never `bal`). Read off the
spec's `bal` frame clause. This is the conservation punchline: a note-commitment publish moves NO
value. -/

  ((execNoteCreateA_iff_spec st cm actor st').mp h).2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.1

/-- **`noteCreateA_total` — THE DISTINGUISHING THEOREM: a note-create ALWAYS COMMITS.** Unlike
`noteSpendA` (fail-closed on a repeated nullifier), `noteCreateA` is UNCONDITIONAL — there is ALWAYS a
committed post-state, regardless of the pre-state. This is the "append-only, no double-check" property
the prompt calls out, proved at the executor level. -/
theorem noteCreateA_total (st : RecChainedState) (cm : Nat) (actor : CellId) :
    ∃ st', execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some st' :=
  ⟨noteCreateChainA st cm actor, rfl⟩

/-- **`noteCreateA_admits_iff` — the executor commits IFF the (trivial) guard holds.** Mirrors the
reference shape; since the guard is `True`, commitment is unconditional. -/
theorem noteCreateA_admits_iff (st : RecChainedState) (cm : Nat) (actor : CellId) :
    (∃ st', execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some st') ↔ noteCreateAdmit := by
  unfold noteCreateAdmit
  exact ⟨fun _ => trivial, fun _ => noteCreateA_total st cm actor⟩

/-! ## §6 — NON-VACUITY / DISTINCTNESS: the spec is genuine, and the effect is grow-only.

A spec that accepts everything would be worthless ONLY if the effect itself were a no-op — but
`noteCreateA` GROWS the commitment set every time (and is the SOLE effect that touches
`commitments`). We exhibit: it strictly extends the set (length grows), and the published commitment
was not necessarily present before — so the spec carries real content. (`noteCreateA` is total by
design, so there is no "rejection" theorem; the genuine content is the strict GROWTH, below.) -/

/-- **`noteCreateA_grows` — the commitment set STRICTLY grows by one.** A committed `noteCreateA`
increases `commitments.length` by exactly 1 — the effect is never a no-op on its tracked set. -/
theorem noteCreateA_grows (st : RecChainedState) (cm : Nat) (actor : CellId)
    (st' : RecChainedState) (h : execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some st') :

  have hcm := ((execNoteCreateA_iff_spec st cm actor st').mp h).2.1
  rw [hcm]; simp [List.length_cons]

/-- **`noteCreateA_log_grows` — the receipt chain advances by exactly one row** (the disclosed
`escrowReceiptA actor`). Read off the spec's `log` clause. -/
theorem noteCreateA_log_grows (st : RecChainedState) (cm : Nat) (actor : CellId)
    (st' : RecChainedState) (h : execFullA st (.noteCreateA cm actor) = some st') :
    st'.log = noteCreateReceipt actor :: st.log :=
  ((execNoteCreateA_iff_spec st cm actor st').mp h).2.2.1

/-! ## §7 — concrete #guard non-vacuity witnesses (genuine `decide`, NOT `native_decide`).

Cell 9 publishes commitment `42`. The publish ALWAYS commits (totality); the post-set CONTAINS `42`;
a SECOND publish of the SAME `42` ALSO commits (append-only — no double-check, unlike noteSpend); the
`bal` ledger is untouched. -/

/-- A concrete pre-state: one live cell, empty commitment set, empty log. -/
def stN0 : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel :=
      { accounts := {9}
        cell := fun _ => .record [("balance", .int 0)]
        caps := fun _ => [] }
    log := [] }

-- A note-create of commitment 42 by actor 9 ALWAYS COMMITS:
#guard (execFullA stN0 (.noteCreateA 42 9)).isSome  --  true
-- The post-set contains the published commitment 42:
#guard decide (42 ∈ (noteCreateChainA stN0 42 9).kernel.commitments)  --  true
-- APPEND-ONLY / NO DOUBLE-CHECK: publishing the SAME commitment 42 AGAIN ALSO commits (the
-- distinguishing property vs noteSpend, which would fail-close on a repeat):
#guard ((execFullA stN0 (.noteCreateA 42 9)).bind
          (fun s => execFullA s (.noteCreateA 42 9))).isSome  --  true
-- ...and after two publishes the set has length 2 (it grew BOTH times):
#guard decide (((execFullA stN0 (.noteCreateA 42 9)).bind
          (fun s => execFullA s (.noteCreateA 42 9))).map
          (fun s => s.kernel.commitments.length) = some 2)  --  true
-- The commitment set strictly grows by one on a single publish:
#guard decide ((noteCreateChainA stN0 42 9).kernel.commitments.length = 1)  --  true
