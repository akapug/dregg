# `Dregg2.Circuit.MapOpsColumnLayout` — the MAPOPS-AIR MODELER: from ANY descriptor's `.mapOp`
constraints onto the deployed map-reconcile gate data (the in-circuit binary-Merkle path
recompute), ∀ `d : EffectVmDescriptor2` — the memory/map twin of `LogUpColumnLayout`.

## HONEST SCOPE (first sentence)

This file MODELS, for an ARBITRARY v2 descriptor, the `Ir2Air::MapOps` AIR
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:2213`, `heap_root.rs::CanonicalHeapTree`) that
`docs/SUPERSEDED/MEMORY-LEGS-SCOPE.md` §3 names as the ONE shared real item for the 7 mapOp
effects — and PROVES the ∀ d MAPOPS-AIR LAW: the deployed map-reconcile gates (a sibling-path
recompute of the opened leaf to the committed pre-root, plus — for writes — the SAME path
recomputing the new leaf to the post-root column) FORCE `MapOp.holdsAt`, the existential
`opensTo`/`writesTo` denotation (`DescriptorIR2.lean:511`), for every `.mapOp` row of every
descriptor (`mapOp_holds_of_mapReconcile` / `mapOpsArm_of_modeler`). The crux is the
extraction-shaped Merkle-opening argument (`pathRecompute_binds_updates`): under the single named
hash floor `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, a path recomputing to the committed perfect-tree root BINDS the
opened leaf to the committed leaf vector at the path's position — a forged opening is two distinct
lists under one 2-to-1 node image, i.e. a Poseidon2 collision (the same floor and the same
induction shape as `OodCommitmentBinding.merkleRecomputeZ_binds` / `FriVerifier.merkleRecompute_binds`,
here strengthened with the UPDATE direction so the post-root of a write is forced too).

This is NOT a bus: the mapOps table's `TableDef` kind is `.mapReconcile` (`DescriptorIR2.lean:169`),
one row per boundary reconciliation, checked by path recomputation — a different argument from the
LogUp cumulative sum, hence this separate modeler (MEMORY-LEGS-SCOPE §1).

## What is GENERAL (∀ d) vs what stays PER-DESCRIPTOR / per-deployment

GENERAL, proved here for every descriptor:
  * the extraction — `mapOpsOf d` (`DescriptorIR2`), the fired row ops `firedMapOpsAt`, and
    `mapLog_eq_fired`: the gathered map-ops log IS the per-row fired-op rows, read off ANY `d`;
  * the PATH-BINDING LAW (`pathRecompute_binds_updates`): a path recomputing to the root of a
    `2^dep`-leaf digest vector opens EXACTLY the committed leaf at the path position, and the same
    siblings recompute any replacement leaf to the root of the UPDATED vector — pure CR peeling,
    level by level (`mapNode_injective` at each node);
  * the per-kind openers riding it: `opensToMerkle_of_path` (`.read`),
    `opensToMerkle_none_of_bracket` (`.absent` — TWO adjacent-position paths bracketing the key,
    the deployed gap opening; adjacency of positions ⟹ `Adjacent` on the key spine ⟹
    `Heap.get_none_of_gap`), `writesToMerkle_of_path` (`.write`/`.insert` — old-leaf path to the
    pre-root + new-leaf path to the post-root ⟹ the post-root IS `mapRoot (Heap.set …)`);
  * THE LAW (∀ d): `mapOp_holds_of_mapReconcile` (per row) and `mapOpsArm_of_modeler` (the whole
    `.mapOp` arm of `Satisfied2.rowConstraints` for any `d`), plus the graduated+mapOps `hbus`
    splitter `hbus_of_busModels_and_mapModel` (every non-arith constraint a `.lookup` OR a
    `.mapOp` — the shape all 7 memory-touching mapOp effects have) and the full assembler
    `airAccept_forces_satisfied2_of_modelers`.

PER-DESCRIPTOR / per-deployment (each NAMED, none silently assumed):
  * the KNOWLEDGE-EXTRACTION premise inside `ReconcileGatesAt`: the prover's committed canonical
    heap behind the row's pre-root column (`∃ h, SortedKeys h ∧ |h| = 2^dep ∧ mapRoot h = root`).
    This is MEMORY-LEGS-SCOPE §3's honest crux, option (i): the deployed prover's
    `CanonicalHeapTree` update witness IS the whole-tree witness; what the GATES then FORCE — the
    real content of this file — is that the row's `(key, value, new_root)` columns cannot LIE
    about that heap (a lie ⟹ a Poseidon2 collision). The row columns are never assumed truthful;
    they are derived truthful.
  * SPECIES B (`mapTableFaithful : t.tf .mapOps = mapLog d t`) — the table-ASSEMBLY fact, the
    same classification `AirLegsDischarged` gives transferV3's emptiness pair; carried NAMED in
    the assembler (`hMapTF`), never derived from AIR arithmetic. Part B of the split.
  * WHICH map each effect writes and that its selector fires — the per-effect teeth that already
    exist downstream of `Satisfied2` (`noteSpendV3_grow_gate_forces_set_insert`,
    `noteCreateV3_grow_gate_forces_set_insert`, `createCellV3/factoryV3/spawnV3/spawnWriteV3_…`,
    `refusalFieldsWriteV3_forces_write`, `heapWrite_splice_forced`) — those consume the arm this
    file produces; nothing per-effect is re-proved here.
  * the Rust-assembly correspondence: that the deployed p3 mapOps columns are laid out as modeled
    (the `mix` closure = `pathRecompute` with the leaf-to-root fold listed root-first; the gap
    opening = two adjacent-position paths). The SAME pinned Lean-model-to-Rust boundary every
    `DescriptorIR2` denotation sits on.

Note on `.insert` vs `.write`: both denote `writesTo` (sorted insert-or-update) with the deployed
`2^dep`-leaf PADDED vector (MIN/MAX sentinels are real entries of the modeled heap), so the
modeled gate for both is the update-at-an-opened-leaf shape; `.insert` freshness is established
SEPARATELY by the paired `.absent` op (exactly the noteSpend pattern, `DescriptorIR2.lean:251-256`).

## Heap safety

Everything is symbolic — `MAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16` is never unfolded into a tree, no `2^16` object is
ever constructed. The non-vacuity teeth run at a 2-LEVEL heap (`dep = 2`, 4 leaves) through the
SAME depth-generic theorems the deployed depth instantiates; `decide` only ever touches short
literal ℤ lists.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; sorry-free. Crypto enters ONLY as the
named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (the same one the whole commitment tower carries), never as an
axiom. NEW file; imports read-only.

`mapOpsOf d` (the declared `.mapOp` constraints) already lives in `DescriptorIR2`; here we pin its

that the gathered `mapLog` is exactly the fired ops' evaluated `(root, key, value, op, new_root)`
rows. This is the A-side extraction: what the mapOps table must carry, per row, for any `d`. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE PATH MODEL: the deployed `mix` closure and the CR binding law.

The deployed `Ir2Air::MapOps` AIR recomputes the opened leaf up its sibling path to the committed
root (the `mix` closure over `heap_root.rs`'s update/membership witnesses). We model a path as the
ROOT-FIRST list of `(side, sibling)` steps — `(false, s)` = the opened subtree is the LEFT child
(sibling `s` on the right), `(true, s)` = RIGHT child (sibling on the left); the deployed fold
iterates leaf-to-root, which is this list reversed (a presentation choice, same fold). `pathPos`
is the leaf index the side bits select. -/

Under the single named CR floor: a path recomputing `leaf` to the perfect-tree root of a
`2^depth`-leaf vector `xs`
  (1) BINDS the opened leaf — `xs[pathPos steps]? = some leaf` (a different claimed leaf under
      the same root is two distinct child pairs under one `mapNode` image at some level, i.e. a
      Poseidon2 collision — the same peel as `OodCommitmentBinding.merkleRecomputeZ_binds`), and
  (2) FORCES THE UPDATE — the SAME siblings recompute any replacement `leaf'` to the root of
      `xs.set (pathPos steps) leaf'` (CR pins every sibling to the true subtree root, so the
      write's post-root column is the genuine updated commitment, not a forgery).

/-! ## §8 — THE AAFI TWO-PATH INSERT COLUMN MODEL (`MapKind::AafiInsert`, code 4).

Mirrors `docs/reference/GAP5-AAFI-CUTOVER-PLAN.md` §2 (the AAFI cutover of the append-only
accumulators — nullifier / commitment / revoked sets — to the two-path insert that closes GAP #5's
double-spend). The current per-turn `.insert` opens ONE leaf over ONE shared path against
`new_root` — sound for value-updates (stable position) but NOT for insert (the compacted-array
suffix shifts, no shared pre-image binds the shifted region). AAFI replaces it with the Aztec
INDEXED-Merkle two-path insert at STABLE positions (append-at-free-index), whose leaf is the 3-felt
linked-list node `hash[addr, value, nextAddr]`.

The AAFI row carries TWO INDEPENDENT openings plus the pointer-bracket range gate (§2.2 columns):
  * PATH1 (`MAP_SIB0/DIR0`, repurposed) — the LOW leaf `hash[low.addr, low.value, low.next]` opens
    to the pre-root, and (updated `next := k`) recomputes to the intermediate root `R1` (`MAP_R1`);
  * the RANGE gate `low.addr < k < low.next` (`MAP_RANGE0`) — the pointer bracket that binds `k`
    into the low leaf's real gap (the double-spend tooth: a present / out-of-gap `k` has no
    bracket → UNSAT);
  * PATH2 (`MAP_SIB2_0/DIR2_0`, NEW) — the FREE slot opens EMPTY (`MAP_FREE_EMPTY`) to `R1`
    (no overwrite), and the appended leaf `hash[k, v, low.next]` recomputes to `new_root`.

THE LAW (`aafiInsert_forces_imtInsert`): accepting AAFI gates FORCE `new_root` to be the perfect-
tree root of the digest vector `xs` with EXACTLY two positions changed — the low position updated
to `next := k`, and the free position set to the appended leaf — i.e. the DIGEST-VECTOR FACE of
`IndexedMerkleTree.imtInsert` (step (i) update-low-`nextAddr` + step (ii) append-`(k,v,low_oldNext)`
at a free slot, no shift). Forced through the proven `pathRecompute_binds_updates` (used TWICE: the
low-update leg — `IndexedMerkleTree.imtLowUpdate_binds` is its 3-felt IMT face — and the append
leg), under the single named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor. The pointer bracket `low.addr < k < low.next`
survives to the conclusion — the `IndexedMerkleTree.ImtAbsent` witness the sorted-preservation step
consumes.

★ REMAINING WIRE (named, per `feedback-named-seam-is-not-a-hole.md`) — the `imtInsert`-SYMBOL
correspondence and `ImtSorted`-preservation live in `Dregg2.Circuit.IndexedMerkleTree`, NOT here:
that module IMPORTS this file (it opens `pathRecompute`/`pathPos`/`pathRecompute_binds_updates`
from here), so referencing `imtInsert` / `imtInsert_preserves` / `canonicalHeapExtract_of_imt` in
this file is a MODULE-IMPORT CYCLE. This law delivers the two-path forcing at the digest-vector
level (the maximal statement expressible below IMT in the DAG) PLUS the pointer bracket; the bridge
`new_root = perfectRoot (imtToHeap-digest-vector of imtInsert c k v)` ∧ `ImtSorted (imtInsert …)`
(from `imtInsert_preserves` + `reachable_sorted` ⟹ `canonicalHeapExtract_of_imt`) is the one-lemma
follow-up that belongs in `IndexedMerkleTree.lean` (which has both `imtInsert` and this law in
scope). No re-assumption: the forcing here is genuine (`pathRecompute_binds_updates`, twice). -/

low leaf, whose free position is EMPTY after the low-update, and whose two-point update (low
`next := k`; append `(k, v, low.next)` at the distinct free slot) has root EXACTLY `new_root`. Forced
by `pathRecompute_binds_updates` used TWICE (PATH1 low → R1, PATH2 free → new_root through R1). The
pointer bracket `low.addr < k < low.next` survives — the `ImtAbsent` witness sorted-preservation
consumes. No re-assumption: the two-point forcing is the proven Merkle-opening extraction. -/

/-! ## §8b — THE AAFI COLUMN-WIDTH MIRROR (the DEPLOYED `descriptor_ir2.rs` op=4 block).

The Lean twin of A1's `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs` `MapKind::AafiInsert` (code 4) columns. The
offsets below are pinned to the DEPLOYED `const MAP_*` values — i.e. the values the compiler
EVALUATES the const expressions to (`descriptor_ir2.rs:1845-1869`), the columns the AIR actually
reads — NOT the hand-written `//` comments beside them.

⚠ GROUND-TRUTH NOTE (do not "fix" these to the Rust `//` comments): with `CHIP_OUT_LANES = 8`,
`HEAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`, `MA_DECOMP_COLS = MA_CMP_COLS = 13`, the const chain evaluates to
`MAP_S=421, MAP_R1=422, MAP_LOW_ADDR=430, MAP_LOW_VALUE=431, MAP_LOW_NEW=432, MAP_LOW_NEW_CHAIN0=440,
MAP_SIB2_0=560, MAP_DIR2_0=688, MAP_FREE_EMPTY=704, MAP_FREE_EMPTY_CHAIN0=712, MAP_A_DEC0=832,
MAP_WIDTH=897`. The `//` comments in descriptor_ir2.rs beside the AAFI block (429, 559, 831, …) are
STALE — off by −1 below `MAP_S`, left over from the pre-`MAP_S` plan layout where `MAP_R1 = 421`.
The compiler ignores comments; the deployed circuit uses the arithmetic, so THIS mirror uses the
arithmetic. (A1 added the degree-1 `MAP_S` selector at `MAP_AAFI_BASE = 421`, forced by the frozen
map-ops degree-4 budget — a `op(op-1)(op-3)` polynomial selector is degree 3. It is pinned to op=4
by three low-degree constraints `s(s-1)=0`, `s·(op-4)=0`, `op(op-1)(op-3)·(1-s)=0`.)

The AAFI region is `[MAP_AAFI_BASE, MAP_WIDTH) = [421, 897) = 476` columns: the 1-felt `MAP_S`
selector at 421 plus the 475-column two-path payload. The `#guard`s pin every offset to the deployed
per-group widths (1,8,1,1,8,120,128,16,8,120,65) so this model AGREES with A1's ACTUAL layout

EQUAL, but they differ at the low position (`(0,0,100)` vs `(0,0,50)`, distinct by
`aafiLeafHash_injective` since `100 ≠ 50`). The append genuinely MOVES the committed root — the
