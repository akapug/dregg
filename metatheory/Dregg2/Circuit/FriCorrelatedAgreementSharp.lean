# `WrapCorrelatedAgreementSharp` — the δ-PRESERVING (Johnson-radius) residual, REDUCED to the
BCIKS20 affine-line correlated-agreement primitive, and the primitive NAMED as a Lean `Prop`.

`FriProximityGapWitness.lean` pushed the Fisher/packing method to its exact ceiling:
`wrap_badChallengePoly_johnson` proves `BadChallengePoly friSetupWrapRate 112 42 26` — `L = 26` at
the Johnson OUTER radius `dOut = 112` but with `dIn = 42` (relative `21/32`), NOT the folded code's
own Johnson radius `dIn = 56` (relative `7/8`). The obstruction is arithmetic and sharp: the packing
quadratic `a² > n·M` (`a = 64 − dIn`, `n = 64`, `M = 7`) FAILS for `dIn ≥ 43` (`a ≤ 21`,
`a² ≤ 441 < 448`). So the packing radius is *dead* at `dIn = 56` (`a = 8`, `a² = 64 ≪ 448`):
farness degrades across the fold (`7/8 → 21/32`) rather than being δ-preserved (`7/8 → 7/8`).

That named residual is `WrapCorrelatedAgreementSharp L := BadChallengePoly friSetupWrapRate 112 56 L`
(`FriProximityGapWitness.lean §F`). This file does not fake it. It does two honest things.

## §1. The exact remaining primitive, NAMED (`CorrelatedAgreementLine`).

BCIKS20's *correlated agreement for an affine line* over a code `C'`: viewing the FRI fold
`Fold α f = E f + α·O f` as the affine line `{u + α·v}` (`u = E f`, `v = O f`) of functions on the
folded domain, if MORE than `L` challenges `α` fold `f` to within `dIn` of `C'`, then there is a
SINGLE common agreement — codewords `ge, go ∈ C'` and a set of fibers `S` with
`|S| ≥ |κ| − dIn` on which `E f = ge` and `O f = go` SIMULTANEOUSLY. The threshold `|κ| − dIn` is the
**δ-preserving** (relative `1 − δ`) agreement — the sharp BCIKS20 statement, beyond the packing reach.
`CorrelatedAgreementLineAt S dIn L agree` carries the agreement threshold as a parameter so the
δ-preserving version (`agree = |κ| − dIn`) and the two-point version (`agree = |κ| − 2·dIn`) share one
shape.

This primitive is NOT assumed anywhere in the deployed chain (which consumes
`wrap_friProximityGap_johnson`, a theorem). It is stated so the residual is a Lean `Prop`, not prose.

## §2. The REDUCTION (`sharp_of_correlatedAgreementLine`) — a THEOREM, no `sorry`.

`CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 56 L → WrapCorrelatedAgreementSharp L`. The mechanism is
the deployed dimension-`2` collapse already proved in `FriProximityGapWitness.lean`: on the wrap
setup `C'` is the CONSTANTS, so the correlated-agreement codewords are `ge = const a`, `go = const b`,
and their common agreement set is EXACTLY `Φ⁻¹(a, b) = {y | E f y = a ∧ O f y = b}`. δ-preservation
forces `|Φ⁻¹(a,b)| ≥ 64 − 56 = 8`, but `far_fiber_card` / `wrap_fiber_le_seven` cap it at
`(128 − 112 − 1)/2 = 7` for a `112`-far word. `8 ≤ 7` is absurd, so the good set has `≤ L` elements —
and the BCIKS20 witness polynomial `∏_{α good}(X − C α)` (nonzero, degree `≤ L`) is exhibited exactly
as in `wrap_badChallengePoly_johnson`. This is where the sharp `7/8 → 7/8` δ-preservation lives: the
one place `far_fiber_card`'s `M = 7` *beats* the `δ = 7/8` agreement floor of `8`.

## §3. Non-vacuity / genuine-strengthening certificate (`correlatedAgreementLineAt_twoPoint`).

The primitive is not a black box: at `L = 1` its WEAK form (`agree = |κ| − 2·dIn`) is a THEOREM,
proved by the BBHR18 two-point reconstruction (the same Vandermonde solve behind
`fold_close_of_two_alpha`): two good challenges pin `E f = Ge`, `O f = Go` off the union of the two
disagreement sets, giving common agreement on `≥ |κ| − 2·dIn` fibers with `Ge, Go ∈ C'`. So the
`∃ ge go, agree ≤ …` SHAPE is inhabited and provable; the SOLE gap to the sharp statement is the
strengthening of the agreement floor from `|κ| − 2·dIn` (two-point) to `|κ| − dIn` (δ-preserving) —
which is precisely BCIKS20's correlated-agreement content, and precisely what is left open, named,
and NOT `sorry`'d.

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `axiom`, no `sorry`.

/-! ## §3b. THE δ-PRESERVING PRIMITIVE, PROVED at LINEAR list size (BCIKS20 correlated-agreement core).

`correlatedAgreementLineAt_twoPoint` gave the primitive only at the *weak* floor `|κ| − 2·dIn`
(vacuous at `dIn = 56`). Here the SHARP floor `|κ| − dIn` is PROVED for the deployed wrap setup —
the exact BCIKS20 correlated-agreement content — by the deployed dimension-`2` collapse, WITHOUT the
general Guruswami–Sudan interpolation machinery, at a LINEAR list size `L = 512 = |κ|²/(|κ| − dIn)`
— the tight BCIKS `n/(1−δ)` scaling, not the quadratic `|κ|²`. The RADIUS is sharp too:
`dIn = 56 = (7/8)·64`, δ-preserving.

**Why single-fibre pinning (Route 1) is IMPOSSIBLE, and how a DUAL count still gives linear.**
Fix `f`. Suppose NO constant point `(a,b) ∈ F²` is rich — every fibre `Φ⁻¹(a,b)` has `< 8` fibres.
Each good `α` folds `f` to a constant `c_α` on `≥ 8` fibres `S_α = {y | E f y + α·O f y = c_α}`, and
`C'` = CONSTANTS forces any `y, y' ∈ S_α` with `Φ y ≠ Φ y'` to obey `O f y ≠ O f y'` and to PIN
`α = (E f y' − E f y)/(O f y − O f y')`. The pin needs BOTH fibres — the free constant `c_α` cancels
only in the DIFFERENCE — so no single distinguished fibre determines `α`, and the naive injection
`α ↦ (y_α, y'_α)` lands in `κ × κ`, giving only the quadratic `|Good| ≤ |κ|² = 4096`.

The linear bound comes from the DUAL of that pin. For `α ≠ β`, a pair `(y, y')` with `Φ y ≠ Φ y'`
lying in BOTH `S_α` and `S_β` folds equal under both, so it pins `α = β` — a contradiction. Hence the
ordered distinct-`Φ` pair sets `Pairs α = {(y,y') ∈ S_α × S_α | Φ y ≠ Φ y'}` are PAIRWISE DISJOINT.
Each is large: every one of `8` fibres `y ∈ S_α` has a partner of a different `Φ`-value (its own
`Φ`-fibre inside `S_α` has `≤ 7 < |S_α|` members), so `y ↦ (y, partner y)` embeds `8` fibres into
`Pairs α`, giving `|Pairs α| ≥ 8`. Disjoint `≥ 8`-subsets of `κ × κ` (card `4096`) number at most
`4096/8 = 512`. That `|κ|²/(|κ| − dIn)` is genuinely linear in `|κ|`: with `dIn = (7/8)|κ|` it is
`8·|κ|`, the BCIKS `n/(1−δ)` list size. (Each `α` consuming only `8 = |κ| − dIn` pairs, rather than
its full `≈ |S_α|²`, is why the constant is `8·|κ|` and not the ideal `|κ|`; the packing/Fisher method
that would sharpen it is DEAD here — `a² = 8² = 64 < |κ|·M = 448`, the very obstruction of §F.) -/

/-- **THE δ-PRESERVING CORRELATED-AGREEMENT PRIMITIVE, PROVED at the deployed wrap setup, LINEAR list
size.** `CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 56 292`: for ANY `f`, if more than `292` folding
challenges fold `f` to within `56 = (7/8)·64` of the constants, a SINGLE constant pair `(a,b)` agrees
with `(E f, O f)` on `≥ |κ| − 56 = 8` fibers simultaneously — the sharp `1 − δ` (δ-preserving) floor,
beyond the `|κ| − 2·dIn` two-point reach and beyond the packing method's `21/32` radius. No `sorry`,
no hypothesis.

The list size `292 = ⌈4096/14⌉` is LINEAR in `|κ|`, SHARPENED from the earlier `512 = 4096/8` by the
SHARP per-`α` pair count `|Pairs α| ≥ 14` (§3b): every good `α`'s agreement set has a `Φ`-fibre `A`
with `1 ≤ |A| ≤ 7` (no-rich-point) whose cross pairs with `S α \ A` number `2·|A|·(|S α|−|A|) ≥ 14`,
the exact minimum (attained by the `7+1` split). `14 = min(|S α|² − Σ mᵢ²)` is the true ceiling of
the ordered-pair method, so `292` is the sharpest bound THIS method reaches; the ideal `≤ |κ| = 64` is
UNREACHABLE (see §5 — the agreement floor `8 = √ρ·|κ|` sits EXACTLY at the Johnson radius, where every
GS/Johnson list-size bound has a vanishing denominator, and the true list is genuinely `> |κ|`). -/

/-! ## §5. WHY `≤ |κ| = 64` IS UNREACHABLE — the exact-Johnson-radius wall, and the named GS target.

The task's optimistic hope was that the CONSTANT-code collapse (`C'` = constants, so the
correlated-agreement codewords are `const a`) would let Guruswami–Sudan interpolation drive the list
size all the way to `≤ |κ| = 64` — the ideal `n/(1−δ)` constant `= 1`. It does NOT, and this is not a
looseness of *our* proof but of the primitive at this radius. Two independent honest facts.

**(a) `≤ |κ|` is literally FALSE at the deployed radius (a construction, not a gap).** Reduce as in
§3b: `Φ = (E f, O f) : κ → F²` gives `|κ| = 64` points (multiplicity `≤ 7` under no-rich-point), and
a good challenge `α` is a LINE `E = −α·O + c` in `F²` covering `≥ 8` points-with-multiplicity (its
slope `−α` distinct per `α`). Take two "heavy" points `p₁, p₂` of multiplicity `7` (`14` total) and
`50` further points of multiplicity `1`. Each line through `p₁` and one singleton covers `7 + 1 = 8`
(good), with a distinct slope per singleton — `50` good `α`; likewise `50` through `p₂`; generic
placement keeps these slopes distinct, so `≈ 100 > 64` good challenges with NO point of multiplicity
`≥ 8`. (A `k`-pencil optimum reaches `≈ 155`.) All of `E f, O f, α` are free (`f : ι → F` arbitrary,
`α ∈ BabyBear`), so the configuration is realizable: **no theorem of the form
`CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 56 L` with `L < ~100` can hold**, and `≤ 64` is refuted. So
the residual `8×` factor is INHERENT to the radius, exactly as the dead packing quadratic of §F warned
(`a² = 8² = 64 < |κ|·M = 448`).

**(b) The reason: agreement `8` is BELOW the GS/Johnson radius of the line code.** Viewing the good
slopes as the degree-`≤ 1` codewords (`k = 2`, block length `n = |κ| = 64`) they agree with, GS
weighted interpolation produces a nonzero bivariate `Q(x, y)` with a controllable positive `y`-degree
(hence a LINEAR list bound with the ideal constant) only when the agreement `t` STRICTLY exceeds the GS
radius `√(k·n) = √128 ≈ 11.31`, i.e. `t² > k·n`. The deployed agreement is `t = |κ| − dIn = 8`, and
`t² = 64 < 128 = k·n` — the interpolation degenerates (`Q` is forced to `0`), and no GS bound, least of
all `≤ |κ|`, exists at this radius. Equivalently, in rate terms the constant code has `√ρ = √(1/64) =
1/8` and the agreement is `8/64 = 1/8 = √ρ` EXACTLY — the Johnson boundary, where every list-size
denominator vanishes. This is certified below. -/

/-- **The deployed agreement floor sits below the GS line-decoding radius.** `t = |κ| − 56 = 8`, and
`t² = 64 < 128 = 2·|κ| = k·n` (line code `k = 2`, `n = |κ|`): the Guruswami–Sudan interpolation
hypothesis `t² > k·n` is NOT met, so GS delivers no bound at this radius — the formal reason `≤ |κ|` is
out of reach and the honest `292` (the sharp reach of the ordered-pair method) stands. -/

`2·|κ|` via the weighted-interpolation polynomial `Q(x, y)` and the `(y − f(x)) ∣ Q` divisibility. It
is stated as a conditional `Prop` so the residual is a Lean object, not prose; it is NOT proved here
(it is the real upstream lemma, on the order of Berry–Esseen), and — crucially — its hypothesis is
FALSE at the deployed radius (`wrap_below_gs_line_radius`), so even a proof of it would say nothing
about the deployed case: the `8×` gap is genuinely at/below the Johnson boundary. -/

/-! ## §6. THE INTERIOR RADIUS `dIn = 52` — off the Johnson boundary, GS NON-DEGENERATE.

`§3b`/`§5` run the deployed analysis AT the Johnson boundary `dIn = 56` (relative `7/8`), where the
line code's GS interpolation DEGENERATES: agreement `t = |κ| − 56 = 8`, and `t² = 64 < 128 = 2·|κ|`
(`wrap_below_gs_line_radius`) — the boundary `t = √ρ·|κ|` where every GS/Johnson denominator vanishes,
forcing the boundary-bespoke ordered-pair list `292`.

This section pulls the analysis radius INTERIOR to `dIn = 52` (relative `13/16`). That is a
proof-cleanliness choice, NOT a security one: the deployed `19`-query soundness has `~116` bits of
headroom (`|F| ≈ 2¹²⁴`, list term `L/2¹²⁴`), so `L = 186` at `dIn = 52` and `L = 292` at `dIn = 56`
are security-indistinguishable. What the interior BUYS is regime: at `dIn = 52` the agreement is
`t = |κ| − 52 = 12` and `t² = 144 > 128 = 2·|κ|`, so the Guruswami–Sudan NON-DEGENERACY hypothesis of
`GuruswamiSudanLineListBound` (`§5`) is MET (`wrap_meets_gs_line_radius`) — the deployed proximity
soundness now runs in the interior list-decoding regime with margin, not on the degenerate boundary.

Two honest facts about the list size at `dIn = 52`:
* **The ORDERED-PAIR method gives `L ≤ 186`, PROVED here** (`wrap_correlatedAgreementLine_interior`).
  Each good `α` now folds `f` to a constant on `≥ 12` fibers (vs `8` at `dIn = 56`), so under
  no-rich-point (every constant point has `< 12`, i.e. `≤ 11` fibers) its ordered distinct-`Φ` pair
  set `Pairs α` has card `≥ 2·11·1 = 22` (the `11+1` split minimum, vs `14` at `dIn = 56`). Each good
  `α` "consumes more pairs", so the disjoint pair sets inside `κ × κ` (card `4096`) force
  `|Good| ≤ ⌊4096/22⌋ = 186` — sharper than the boundary's `292`, and genuinely interior.
* **The GS-IDEAL `L ≤ 2·|κ| = 128` is NOT reached by the ordered-pair method** (`186 > 128`), and is
  NOT claimed here. `128 = 2·|κ|` is exactly the conclusion of `GuruswamiSudanLineListBound` — the
  weighted-interpolation lemma that handles the point MULTIPLICITIES the ordered-pair method cannot
  (a good line may carry `≥ 12` fibers on only `2` distinct `Φ`-points, mult `11 + 1`, so naive
  Johnson double-counting has a negative denominator `t² − m·n = 144 − 11·64 < 0`). Its hypothesis is
  now SATISFIABLE at `dIn = 52` (that is the value of moving interior — at `dIn = 56` the hypothesis
  is FALSE, `wrap_below_gs_line_radius`), but the lemma itself remains the named upstream target and is
  NOT discharged here. The honest interior list is `186`; the ideal `128` awaits GS. -/

/-- **The GS line-decoding NON-DEGENERACY hypothesis is MET at the interior radius `dIn = 52`.**
`t = |κ| − 52 = 12`, and `t² = 144 > 128 = 2·|κ| = k·n` (line code `k = 2`, `n = |κ|`): the
Guruswami–Sudan interpolation hypothesis `t² > k·n` HOLDS — precisely the hypothesis of
`GuruswamiSudanLineListBound friSetupWrapRate 52`, and precisely what `wrap_below_gs_line_radius`
shows FAILS at the Johnson boundary `dIn = 56`. So the interior analysis runs OFF the degenerate
boundary, in the regime where GS delivers a bound. -/

/-- **THE δ-PRESERVING CORRELATED-AGREEMENT PRIMITIVE at the INTERIOR radius `dIn = 52`, PROVED.**
`CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 52 186`: for ANY `f`, if more than `186` folding challenges
fold `f` to within `52 = (13/16)·64` of the constants, a SINGLE constant pair `(a,b)` agrees with
`(E f, O f)` on `≥ |κ| − 52 = 12` fibers simultaneously — the sharp `1 − δ` (δ-preserving) floor at
the interior radius. No `sorry`, no hypothesis.

The list `186 = ⌊4096/22⌋` is LINEAR in `|κ|` and SHARPER than the boundary `dIn = 56` list `292`,
because the interior agreement floor `12` (vs `8`) forces the per-`α` ordered distinct-`Φ` pair count
up to `22` (vs `14`): under no-rich-point every constant point has `≤ 11` fibers, so a good `α`'s
agreement set (card `≥ 12`) splits into a `Φ`-fibre `A` (`1 ≤ |A| ≤ 11`) and its complement `B`
(`|B| ≥ 1`) with `2·|A|·|B| ≥ 22` (the `11+1` minimum). The GS-ideal `≤ 2·|κ| = 128` is NOT reached
by this ordered-pair method (see `wrap_meets_gs_line_radius`: the GS hypothesis is now MET, so the
ideal is no longer refuted — but discharging it is the upstream GS interpolation lemma, not proved). -/

/-! ## §7. THE IDEAL `128 = 2·|κ|` AND THE GURUSWAMI–SUDAN ROUTE — what closes, and the precise wall.

`GuruswamiSudanLineListBound friSetupWrapRate 52` unfolds (with `wrap_meets_gs_line_radius` supplying
its now-TRUE hypothesis `144 > 128`) to `CorrelatedAgreementLine friSetupWrapRate 52 128` — the ideal
LINEAR list `2·|κ|`. That is a genuine STRENGTHENING of the proved `wrap_correlatedAgreementLine_interior`
(`… 52 186`), NOT a weakening: `CorrelatedAgreementLineAt` is ANTI-monotone in `L` (a larger `L` is a
WEAKER hypothesis `L < Good.card`), so `186` does not yield `128`. The ideal has to be EARNED by the
Guruswami–Sudan weighted-interpolation method, whose two halves are stated generally in
`Dregg2/ForMathlib/GuruswamiSudan.lean`:
* the **list-size half** (`card_le_yDegree_of_dvd` : `#messages ≤ deg_Y Q`) is PROVED there, general
  over any field — the real upstreamable GS core Mathlib lacks (it is `card_roots'` over `F[X]`);
* the **interpolation half** (`GSWitness` : existence of the vanishing bivariate `Q`) is the NAMED
  upstream target (multiplicity/Hasse-derivative vanishing + a dimension count).

The honest finding at the deployed radius: **the interpolation half is OBSTRUCTED at the very point
multiplicities the constant-code fold produces**, so GS does NOT deliver `128` here. Reducing as in
`§3b`, `Φ = (E f, O f) : κ → F²` is a MULTISET of `|κ| = 64` plane points; a good challenge `α` is a
non-vertical line covering `≥ |κ| − 52 = 12` fibres, and under no-rich-point every plane point carries
`≤ 11` fibres. Such a line can be supported on as few as `2` distinct points (the `11 + 1` split). At
that multiplicity the GS interpolation window is EMPTY — no degree `D` meets both existence and
divisibility — so the polynomial method certifies NO bound, least of all `128`. This is the `dIn = 52`
face of the recurring `FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp` theme: the fold's point multiplicities break the
distinct-point GS analysis that `t² > 2·|κ|` (`wrap_meets_gs_line_radius`) would otherwise unlock.

`128` is therefore NEITHER discharged here (no GS route reaches it) NOR refuted (the honest proved
upper bound is `186`; the ordered-pair pencil constructions of `§5` reach only `~100` at this radius,
so the true list sits in `[~100, 186]` and `128` is genuinely open). The deployed composition stays
`wrap_friProximityGap_interior_proved` (`186`); `128` remains the named GS target. Two proved
certificates pin the wall. -/

/-- **The Koetter–Vardy (weighted-GS) denominator is NEGATIVE at the deployed max multiplicity.**
`t = |κ| − 52 = 12`, `t² = 144`, and the heaviest admissible plane point carries `m = 11` fibres
(no-rich-point), so `t² − m·|κ| = 144 − 11·64 = 144 − 704 < 0`. Weighting the interpolation by fibre
multiplicity (the only way to credit a heavy point its `≥ t` agreement) drives the existence degree
above the divisibility degree — no valid weighted-GS window. This is `§5`/`§6`'s named negative
denominator (`t² − m·n < 0`), made a theorem: the reason `t² > 2·|κ|` alone does not deliver `128`. -/

/-- **The UNWEIGHTED GS interpolation window is EMPTY at a support-`2` good line.** A good `α` may fold
`f` to a constant on `≥ 12` fibres carried by only `2` distinct `Φ`-points (the `11 + 1` split), so its
line is supported on `s = 2` points. GS then needs divisibility `s·m > D` (i.e. `D < 2m`), while a
nonzero multiplicity-`m` interpolant over the `≤ |κ| = 64` distinct plane points needs
`(D+1)(D+2) > 64·m(m+1)` (coefficients over vanishing constraints) — incompatible for EVERY `m ≥ 1, D`,
via the general `ForMathlib.GuruswamiSudan.gs_interp_window_empty` at `n = |κ| = 64`. So the polynomial
method certifies no list bound at the deployed multiplicity regime; in particular it does not reach
