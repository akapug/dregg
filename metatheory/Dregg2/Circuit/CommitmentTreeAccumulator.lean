# Dregg2.Circuit.CommitmentTreeAccumulator — the DEPLOYED append-only 4-ary Poseidon2
  note-commitment accumulator, AUTHORED IN LEAN (architectural law #1).

## What object this is (and why the existing Lean note model is NOT it)

`commit/src/poseidon2_tree.rs` (`Poseidon2MerkleTree::{append, root, from_leaves}`) is the
position-indexed, append-only, fan-out-4 Poseidon2 Merkle tree the note-commitment set lives in.
Its root is a genuine 4-ary tree over `hash_4_to_1`, with EMPTY_LEAF-padded slots and an
empty-subtree shortcut. That Rust is DEBT (law #1: AIR/accumulator logic is authored in Lean; Rust
only calls into the Lean-emitted object). This module is the faithful Lean author of that object.

The prior Lean "note model" (`RotatedKernelRefinementNotes.noteListRoot`) is a `listDigest` over a
`List Nat` — a ONE-SHOT sponge of the whole list, NOT a position-indexed 4-ary tree. It binds the
kernel `commitments : List Nat` datum (the right thing at the KERNEL layer), but it is a DIFFERENT
object than the deployed accumulator: no positions, no fan-out-4 internal nodes, no EMPTY_LEAF
padding, no incremental append. This module models the DEPLOYED tree exactly.

## The hash floor is CARRIED and REDUCED, never assumed as an axiom

The node compression is the opaque `H : List ℤ → ℤ` (the `gStep`/`listDigest` convention — a 4-element
list into one felt), the Lean stand-in for `hash_4_to_1`. Binding is REDUCED to `H`-collision-resistance
two ways:

  * `root_binds_of_injective` — the `ListCommit`-style reduction to the `compressNInjective H` carrier
    (⚠ that carrier is the ⊤/realizable form, documented FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters in
    `StateCommit`/`Spike.CommitTreeRegrounded`; kept for the clean reduction, priced there);
  * `root_distinct_extracts_collision` — the HONEST form that assumes NO floor: two leaf sequences that
    DIFFER inside the tree's capacity yet share a root EXHIBIT a genuine `H`-collision (`∃ l ≠ l', H l =
    H l'`). This is the counting-core-consumable reduction (`CommitTreeRegrounded.exists_collision_*`
    shape) — it is honest even where injectivity is false, because it produces a collision rather than
    presupposing none.

## Properties proved

  * `emptyHash_correct` — the DEPLOYED empty-subtree shortcut is SOUND: a node whose whole subtree is
    beyond the populated leaves equals the precomputed `emptyHash` for its level (this is the equality
    between `poseidon2_tree.rs`'s optimized `compute_node_at_level` and this pure recursion).
  * `root_binds_of_injective` / `root_distinct_extracts_collision` — root binds the padded leaf
    sequence (reduced to the `H` floor, per above).
  * `nodeAt_congr` + `append_offpath_unchanged` — the INCREMENTAL-APPEND lemma: appending at position
    `p = leaves.length` changes the root only along the single root-to-leaf path whose windows contain
    `p`; every off-path node is unchanged.
  * `append_length` — append is GENUINELY ADDITIVE (length grows by one, never idempotent). Exactly-once
    is NOT claimed here: dedup/no-double-insert is the finalization/nullifier layer's job
    (`Exec.NullifierAccumulator`), tracked separately.

/-- **`EMPTY_LEAF`** — the domain-separated empty-slot sentinel, `= 0x0DEAD1EF` exactly as
`poseidon2_tree.rs::EMPTY_LEAF = BabyBear(0x0DEAD1EF)`. A fixed non-zero constant so an empty slot is
distinguishable from a legitimate zero-valued leaf. -/
def EMPTY_LEAF : ℤ := 233492975  -- 0x0DEAD1EF

Rust `get_leaf` (`if i < len then leaves[i] else EMPTY_LEAF`). -/
def leafAt (leaves : List ℤ) (i : Nat) : ℤ := (leaves[i]?).getD EMPTY_LEAF

/-- **`emptyHash H level`** — the precomputed hash of an all-empty subtree of height `level` (Rust
`EMPTY_HASHES`): level 0 is `EMPTY_LEAF`, level `k+1` hashes four copies of level `k`. -/

  | level+1 => H [emptyHash H level, emptyHash H level, emptyHash H level, emptyHash H level]

/-- **`nodeAt H leaves level index`** — the value of the node at (`level`, `index`), the PURE 4-ary
recursion (no empty-subtree shortcut): a level-0 node is the padded leaf; a level-`k+1` node is `H` of
its four children at level `k` (indices `4·index .. 4·index+3`). This is Rust
`compute_node_at_level` WITHOUT the `first_leaf >= len` optimization; `emptyHash_correct` proves the
optimization equals this. -/

def root (H : List ℤ → ℤ) (depth : Nat) (leaves : List ℤ) : ℤ := nodeAt H leaves depth 0

additive; the Lean image of Rust `append` (`position = len; leaves.push(leaf)`). -/

/-! ### A tiny toy (fits `u64`) for a NUMERIC Rust↔Lean structural cross-check.

Depth 1, `M = 7`, `EMPTY = 3`, so the golden fits a machine word — mirrored byte-for-byte in the Rust
differential test, giving an actual cross-language equality on the tree SHAPE (independent of Poseidon2,
which is opaque here). -/
