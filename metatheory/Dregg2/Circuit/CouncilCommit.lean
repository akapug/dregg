# Dregg2.Circuit.CouncilCommit — LIGHT-CLIENT-UNFOOLABLE social recovery: the guardian council
commitment is ABSORBED into the circuit state commitment, so a verifier-only light client can
confirm a key-rotation was genuinely K-of-N guardian-blessed WITHOUT trusting the host's off-circuit
`StaticThresholdSigPolicy`.

## The threat the host-policy alone leaves open

`sdk/tests/identity_social_recovery_e2e.rs` authorizes the identity cell's `set_state` via
`Authorization::Custom -> ThresholdSigVerifier -> dregg_federation hints::verify_aggregate` (a HINTS
weighted-threshold-BLS guardian quorum) + the `KeyRotationGate` KERI pre-rotation `StateConstraint`.
That gate runs in the HOST executor. A light client that only checks the published state-commitment
root, and *trusts the host* to have run the threshold check, is fooled by a dishonest host that
rotated to an attacker key under a sub-threshold quorum: the root would still be "valid", because the
WHO of the authorization was never bound into the commitment.

`Dregg2.Apps.PreRotation` already proves the HOW is unforgeable (`rotate_compromise_resistant`,
`rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`): the rotate verb admits ONLY exhibiting the preimage of the
committed `next_keys_digest`, current keys are powerless (`rfl`), and the forward chain is pinned by
the commitment stream under `KeySetCR`. But "the HOW is unforgeable in the executor" is a statement
ABOUT THE HOST. The light client needs the WHO recoverable from the ROOT alone.

## The binding (this module)

The council's authority surfaces as committed CELL STATE: the identity cell holds a
`council_commit` register (the KERI/HINTS shape: a digest of the guardian roster — who the K-of-N
quorum is — alongside `next_keys_digest`, the next-key commitment). Because
`StateCommit.recStateCommit` binds the WHOLE `cell` map through the leaf hash `CH c (k.cell c)`
(a GENUINE binding commitment, proved in `StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds_kernel`), the
`council_commit` field is ALREADY absorbed into the published root. This module makes that
recoverability a THEOREM, not an observation:

  * `councilCommitOf` — read the identity cell's `council_commit` register off committed state.
  * `recStateCommit_recovers_council` (THE BINDING LEMMA) — two states with EQUAL `recStateCommit`
    roots (same turn) have the SAME `council_commit`. Derived directly from
    `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`: equal roots ⇒ equal KERNEL ⇒ equal identity-cell `Value` ⇒ equal
    `council_commit` field. So a verified root RECOVERS which council authorized — no host trust.
  * `recStateCommit_recovers_council_roster` (THE LIGHT-CLIENT PAYOFF) — composing with a named
    roster-CR carrier (`RosterCR`, the HINTS guardian-set digest's collision-resistance, the same
    shape as `PreRotation.KeySetCR`), a verified root recovers the actual guardian ROSTER, not just
    its digest. So a light client reading only the verifier output learns the literal K-of-N set that
    blessed the rotation.
  * `recStateCommit_distinguishes_council` (THE TOOTH, refusal polarity) — two states whose
    `council_commit` registers DIFFER have DISTINCT roots: a host that swaps the guardian set (e.g.
    to a sub-threshold or attacker-controlled quorum) cannot keep the published root. The
    substitution is FORBIDDEN BY CONSTRUCTION, visible to the verifier.

## Why this is the deepest piece — and the named VK-affecting tail

The binding lemma here is FOUNDATIONAL and lands GREEN + axiom-clean: it is a pure corollary of the
already-proved whole-kernel binding, under the SAME standard Poseidon CR set. What it does NOT do —
and what is NAMED for ember, NOT laundered — is the VK-AFFECTING deployment:

  * The `council_commit` register must be a real cell field the HOST executor writes on a
    guardian-blessed `set_state` (the `next_keys_digest` shape, `PreRotation.nextKeysDigestField`),
    and the recovery turn's descriptor must BIND the threshold check into the leaf the circuit
    commits (so the host cannot omit it). That is a circuit-descriptor change ⇒ a new VK ⇒ a redeploy.
    NAMED here (`CouncilCommitDeployTail`), NOT performed: do not regen the live VK / do not deploy.

The Lean foundation proves the binding is SOUND once that field exists and is committed; the
deployment wires the field + regenerates the VK under ember's gate.

l4v bar: `#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; crypto enters ONLY as the named
`RosterCR` hypothesis + the StateCommit CR set carried by `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`.
Non-vacuity both polarities: the binding RECOVERS (positive) and the
tooth DISTINGUISHES (refusal); concrete `#guard`s exhibit a guardian-swap root divergence.

/-! ## §0 — the `council_commit` register (the WHO of the authorization, in committed cell state).

The HINTS guardian quorum's identity is a committed digest — the `next_keys_digest` shape, beside it
on the same identity cell. `next_keys_digest` commits to the next KEY set (the HOW of a rotation);
`council_commit` commits to the guardian ROSTER (the WHO that may bless a recovery). Both are
non-`balance` metadata fields, so the `write`-verb regime invariants apply verbatim and — crucially —
both are absorbed into `StateCommit.recStateCommit` through the WHOLE-`Value` leaf hash `CH`. -/

/-- **The `council_commit` register** — the ONE named field of the identity cell carrying the digest
of the guardian roster (the HINTS K-of-N quorum that may authorize a recovery rotation). The

field. -/

/-- **`councilCommitOf idCell k`** — read the identity cell's `council_commit` register off committed

/-! ## §1 — THE BINDING LEMMA: a verified root recovers the council commitment.

The keystone. `StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds_kernel` already proves that equal full-state roots
(same turn) force the WHOLE `RecordKernelState` equal — under the standard Poseidon CR set
(`compressInjective cmb/compress`, `compressNInjective`, `cellLeafInjective`, `RestHashIffFrame`) +
the PROVED-preserved `AccountsWF`. The council commitment is a FIELD of one cell of that kernel, so it
is recovered as an immediate corollary: a light client that verifies the root learns which council
authorized, WITHOUT trusting the host's off-circuit threshold check. -/

/-! ## §1b — THE LIGHT-CLIENT PAYOFF: recover the actual guardian ROSTER, not just its digest.

The binding lemma recovers the council DIGEST. Composing with a named roster collision-resistance
carrier (`RosterCR`, the HINTS guardian-set digest's CR — the SAME shape as `PreRotation.KeySetCR`,
discharged at the deployed Poseidon2/BLAKE3 floor), a verified root recovers the actual guardian
ROSTER. A light client thereby learns the LITERAL K-of-N guardian set that blessed the recovery — the
full WHO, from the verifier output alone. -/

variable {Guardian : Type}

/-- **`RosterCR rosterHash`** — the named CR carrier for the guardian-roster digest: equal council
commitments force equal guardian rosters. The `PreRotation.KeySetCR` shape; at the deployed hash it
discharges to the Poseidon2/BLAKE3 floor (`Crypto/PortalFloor.lean`), an explicit hypothesis — never
`True`. (Constructively also covers preimage-finding: an adversary presenting any roster other than
the committed one would exhibit a collision.)

⚠ **BROKEN AS NAMED — FALSE at deployed parameters, so `recStateCommit_recovers_council_roster` below
is VACUOUSLY TRUE there.** It is `Function.Injective rosterHash` on the INFINITE `List Guardian` into a
BOUNDED digest: `Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded.rosterCR_false_blake3` / `_babyBear` refute it by the
`HashFloorHonesty` counting core (`docs/deos/VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2). It inherits the defect from
the `KeySetCR` shape it copied — the analogy was exact, and so is the refutation.

**The honest replacement is `Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded`** —
`recStateCommit_recovers_council_roster_advantage_bound`, from a REAL collision game (whose win
relation mentions the deployed `councilCommitOf` on real kernel states) via a REAL reduction, carrying
an explicit undischarged `Eff`. This def is KEPT so the record and the teeth stating things ABOUT it
keep compiling. -/

identity cells commit to rosters via `rosterHash`, equal verified roots recover the SAME guardian
ROSTER — not merely the same digest. So a verifier-only light client reads off the literal K-of-N
guardian set that authorized, with no host trust. Stacks the named roster CR on the StateCommit CR
set; no other assumption. -/

The binding has teeth: if a dishonest host substitutes the guardian council (to a sub-threshold or
attacker-controlled quorum), the `council_commit` register changes, so the published root MUST change
— the swap is visible to the verifier. This is the contrapositive of the binding lemma, and the
reason the recovery is light-client-UNFOOLABLE: the WHO cannot be silently rewritten. -/

/-! ## §3 — CONCRETE non-vacuity, both polarities (the binding has teeth on a real toy portal).

Reuse the SAME injective toy portal `StateCommit.§8` uses (`chConcrete`/`rhConcrete`/`cmbConcrete`/
`compressConcrete`/`compressNConcrete`) — so the divergence fires on a GENUINE binding commitment, not
a lossy `+`-fold. We exhibit an identity council cell and a guardian-SWAPPED variant: the swap changes
the `council_commit` register, hence the root (the tooth fires); the honest state commits to its own
root (the binding is reflexively inhabited).

The `council_commit` leaf must be VISIBLE to the toy leaf hash for the divergence to fire. The §8
`chConcrete = balOf` only sees `balance`, so here we use a council-aware leaf that also folds the
`council_commit` field — the same SHAPE the deployed Poseidon2 cell-leaf hash has (it hashes the whole
canonical `Value`, all fields), exhibited concretely. -/

/-- A council-aware concrete cell-leaf hash: an injective pairing of the `balance` and `council_commit`
fields (the deployed Poseidon2 leaf hashes the WHOLE canonical `Value`; this toy exhibits the two
fields the demo moves, injectively, so the swap is visible — NOT a lossy `+`). -/

/-! ## §4 — THE NAMED VK-AFFECTING DEPLOYMENT TAIL (for ember; NOT performed here).

The binding above is SOUND once the `council_commit` register exists as a committed cell field. The
deployment that makes it LIVE is VK-affecting and is NAMED, not laundered:

  1. **Host writes the register.** The recovery turn (`identity_social_recovery_e2e.rs`'s
     guardian-blessed `set_state`) must write `councilCommitField` on the identity cell — the digest
     of the HINTS guardian roster (the `dregg_federation` aggregate public key / roster commitment),
     the `next_keys_digest` shape (`PreRotation.rotateWrite`).
  2. **Descriptor binds the threshold check.** The recovery effect's circuit descriptor must bind the
     `Authorization::Custom -> ThresholdSigVerifier` check INTO the leaf the circuit commits, so a
     host cannot omit it and still produce an accepting root (the `Circuit-Soundness Apex` per-effect
     rung for the recovery effect — the obligation table in `.docs-history-noclaude/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md`).
  3. **Regenerate the VK + redeploy.** A new descriptor ⇒ a new verifying key ⇒ a redeploy of the
     live devnet verifier. This is the ember-gated step: do NOT regen the live VK / do NOT deploy
     here.

`CouncilCommitDeployTail` records this as a Prop-level checklist (a NAMED residual, with its closure
lane the apex per-effect rung), so the tail is tracked, not forgotten. -/

/-- **`CouncilCommitDeployTail` — the NAMED VK-affecting residual** (not performed here). The
conjunction of: the host writes the `council_commit` register on a guardian-blessed recovery; the
recovery descriptor binds the threshold check into the committed leaf; the VK is regenerated +
redeployed under ember's gate. The Lean foundation (§1–§3) proves the binding SOUND once these hold;
this Prop names what deployment still owes. -/
