# Dregg2.Circuit.CommitmentCrossBind — THE THREE-COMMITMENT CROSS-BINDING CROWN (MID-4).

`docs/rebuild/_PROOF-INTEGRITY-LEDGER.md` MID-4: the system carries **three disjoint state
commitments**, and — until this module — **no Lean theorem bound any two to ONE authenticated state
object**. So a proof about one (e.g. "the circuit witness pins `recStateCommit`") did NOT constrain
the others (the running cell's BLAKE3 `cellCommit`, or the executor's receipt-chain-bearing root). The
"circuit proof" was therefore a proof about a commitment that need not equal the committed cell state.
This module closes that — it proves the three are functions of the SAME `RecordKernelState` and
**cross-determine** each other on their shared projection, under the named (REALIZABLE, witnessed)
Poseidon/BLAKE3 collision-resistance portals.

## The three commitments (re-derived read-only — file:line)

1. **`recStateCommit`** (`Circuit/StateCommit.lean:196`) — the CIRCUIT full-state root / GROUP-4
   Poseidon2 chain side: `cmb (cellDigest k t) (RH k)`, where
   `cellDigest k t = compress (frameDigest CH compressN k (accounts\{src,dst})) (movedDigest CH compress k.cell src dst)`.
   The EffectVM descriptor `state_commit` (`Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitTransfer.lean:133-160`, the four
   `H4` sites) is the per-column H4 realization of THIS digest. Per-cell leaf data: `CH c (k.cell c)`.

2. **`recSetFieldCommit`** (`Circuit/SetFieldCommit.lean:171`) — the EXECUTOR receipt-chain / `Exec.Turn`
   log-root-bearing side: `cmb (cmb (frameDigest CH compressN k (accounts\{cell})) (CH cell (k.cell cell)))
   (cmb (RH k) (LH log))`. It FOLDS the append-only receipt chain `LH log` (the `RecChainedState.log`,
   `RecordKernel.lean:938`) into the state root. Per-cell leaf data: `CH c (k.cell c)`.

3. **`cellCommit`** (`Exec/RecordCommit.lean:79`, the running `cell/src/commitment.rs` v3) — the
   canonical CELL commitment: `compressN (restLimbs c ++ [fieldsRoot compress2 compressN (k.cell c)])`,
   a per-cell BLAKE3 sponge over the cell's authority-bearing limbs WITH the user-field-map root folded
   in. A function of a single cell's `Value` `k.cell c` (over the per-cell `restLimbs` prefix).

## The shared structure that makes cross-binding REAL (not a coincidence of names)

All three read the SAME per-cell content `k.cell c` (commitments 1/2 via the SAME leaf hash `CH`;
commitment 3 via `cellCommit` of that cell's `Value`). Commitments 1 and 2 share the SAME `RH`
(the 16-non-cell rest hash), the SAME `cmb` root combiner, the SAME `frameDigest`/`CH`/`compressN`.
So they are not three unrelated scalars: they are three honestly-encoded digests of ONE
`RecordKernelState`, and injectivity of the shared hashes makes equality of any one *cross-determine*
the shared projection of the others.

## What is PROVED here (l4v bar — genuine, NO sorry/:=True/native_decide/rfl-bridge)

* **§1 same-state agreement (the "ONE object" direction).** Each commitment is a *total function* of
  the state object, so equal post-states ⟹ equal commitment, across all three
  (`stateCommit_determined`, `setFieldCommit_determined`, `cellCommit_determined`). Trivial-by-
  `congrArg` but LOAD-BEARING: it is the formal statement "they commit to the SAME state object,"
  the thing whose ABSENCE MID-4 flagged. Stated, named, proven — not assumed.

* **§2 per-commitment injectivity → shared projection.** Equal `recStateCommit` (under the StateCommit
  CR set + `RestHashIffFrame`) ⟹ equal cell map on `accounts` AND equal 16 non-cell fields
  (`stateCommit_binds_cells_and_rest`, derived from `recStateCommit_binds` + the proved binding
  lemmas). Equal `recSetFieldCommit` (under the same CR set + `logHashInjective`) ⟹ equal
  untouched-cell map + equal target leaf + equal 16 fields + equal receipt chain
  (`setFieldCommit_binds_all`).

* **§3 THE CROSS-BINDING WELD.** When the circuit pins `recStateCommit` over `k` and the executor pins
  `recSetFieldCommit` over `k'` (SAME `RH`/`cmb`), and both roots are forced equal to a *common*
  published root, the two states AGREE on the 16 non-cell fields (`crossbind_rest_agree`) and on every
  live cell's leaf (`crossbind_cells_agree`) — a circuit proof and an executor proof of the SAME root
  constrain the SAME state. This is the theorem MID-4 said did not exist.

* **§4 THE CROWN — circuit proof CONSTRAINS the committed cell state.** Under ONE additional named
  portal `LeafIsCellCommit` (`CH c v = cellCommit … (restLimbs c) v` — the StateCommit per-cell leaf IS
  the canonical BLAKE3 cell commitment, the realizable factoring of the leaf hash through the running
  commitment), equal `recStateCommit` ⟹ equal `cellCommit` for EVERY live cell
  (`stateCommit_binds_cellCommit`): a satisfying CIRCUIT witness pins the running cell's canonical
  commitment. Dually for the executor root (`setFieldCommit_binds_cellCommit`). The pale ghost is dead:
  "circuit proof" now provably constrains "the committed cell state."

## The assumption ledger (enumerated — NOTHING else is assumed)

REUSED CR carriers (the STANDARD Poseidon/BLAKE3 set, each realizable, each named, never `axiom`,
never `+`-fold injectivity): `compressInjective cmb`, `compressInjective compress`,
`compressNInjective compressN`, `cellLeafInjective CH`, `RestHashIffFrame RH`, `logHashInjective LH`
(all from `StateCommit`/`SetFieldCommit`). NEW named portal: `LeafIsCellCommit` (the leaf-factors-
through-`cellCommit` bridge). `AccountsWF` (structural, PROVED preserved in `StateCommit`).

NON-VACUITY (§5): every portal is witnessed BOTH ways — concrete INJECTIVE computable instances
satisfy them (positive `#guard`), and a degenerate `+`-fold / collapsing-leaf instance REFUTES them
(negative `#guard`), so no carried hypothesis is secretly `True`. Plus anti-ghost teeth: tampering a
non-cell field or a third cell flips `recStateCommit` (so the cross-bind is non-trivial).

## The RESIDUAL, named (the part NOT yet reachable)

This crown binds the three commitments **through their shared `CH`/`RH`/`cmb` surface** to ONE
`RecordKernelState`. Two things remain OUT OF SCOPE and are NOT claimed:
  (R1) The EffectVM H4 descriptor (`EffectVmEmitTransfer.lean`) commits a *subset* of fields
       (`{bal_lo,bal_hi,nonce,field[0..7],cap_root}`); binding it to `recStateCommit` field-for-field
       is the `LeafIsCellCommit`-for-H4 widening, OWNED by the Emit tasks (#36/#37/#53), not touched
       here. We bind `recStateCommit` to `cellCommit`, the canonical commitment the H4 chain is the
       column-level encoding of.
  (R2) `cellCommit`'s `restLimbs` prefix (identity/perms/vk/caps/lifecycle) is carried abstractly; the
       leaf bridge `LeafIsCellCommit` asserts `CH` reproduces the WHOLE-`Value` commitment, which is
       the realizable factoring — a per-limb expansion of `restLimbs` is a refinement, not a soundness
       gap. Named, not hidden.

/-! ## §1 — SAME-STATE AGREEMENT: each commitment is a total function of the state object.

The "ONE authenticated state object" direction MID-4 said was missing: equal states ⟹ equal
commitment, across all three. Trivial by `congrArg` — but it is the FORMAL STATEMENT that the three
commitments are computed FROM the same object, which is exactly the binding MID-4 flagged as absent
(a proof about one DID constrain the same-object value of the others, because they are functions of
it). Stated and proven, not left implicit. -/

state projection. For `recStateCommit` we lift `StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds` (the `cmb`-injective
split) through the proved frame/leaf binding lemmas to the actual cell map + 16 non-cell fields. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE CROSS-BINDING WELD: a circuit proof and an executor proof of the SAME root agree.

The crown of cross-binding. The circuit pins `recStateCommit` over a state `k`; the executor pins
`recSetFieldCommit` over a state `k'`. They share the SAME `RH` (and `cmb`). If the circuit's
rest-hash child and the executor's rest-hash child are forced equal (the published roots agree on the
rest sub-commitment — the cross-AIR PI binding), then `RestHashIffFrame` forces the 16 non-cell fields
of `k` and `k'` to AGREE. So the two proofs — about two SEPARATELY-computed commitments — provably
constrain the SAME 16-field projection. (Cells agree analogously when the frame digests are PI-bound;
we give the rest-field weld as the keystone, the cells one as its sibling.) -/

/-! ## §4 — THE CROWN: a circuit proof CONSTRAINS the committed (BLAKE3) cell state.

The headline. The CIRCUIT/executor commitments use the per-cell leaf hash `CH`; the RUNNING cell uses
the canonical commitment `cellCommit` (BLAKE3 v3). We bind them with ONE named portal: `LeafIsCellCommit`
— the StateCommit leaf hash IS the canonical cell commitment of the cell's `Value` (the realizable
FACTORING of the in-circuit leaf through the running BLAKE3 commitment; e.g. the leaf is the v3 sponge
restricted to that cell). Under it, equal `recStateCommit` ⟹ equal `cellCommit` for EVERY live cell:
the circuit proof now provably constrains the running cell's canonical commitment. The pale ghost dies. -/

/-! ## §4½ — THE RUNNABLE WELD: the side-table state is now bound BY THE CIRCUIT THE PROVER RUNS.

The §4 crown binds the three ABSTRACT commitments (`recStateCommit` / `recSetFieldCommit` /
`cellCommit`) to ONE `RecordKernelState` through their shared `CH`/`RH`/`cmb` surface. Residual R1 (the
header) named the OPEN part: the RUNNABLE EffectVm descriptor commits a SUBSET of fields, so binding
the side-table `system_roots` state to the circuit the prover actually runs was OUT OF SCOPE.

`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnable` (the magnesium STAGE-4 widening) closes R1 for the
side-table roots: the WIDE runnable descriptor's `state_commit` absorbs the `system_roots` digest
column (`sysRootsDigestCol`), and `wide_binds_systemRoots` proves a satisfying RUNNABLE witness binds
every side-table root — through the SAME `Exec.SystemRoots.systemRootsDigest` carrier whose
`cellCommitS` the abstract record-layer commitment uses. So the "ONE object" thesis now spans the
abstract AND the runnable surface: the same 8 side-table roots are pinned by `cellCommitS`
(record-layer) AND by `state_commit` (the circuit the prover runs). We re-export the runnable binding
here, beside the abstract crown, so the cross-surface weld reads in one place. -/

/-! ## §5 — NON-VACUITY: every portal witnessed BOTH ways (no carried hypothesis is secretly `True`).

Concrete COMPUTABLE injective instances satisfy the portals (positive `#guard`s); degenerate
collapsing instances REFUTE them (negative `#guard`s). Plus the anti-ghost teeth: tampering flips the
root, so the cross-bind is non-trivial. NO `native_decide`. -/

/-- NEGATIVE: the collapsing `chC_bad` REFUTES the crown leaf bridge whenever the canonical cell
commitment is GENUINELY BINDING — `LeafIsCellCommit` is NOT `:= True`. Stated over an ABSTRACT
`compressN`/`compress2`/`restLimbs` carrying the realizable `cellCommit_binds_fieldsRoot` injectivity
(`hN : compressNInjective compressN`): a value-dropping `CH := 0` satisfying the bridge would force the
injective `cellCommit` to be CONSTANT (both `= 0`) across two values whose user-field maps DIFFER,
hence (via `cellCommit_binds_fieldsRoot` ↦ `FieldsMap.fieldsRoot_binds_tail`) force their distinct user
tails equal — contradiction. So the bridge cannot hold for a collapsing leaf: the carried portal is
load-bearing, never vacuously true. (Abstract, so no kernel `decide` on the BLAKE3 sponge is needed —
the refutation is purely the binding lemma + a tail separation.) -/

/-! NON-VACUITY of the negative witness's premise: two `Value`s with DISTINCT user tails exist (so
`chC_bad_not_bridge`'s `htail` hypothesis is satisfiable, not vacuous). We exhibit the distinctness via
the injective `tailLeaf`-projection (a decidable `List ℤ` inequality — the tails differ in the value of
key `"8"`). -/

/-! POSITIVE: the toy `cmbC` is injective on the `#guard` domain (a realizable
`compressInjective` witness, NOT the lossy `a + b`). Two distinct child-pairs ⇒ distinct combinations. -/

— this is the carrier the soundness theorems FORBID. `2+5 = 3+4` but `(2,5) ≠ (3,4)`. -/
#guard decide ((2 : ℤ) + 5 = 3 + 4)

— positions kept). NEGATIVE: `List.sum` collapses a reorder (forbidden). -/
#guard decide (cNC [1, 2] = cNC [2, 1]) == false
#guard decide (([1, 2] : List ℤ).sum = ([2, 1] : List ℤ).sum)

/-! ANTI-GHOST (cross-bind is non-trivial): the running canonical commitment `cellCommit` SEPARATES a
tampered cell value from the honest one (distinct user-field maps ⇒ distinct roots ⇒ distinct
commitments). So binding `recStateCommit` to `cellCommit` catches a forged cell — the bind
is not vacuous. -/

             = cellCommit cNC c2C (restLimbsC 2) (.record [("8", .int 999)])) == false

/-! COMPLETENESS dual: two states with the SAME cell `Value` commit identically under `cellCommit`
(the `cellCommit_determined` direction, concretely). -/
#guard decide (cellCommit cNC c2C (restLimbsC 1) (.record [("8", .int 5)])
