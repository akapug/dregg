# Dregg2.Circuit.RotationLayout — THE ROTATED COMMITMENT LAYOUT (the one VK epoch's state shape).

The staged Lean expression of `docs/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.1/§2.4/§2.6 — the flag-day
commitment layout, expressed and PROVEN here BEFORE any wire flip (the live v1 path is untouched;
the cutover commit consumes this module's shape, `docs/ROTATION-CUTOVER.md`):

  * **registers 8 → 16** (§2.1): sixteen NAMED register limbs, direct in the commitment (the one
    state structure that is correctly NOT a map — `docs/EPOCH-DESIGN.md` §"Per-structure choices").
    `resolve` is the `FactoryDescriptor.fields` name-declaration semantics: a declared field name
    resolves to a register index, first-match, total on declared names (≤ 16) and injective on
    resolved indices (`resolve_total` / `resolve_inj`) — compilation resolves indices, the
    commitment binds the values (`rotatedCommit_binds_named_field`).
  * **the limb order** (`docs/EPOCH-DESIGN.md` §"The commitment layout", reconciled): cells root ·
    the 16 registers · the map roots ADJACENT AND UNIFORM (cap_root, nullifier_root, heap_root —
    the §2.4 `heap_root` limb) · lifecycle · epoch · committed height · the receipt-index root
    **literally LAST**. The index root is last because the NAMED obligations
    (`AttestedQuery.CommitBindsIndex`, `MMR.CommitBindsMMR`) pin the shape
    `commit = hash (limbs ++ [iroot])` — `rotatedCommit_binds_mmr` discharges `CommitBindsMMR`
    **by `rfl`** (the whole point of the layout). EPOCH-DESIGN's prose order placed
    lifecycle/epoch/height after the index root; the obligation's shape wins (dated note there).
  * **the committed-height limb** (§2.6, PI v3): `committed_height_not_prover_chosen` — two PI
    vectors bound to the same commitment agree on the height; the temporal gate's
    prover-chosen-height note closes at the flag-day by THIS pin. `PiV3` declares the v3 tail
    (committed-height column + rateBound/challengeWindow caveat tags) appended after the frozen
    v2 prefix (`V2_BASE_COUNT = 209` — drift-guarded by the Rust twin test
    `pi_v3_offsets_match_lean` in `circuit/src/effect_vm/pi.rs`).
  * **the anti-ghost keystone** (`rotatedCommit_binds`): under the ONE named CR floor, equal
    commits force equal limb structures AND equal receipt logs — tampering ANY limb (a register
    beyond the old 8, the heap root, the height) or ANY log position (truncate/extend/reorder,
    via `mroot_injective`) moves the commit. Witnessed executably both polarities (§5).

The four map-root limbs are DERIVED boundary views under the universal-memory restructure
(`Crypto/UniversalMemory.boundary_root_derived`, `Exec/UniversalBridge.cap_leaf_value_codec` /
`index_boundary_mroot_derived`) — derivation changes where they are computed, never what they
commit to; THIS module pins what the commitment absorbs.

Axiom hygiene: `#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; crypto only as the
named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis. Lean/design layer: no Rust rides this module until the
cutover commit regenerates descriptors against it.

SEMANTICS is first-match resolution into the 16-register file. `resolveFrom` is the recursion;
`resolve` clips to `Fin 16`. Total on declared names when ≤ 16 are declared; injective on
resolved indices WITHOUT any nodup hypothesis (first-match is injective by construction). The
Rust twin is `FactoryDescriptor::resolve_field` (`cell/src/factory.rs`). -/

The v3 tail appends THREE slots after the frozen v2 prefix (`pi.rs` `BASE_COUNT = 209` — the
Rust drift-guard test `pi_v3_offsets_match_lean` pins these numbers against this module, so a
v2-prefix drift fails loudly before the flag-day):

  * `COMMITTED_HEIGHT` — the height the commitment carries (the `committedHeight` limb's PI
    face). Closes the temporal gate's prover-chosen-height note: the verifier reads the height
    FROM the committed state, never from a prover-chosen scalar (`CURRENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT`, PI 18,
    stays as the verifier-supplied comparand).
  * `RATE_BOUND_TAG` / `CHALLENGE_WINDOW_TAG` — the caveat tags (`REORIENT.md:75-76`); the
    challengeWindow tag is what the optimistic proving mode reads (#169) — the tag ships at the
    flag-day, the mode ships later. -/
