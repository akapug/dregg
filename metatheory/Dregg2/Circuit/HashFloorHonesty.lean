# `Dregg2.Circuit.HashFloorHonesty` — the hash floors are INJECTIVITY, which is FALSE for a real
hash. FALSIFIABILITY TEETH + a PROPER computational collision-resistance floor.

## The bug this file documents (and forecloses)

The whole circuit-soundness tower conditions on hash floors stated as **injectivity**:

  * `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge := ∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys`
  * `StateCommit.compressNInjective h`         (the same predicate on `List ℤ → ℤ`)
  * `StateCommit.compressInjective h := ∀ a b c d, h a b = h c d → a = c ∧ b = d`  (2-to-1)
  * `HermineHintMLWE.HashCR cr := ∀ i w w', cr.H i w = cr.H i w' → w = w'`         (commit-reveal)

Every one is **FALSE for any real hash**: a sponge maps an *infinite* domain (`List ℤ`, `ℤ × ℤ`, a
compressing `W`) into a *bounded* field element, so collisions **exist by cardinality / pigeonhole**.
Collision-resistance means collisions are hard to **FIND**, never that they don't **EXIST**. So every
theorem conditioned on one of these predicates is **VACUOUSLY TRUE at real parameters** — the
hypothesis is unsatisfiable. `#assert_axioms` is blind to it: the proofs are clean; the *hypothesis*
is the flaw.

The pre-existing "non-vacuity" witnesses (`FloorsNonVacuous.encodeSponge_cr`,
`Poseidon2Binding.Reference.refSponge_CR`) give FALSE COMFORT: they satisfy the floor with a **toy
injective** sponge (`Encodable.encode`, an injection into ALL of `ℤ`), while the REAL compressing
Poseidon2 refutes it. Toy witness satisfiable; real instantiation false.

## What this file provides

  * **§1 — FALSIFIABILITY TEETH.** The floors are proved **FALSE** for any range-bounded hash, by a
    cardinality / pigeonhole argument (`not_injective_of_finite_range` and its four specializations).
    You do NOT need an actual Poseidon2 collision — counting suffices, and is the honest statement.
    This is ember's "prove load-bearing specs true AND FALSE" discipline; nobody had tried to prove
    the floor FALSE, which is why the bug survived.

  * **§2 — PROPER COMPUTATIONAL COLLISION-RESISTANCE.** `CollisionResistant F` for a **keyed** hash
    family `F` (indexed by the security parameter): every collision-finding adversary's advantage —
    the `winProb` that it outputs a genuine collision, over a uniformly random key — is `Negl`. This
    is a REAL assumption (the tree's `ProbCrypto.winProb` / `ConcreteSecurity.Negl` machinery):
    satisfiable at real params, NOT provable, and genuinely computational — the advantage measures
    the adversary *finding* a collision, not the mere *existence* of one (`mod2_dumb_negligible`
    exhibits collisions that exist while a specific finder's advantage is `0`). Keying is what makes
    the game meaningful: an unkeyed fixed hash lets an adversary hardcode a known collision (advantage
    `1`) — exactly the degeneracy that makes the OLD injective floor, and `FloorBridge`'s canonical
    collision family, collapse.

  * **§3 — THE ADVANTAGE-BOUNDED RESTATEMENT.** Under proper CR the binding keystones survive as
    advantage bounds: an equivocating opener IS a collision finder, so "two openings ⟹ equal" becomes
    "⟹ equal EXCEPT with negligible probability" (`equivocation_advantage_negligible`); and a
    multi-round FRI/STARK soundness error is a finite SUM of per-round collision advantages, negligible
    by `negl_finset_sum` (`friFold_advantage_negligible`). This is the template every `HashCR` /
    `Poseidon2SpongeCR` consumer (`FriSoundness.oracle_binding`, `AirSoundness.committed_trace_pinned`,
    `FinBindsKernel`, the `StarkSound` chain) re-derives through — the Boolean "= equal" becomes a
    negligible advantage term, threaded additively.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; NO `sorryAx`/`sorry`, NO fresh `axiom`,
NO `def …Hard` used as a hypothesis. The proper floor is REFUTED on broken families and SATISFIED on
an injective one, so it is neither vacuous nor trivially true. NEW file; the old defs are KEPT
(doc-marked BROKEN beside the pointer to these teeth) — the record matters.

/-! ## §1 — FALSIFIABILITY TEETH: the injective floors are FALSE for any range-bounded hash.

The core is a single cardinality fact: an INJECTIVE function from an INFINITE domain must have an
INFINITE range. A real hash's range is a bounded field, hence finite — contradiction. Every floor is
a specialization. -/

/-- **The counting core.** A function from an infinite type whose RANGE is finite is NOT injective.
(If it were, the corestriction to its range would inject the infinite domain into a finite set.) This
is the honest content behind "a compressing hash has collisions" — pure cardinality, no Poseidon2
collision exhibited. -/

/-- **TOOTH 1 — `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is FALSE for a range-bounded sponge.** Any sponge that lands in a
finite set of field elements is non-injective on the infinite `List ℤ`, so it CANNOT satisfy the

`hash_many` — refutes `Poseidon2SpongeCR`. The injective floor is not merely un-proven for the real

/-- **TOOTH 2 — `StateCommit.compressInjective` is FALSE for a range-bounded 2-to-1 compression.** A
Poseidon2 node compress `ℤ × ℤ → ℤ` into a bounded field cannot be injective on the infinite `ℤ × ℤ`:

larger than the commitment space `C` (`|C| < |W|` — the defining property of a commitment/compression),
then at every index the hash pins two distinct reveals to one commitment (pigeonhole). So a real
compressing commit-reveal refutes the injective `HashCR` floor. -/

/-! ## §2 — PROPER computational collision-resistance (a REAL, satisfiable, non-trivial floor).

The honest replacement for injectivity: a KEYED hash family and an advantage that measures the
adversary *finding* a collision over a uniformly random key. The key (realized in the deployed system
by domain separation and the security-parameter growth) is what stops the "hardcode a known collision"
degeneracy that collapses the unkeyed injective floor. -/

/-- A **keyed hash family**: at each security parameter `n` a finite, inhabited key space `Key n` and a

The old injective floor implies the proper floor (an injective per-key hash has no collisions, hence
advantage `0` — `injective_family_CR`). But injectivity is FALSE for the real hash (§1). So the tower
rested on a hypothesis strictly stronger than needed AND unsatisfiable; the proper floor is the
satisfiable object the same reductions actually need. -/

/-! ## §3 — the ADVANTAGE-BOUNDED restatement of the binding keystones.

Under proper CR the Boolean "two openings ⟹ equal" (`commitment_binding`, `oracle_binding`) restates
as "⟹ equal EXCEPT with negligible probability": an equivocating opener IS a collision finder, so its
success is negligible. And a multi-round FRI/STARK soundness error is a finite SUM of per-round
collision advantages, negligible by `negl_finset_sum`. -/

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE-BOUNDED COMMITMENT BINDING.** An equivocation adversary — one that, per key, opens
one commitment to two DISTINCT reveals colliding under the hash — IS a `CollisionFinder`; under proper
CR its advantage is negligible. This is the concrete-security form of
`HermineHintMLWE.commitment_binding` / `FriSoundness.oracle_binding`: the Boolean "opens ⟹ equal"
becomes "opens ⟹ equal except with negligible probability". The equivocation event is definitionally
the collision the floor bounds. -/

/-- **THE ADDITIVE SOUNDNESS-ERROR COMBINATOR (the FRI/STARK re-derivation template).** A protocol with
`rounds` Merkle-binding checks (each `HashCR`-consuming leg of the FRI fold / STARK oracle chain) has a
total binding-failure advantage equal to the SUM of the per-round collision advantages. If each round's
finder advantage is negligible (proper CR at each round), the total is negligible. This is how the
whole `StarkSound` / FRI-proximity chain re-derives on the proper floor: every `HashCR` use becomes a
negligible advantage term, threaded ADDITIVELY across rounds — the Boolean chain's "no equivocation"
becomes "negligible total equivocation probability". -/
