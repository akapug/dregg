# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementExerciseAuth — the exercise HOLD-GATE, FORCED in-circuit via
  the deployed depth-16 cap-open membership (`CapOpenEmit.effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`), and the inner-fold
  connected to the WHOLE-TURN closed forest.

## What this closes (the exercise AUTHORITY residual)

`RotatedKernelRefinementExercise.lean` assembled `ExerciseSpec` from three NAMED legs — `facetMask`,
`holdGate`, `innerFold` — but carried the **hold-gate** `exerciseGuard pre actor target` as a bare
`Prop` HYPOTHESIS (`exerciseEncodes.holdGate`), discharged only by reference to "the deployed cap-open".
This module DISCHARGES it: the hold-gate IS a cap MEMBERSHIP (`(caps actor).any (confersEdgeTo target)`),
and the deployed cap-open (the live cap-open membership (`effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`/`capOpenEff_membership`)) FORCES that membership in-circuit — exactly the
template `RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.TransferAuthoritySource` uses to force `authorizedFacetB` for
transfer. We build `ExerciseHoldSource`, the cap-open authority bundle for exercise, and DERIVE the
hold-gate from it (NOT a carried field).

## The two halves, each PRECISELY placed

  1. **AUTHORITY (the hold-gate)** — `ExerciseHoldSource` (DATA-bearing, like `TransferAuthoritySource`)
     bundles the cap-open `Satisfied2` witness + chip-soundness + the row index, from which
     the live cap-open membership (`effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`/`capOpenEff_membership`) FORCES the deployed membership `MembersAt cap_root leaf ∧ leaf.target =
     target ∧ confersTransferLeaf leaf` IN-CIRCUIT. The lift from this DEPLOYED membership to the toy
     `exerciseGuard` (a `(caps actor).any (confersEdgeTo target)` over the toy `Caps` function) is the
     FAITHFUL cap-tree↔kernel-`Caps` encoding `ExerciseHoldFaithful` — the SAME residual class
     `DeployedFaithful` occupies for transfer (a HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom, never a fake). So the
     hold-gate's MEMBERSHIP is now circuit-FORCED; only the toy↔deployed encoding is the named carrier.

  2. **VALUE (the inner fold)** — `turnSpec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post` is the recursion
     through the carried inner action list. Each inner step is its OWN per-row descriptor; the
     inner-fold admissibility is the WHOLE-TURN closed forest fold
     (`CircuitSoundness.turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) applied to the inner chain. We state this
     CONNECTION precisely (`exercise_innerFold_rides_forest`): the inner fold IS a `turnSpec` over
     `fullActionStep`, which is exactly what the forest fold produces — so the inner-fold rides the SAME
     closed apex RECURSIVELY, with the recursion bound = the inner chain LENGTH (`inner.length`, a
     structurally-decreasing measure: each inner step is a strictly-smaller `FullActionA` list). It is
     NOT laundered as bound by THIS row; it is the forest composition of the inner steps, named with its
     bound.

## The honest class

exercise is now **AUTHORITY-FORCED (the hold-gate membership in-circuit) + the toy↔deployed cap encoding
the named carrier + the inner-fold connected to the closed forest (recursion bound = inner length)**.
The negative test (`exercise_holdSource_rejects_unheld`) BITES: an actor whose cap-open membership does
NOT confer an edge to `target` cannot derive the hold-gate — the in-circuit open refuses it.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} + the named cap-hash carriers inherited
through `CapOpenEmit` (the `ChipTableSound` chip-soundness, the `Compress1CR`/`chipCR` cap-hash CR).

/-! ## §1 — the exercise hold-gate authority source (the cap-open bundle).

`ExerciseHoldSource` is the exercise analog of `RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.TransferAuthoritySource`:
it bundles the prover's IN-CIRCUIT cap-tree opening for the exercise's hold-gate — the cap-open
`Satisfied2` witness whose opened leaf confers an authority edge to `target` — TOGETHER with the
FAITHFUL encoding carrier that lifts the deployed membership to the toy `exerciseGuard`. The deployed
membership is FORCED by the circuit (the live cap-open membership (`effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`/`capOpenEff_membership`)); the toy↔deployed encoding is the named
residual the ledger commitment cannot certify. -/

/-- **`ExerciseHoldFaithful pre actor target leaf` — the toy↔deployed hold-gate encoding (NAMED).** A
deployed cap-tree membership of `leaf` conferring an edge to `target` (the cap-open's in-circuit output)
witnesses the TOY hold-gate `exerciseGuard pre actor target` (`(caps actor).any (confersEdgeTo
target)`). This is the FAITHFUL cap-tree↔kernel-`Caps` encoding — the SAME residual class
`DeployedCapTree.DeployedFaithful` occupies for transfer authority (a HYPOTHESIS the honest prover's
real cap-tree realizes, never an axiom). Carried as a `Prop` field, NOT discharged here. -/
structure ExerciseHoldFaithful (pre : RecChainedState) (actor target : CellId)
    (leaf : CapLeaf) : Prop where

/-- **`ExerciseHoldSource pre actor target` — the cap-open hold-gate source (DATA-bearing, NAMED).**
The realizability of the prover's IN-CIRCUIT cap-tree opening for the exercise hold-gate: a cap-open
`Satisfied2` witness of the live descriptor (against a sound chip table) at row `i`, whose opened leaf's
target-column IS the exercise `target`, plus the faithful encoding (`ExerciseHoldFaithful`) lifting the
deployed membership to the toy `exerciseGuard`. The hold-gate membership is FORCED from these (via
the live cap-open membership (`effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`/`capOpenEff_membership`)); only the toy↔deployed encoding is the carried residual — exactly as
`TransferAuthoritySource` carries `DeployedFaithful`. DATA-bearing (`Type`, like `rotatedEncodes`). -/

/-- **`exercise_holdGate_forced` — the cap-open FORCES the exercise hold-gate (in-circuit membership).**
From an `ExerciseHoldSource`, the toy hold-gate `exerciseGuard pre actor target` HOLDS: the in-circuit
depth-16 cap-membership open (the live cap-open membership (`effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`/`capOpenEff_membership`)) forces the deployed membership conferring a
`target` edge, and the faithful encoding (`hfaith`) lifts it to the toy hold-gate. The hold-gate's
MEMBERSHIP is NOT carried as a `Prop` hypothesis — it is FORCED by the circuit (only the toy↔deployed
encoding is the named carrier). -/

    (src0 : ExerciseHoldSource pre actor target) :

/-! ## §2 — the exercise refinement with the hold-gate FORCED (not carried).

`exerciseEncodesAuth` repoints the exercise decode's hold-gate onto the cap-open source: instead of the
bare `holdGate : exerciseGuard` field, it carries the `ExerciseHoldSource` (the FORCED membership) +
the facet-mask + the inner fold. The hold-gate is DERIVED from the source. -/

/-- **`exerciseEncodesAuth` — the exercise decode with the hold-gate FORCED by the cap-open.** The
facet-mask + the inner fold ARE the other two `ExerciseSpec` legs; the hold-gate is replaced by the
`ExerciseHoldSource` (the in-circuit cap-membership open). DATA-bearing (`Type`, since it carries the
cap-open trace). -/
structure exerciseEncodesAuth (pre post : RecChainedState) (actor target : CellId)
    (inner : List FullActionA) : Type 1 where
  /-- the R4 facet-mask admittance (the named per-inner-row facet residual, unchanged). -/

  /-- the hold-gate AUTHORITY SOURCE — the in-circuit cap-open membership (FORCED, not carried). -/
  holdSource : ExerciseHoldSource pre actor target
  /-- the inner fold from the hold post-state (the named per-row inner-fold residual; §3 connects it to
  the closed forest). -/
  innerFold : turnSpec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post

/-- **`exerciseEncodesAuth_to_exerciseEncodes` — the forced decode lowers to the carried decode.** The
cap-open source DISCHARGES the hold-gate (`exercise_holdGate_forced`), so the forced decode produces the
carried `exerciseEncodes` of `RotatedKernelRefinementExercise` — with the hold-gate now FORCED rather
than assumed. The two facet/inner legs are shared. -/
theorem exerciseEncodesAuth_to_exerciseEncodes (pre post : RecChainedState) (actor target : CellId)

    exerciseEncodes pre post actor target inner :=
  { facetMask := henc.facetMask
  , holdGate := exercise_holdGate_forced pre actor target henc.holdSource
  , innerFold := henc.innerFold }

/-- **`exercise_descriptorRefines_auth` — THE EXERCISE REFINEMENT, HOLD-GATE NOW FORCED.** A satisfying
exercise row whose hold-gate rides the cap-open source forces `ExerciseSpec pre actor target inner
post`: the hold-gate membership is FORCED by the in-circuit cap-open (`exercise_holdGate_forced`), the
facet-mask + inner fold are the other two legs. This UPGRADES the exercise rung's hold-gate from a
carried `Prop` to a circuit-forced cap-membership — exactly the transfer Facet template. -/
theorem exercise_descriptorRefines_auth (pre post : RecChainedState) (actor target : CellId)

    (exerciseEncodesAuth_to_exerciseEncodes pre post actor target inner henc)

/-- **`exercise_descriptorRefines_auth_execFullA` — the refinement against the executor arm.** The
forced decode yields a genuine committed exercise (`execFullA pre (.exerciseA actor target inner) =
some post`) — the hold-gate discharged in-circuit. -/

    pre post actor target inner
    (exerciseEncodesAuth_to_exerciseEncodes pre post actor target inner henc)

/-! ## §3 — the inner-fold rides the WHOLE-TURN closed forest (the recursion bound NAMED).

The inner fold `turnSpec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post` is the recursion through the carried
inner action list. It is NOT bound by THIS exercise row's descriptor — it is the forest composition of
the inner steps, each its own per-row descriptor. We state the CONNECTION precisely: the inner fold IS a
`Spec.Turn.turnSpec fullActionStep`-fold (via `ActionDispatch.turnSpec_eq_spec`), which is EXACTLY what
the whole-turn closed forest (`CircuitSoundness.turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) produces. The
recursion BOUND is the inner chain LENGTH `inner.length` — a structurally-decreasing measure (each inner
step peels one `FullActionA`, so the inner fold terminates and rides the SAME closed apex recursively). -/

/-- **`exercise_innerFold_rides_forest` — the inner fold IS the generic `turnSpec` fold (the forest
shape).** The exercise inner fold `turnSpec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post` is precisely
`Spec.Turn.turnSpec fullActionStep (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post` — the SAME per-step
`fullActionStep` fold the whole-turn closed forest (`turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) produces. So the
inner-fold admissibility rides the SAME closed apex RECURSIVELY: each inner step is its own per-row
descriptor, composed by the forest fold over the inner chain. The recursion is well-founded on
`inner.length` (each cons peels one action). -/
theorem exercise_innerFold_rides_forest (pre post : RecChainedState) (actor : CellId)
    (inner : List FullActionA)
    (hfold : turnSpec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post) :
    Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.Turn.turnSpec fullActionStep (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post :=
  (Dregg2.Circuit.ActionDispatch.turnSpec_eq_spec (exerciseHoldState pre actor) inner post).mp hfold

/-- **`exercise_innerFold_recursion_bound` — the inner-fold recursion is bounded by the inner length.**
The inner fold over a `cons` chain exhibits a head step (`fullActionStep` — its OWN per-row descriptor)
and a STRICTLY-SHORTER tail fold (`turnSpec` over `inner` with `inner.length < (a :: inner).length`).
This exhibits the structurally-decreasing recursion measure: the inner-fold rides the closed apex
recursively, each level reducing the chain length by one, terminating at the empty chain (`turnSpec st
[] st' ↔ st = st'`). NOT laundered as bound by THIS row — the bound is the inner chain length. -/

/-! ## §4 — the NEGATIVE test: an actor whose cap-open does NOT confer a `target` edge is REJECTED. -/

/-- **`exercise_holdSource_rejects_unheld` (the NEGATIVE TEST — the hold-gate BITES in-circuit).** If the
actor does NOT hold a cap conferring an edge to `target` (`¬ exerciseGuard pre actor target`), then NO
`ExerciseHoldSource` exists: the source would FORCE the hold-gate (`exercise_holdGate_forced`),
contradicting the assumption. So an exercise whose actor lacks the conferring cap cannot ride a cap-open
authority source — the in-circuit cap-membership open refuses it (the hold-gate the live descriptor's
toy-cap field merely ASSUMED is now circuit-FORCED). -/

/-- **`exercise_descriptorRefines_auth_rejects_unheld` (the refinement-level tooth).** A forced exercise
decode whose actor lacks the conferring cap is UNSAT — the cap-open source cannot exist (the hold-gate
membership the cap-open forces would contradict the unheld assumption). -/

/-! ## §6 — THE DEDICATED EXERCISE CAP-OPEN DESCRIPTOR (`exerciseCapOpenV3`) — the last named cap-open
residual CLOSED on its OWN descriptor (not the attenuate stand-in).

§1–§4 rode `attenuateCapOpenEffV3` as a generic membership carrier. This section repoints the exercise
hold-gate onto the DEDICATED `Emit.CapOpenEmit.exerciseCapOpenV3` (the frozen exercise base + the
authority appendix at `EFF_EXERCISE`, the LIVE descriptor the SDK route
`exerciseViaCapabilityCapOpenVmDescriptor2R24` proves through). The `Satisfied2 exerciseCapOpenV3` is what
the light client verifies; the apex (`exercise_closedLog_capOpenSat`, ClosureAll) wires THIS — so
editing/removing the crown from `exerciseCapOpenV3` REDS the apex. -/

/-- **`ExerciseHoldSourceV3 pre actor target` — the DEDICATED-descriptor exercise hold-gate source.** As
`ExerciseHoldSource`, but the cap-open `Satisfied2` witness is of the LIVE dedicated `exerciseCapOpenV3`
descriptor (column layout at `exerciseV3.traceWidth`), NOT the attenuate stand-in. The in-circuit
depth-16 open forces `leaf.target = target ∧ confersTransferLeaf leaf`; the faithful encoding
(`ExerciseHoldFaithful`) lifts it to the toy `exerciseGuard`. DATA-bearing (`Type`). -/

/-- **`exerciseHoldSourceV3_to_holdSource` — the dedicated source IS an `ExerciseHoldSource`.** The
dedicated `exerciseCapOpenV3` strips (via `capOpen_satisfied2_strips_to_base`) to the bare `exerciseV3`
base; the attenuate-stand-in `ExerciseHoldSource` opened at `attenuateV3.traceWidth`, but the dedicated
source opens at the SAME-shaped `exerciseV3.traceWidth` — so we re-bundle directly, carrying the
dedicated `Satisfied2`'s membership. The hold-gate FORCE goes through `exercise_holdGate_forced` on the
