# Dregg2.Circuit.DeployedCapTree — THE FAITHFUL model of the DEPLOYED 7-field cap-tree.

## Why this file exists (the authority-leg ground-truth correction)

The kernel-authority bridge (`Dregg2.Circuit.CapRootBridge`) and the in-circuit non-amplification
proofs (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.attenuateV3_non_amp`) discharge their cap-openings against
`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`, whose denotation is `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap`:

    opensTo hash r k o := ∃ h : FeltHeap, SortedKeys h ∧ Heap.root hash h = r ∧ Heap.get h k = o
    Heap.root hash h   := hash (h.map (fun e => hash [e.1, e.2]))           -- FLAT sponge, 2-field leaf

That model is a FLAT SPONGE of a sorted list of **2-field** leaves `hash[addr, value]`.

The value the CELL actually commits (and the EffectVM circuit seeds `cap_root` from) is
`dregg_cell::compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` → `circuit/src/cap_root.rs::CanonicalCapTree`:

    leaf  = cap_chip_absorb[slot_hash, target, auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi, expiry, breadstuff] -- 7 fields
    node  = cap_chip_absorb[FACT_MARK, left, right]                                            -- arity-3
    root  = the depth-16 BINARY MERKLE fold of the sorted-by-slot_hash padded leaf list

## The unification (THIS revision — decision #1, the chip-rate gap CLOSED)

`circuit/src/cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb` is now the SINGLE in-circuit hash the cap-tree commits to:
ONE width-16 Poseidon2 permutation, byte-identical to the IR-v2 Poseidon2 chip's BUS_P2 absorb
(`descriptor_ir2.rs::Ir2Air::Chip`). The chip distinguishes two seedings by `big = [arity == 7]`:

  * `arity ≤ 4` (rate-4 regime): `state[0..len] = ins`, `state[4] = len` (the length tag),
    `state[5..] = 0`. The cap NODE rides this as the arity-3 absorb of `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`.
  * `arity == 7` (rate-8 leaf): `state[0..7] = ins`, NO tag lane (`state[7..] = 0`). The cap LEAF
    rides this as the arity-7 absorb of the 7 leaf fields.

So the deployed leaf and node are BOTH a single chip-realizable permutation call. We model the one
hash as `Dregg2.Crypto.CommitmentBinding.Compress1CR` — ONE permutation call (`squeeze ∘ perm ∘
absorb`), the same primitive #4 the 2-to-1 Merkle node `hash_2_to_1` rides — and define BOTH
`capLeafDigest` and `nodeOf` OVER it. Because the leaf-field list (length 7) and the node block
`[FACT_MARK, l, r]` (length 3) are length-disjoint, the chip's per-row `(arity, padded ins)` seeding
separates the two domains for free; `Compress1CR` (equal output ⇒ equal input list) is exactly the
chip's per-row collision-resistance.

This makes the IR-v2 chip GENUINELY realize the deployed cap hash: `DeployedCapOpen`'s
`SchemeRealizedByChip sponge S` is now PROVABLE (the chip's rate-8 absorb IS the deployed scheme, by
construction), so it is DISCHARGED, not carried. The prior revision's rate-4 `hash_many` leaf +
capacity-tagged `hash_fact` node (the source of the gap) are GONE.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY as the named
`Compress1CR` floor (the SAME single-permutation-call floor #4 the whole commitment tower carries).
No `sorry`, no `:= True`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the deployed node layout (the arity-3 chip absorb `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`).

`cap_root.rs::cap_node` folds each internal node as `cap_chip_absorb(&[CAP_FACT_MARK, l, r])` — the
arity-3 (rate-4 regime) single chip absorb. `FACT_MARK = 0xFACF` rides RATE lane 0 (a genuine rate
input, NOT a capacity tag), `l` lane 1, `r` lane 2, the length tag `3` in lane 4. So
`nodeOf l r = chipAbsorb [FACT_MARK, l, r]`, one permutation call over the length-3 block. -/

(`cap_root.rs::cap_node` = `cap_chip_absorb(&[CAP_FACT_MARK, l, r])`). `FACT_MARK` at rate lane 0,
`l` at 1, `r` at 2 — a genuine rate-input list, length 3 (length-disjoint from the length-7 leaf

/-! ## §2 — the `CapHashScheme` bundle: the ONE deployed chip-absorb carrier.

The deployed cap tree commits ONE hash everywhere — `cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb`, the IR-v2 chip's
single rate-8 absorb. Both the leaf (arity 7) and the node (arity 3) ride this one permutation call.
We bundle exactly that carrier. -/

/-- **`CapHashScheme State`** — the deployed cap-tree's SINGLE Poseidon2 carrier: the chip absorb
`chipAbsorb : List ℤ → ℤ` (`cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb` = the IR-v2 chip's `squeeze ∘ perm ∘
(state from arity+inputs)`), collision-resistant per row (`Compress1CR`, primitive #4 — equal output
forces equal input list, which is exactly the chip's per-row `(arity, padded inputs)` injectivity).
The `State` parameter is vestigial (the carrier is the per-row compression); the deployment instance
is the real BabyBear width-16 permutation. `nodeOf`/`capLeafDigest` are defined over it. -/

  /-- The single chip-absorb compression (`cap_chip_absorb`, `squeeze ∘ perm ∘ stateFromArityInputs`),

/-! ## §3 — the re-grounded primitives (`capLeafDigest`/`nodeOf` BOTH ride `chipAbsorb`). -/

/-- **`capLeafDigest S l`** — the 7-field deployed leaf digest, the SINGLE rate-8 chip absorb over the
7 leaf fields in canonical order. BYTE-IDENTICAL to `cap_root.rs::CapLeaf::digest`
(`cap_chip_absorb(&[slot_hash, target, auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi, expiry, breadstuff])` — ONE
permute, lanes 0..6 the genuine fields, no length tag, the chip's `big` row). -/
def capLeafDigest (l : CapLeaf) : ℤ := S.chipAbsorb (leafFields l)

/-- **`nodeOf S l r`** — the internal node hash, the arity-3 chip absorb over `packNode l r =
[FACT_MARK, l, r]`. BYTE-IDENTICAL to `cap_root.rs::cap_node` (`cap_chip_absorb(&[CAP_FACT_MARK, l,
r])` — ONE permute, `FACT_MARK` at rate lane 0). The SAME `chipAbsorb` carrier as the leaf — one cap
hash everywhere. -/
def nodeOf (l r : ℤ) : ℤ := S.chipAbsorb (packNode l r)

/-! ## §4 — injectivity (over the single chip-absorb carrier). -/

/-! ## §5 — the membership opening (the depth-16 binary-Merkle recompose up a sibling path).

A membership witness is a list of `(sibling, direction)` steps (`cap_root.rs::prove_membership`
returns exactly `(siblings, directions)`; `directions[i] = 0` ⇔ the current node is the LEFT child
at level `i`). Recomposing folds `nodeOf` up the path, mixing `(cur, sib)` by the direction bit —
LITERALLY the `descriptor_ir2` MapOps AIR's `mix` closure (`descriptor_ir2.rs:2109`):
`left = (1-dir)·cur + dir·sib`, `right = (1-dir)·sib + dir·cur`. -/

/-- One Merkle path step: the sibling digest at this level + the direction bit. -/
structure Step where
  /-- The sibling digest at this level (`cap_root.rs` `siblings[level]`). -/
  sib : ℤ
  /-- The direction bit: `0` ⇒ `cur` is the LEFT child (sibling right), `1` ⇒ right child. -/
  dir : Bool
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- **`recomposeUp S cur path`** — fold the held digest up the sibling/direction path to the root. At
each level, if `dir = false` (LEFT child) the node is `nodeOf cur sib`, else `nodeOf sib cur`. This is
the exact `attenuation_witness` / MapOps-AIR fold (`cap_root.rs:425-431`, `descriptor_ir2.rs:2116`),
now over the deployed capacity-tagged `nodeOf`. -/
def recomposeUp (cur : ℤ) : List Step → ℤ
  | [] => cur
  | s :: rest =>
    recomposeUp (if s.dir then nodeOf S s.sib cur else nodeOf S cur s.sib) rest

/-- **`MembersAt S root leaf`** — the deployed-tree membership statement: there is a sibling/direction
path recomposing `root` from the 7-field leaf's digest. The witness is the path
(`cap_root.rs::prove_membership`); the relation hides it behind the existential, exactly as the
in-circuit opening realizes it. The HONEST replacement for `Substrate.Heap`'s flat-sponge `opensTo` —
the REAL rate-4 leaf digest and the REAL capacity-tagged `hash_fact` binary fold. -/
def MembersAt (root : ℤ) (leaf : CapLeaf) : Prop :=
  ∃ path : List Step, recomposeUp S (capLeafDigest S leaf) path = root

/-- **`recomposeUp` is injective in its STARTING digest under the node CR** — equal recomposed roots
from the SAME path force the same starting leaf digest (peel each level by `nodeOf_injective`). The
anti-ghost spine: a prover cannot keep the published root while swapping the opened leaf along a fixed
path. -/

/-! ## §6 — the FAITHFUL commitment relation + the authority bridge against THIS tree.

The replacement for `CapRootBridge.CapsEncodes` (which is over `Substrate.Heap`). `DeployedEncodes`
says `cap_root` is the deployed `CanonicalCapTree`-root of a leaf set that FAITHFULLY realizes the
kernel `caps`: a write-rights membership opening of an authority-edge leaf witnesses a real held
endpoint cap. We carry the faithfulness as the runtime-encoding contract, exactly the
`compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` discipline. -/

/-! ### §6.0 — the FAITHFUL two-axis leaf decode (THE CUTOVER, FacetAuthority §10(C)).

The deployed leaf commits the authority on TWO axes, both in the 7-field leaf (`cap_root.rs:41-51`):
a FACET (`mask_lo`/`mask_hi`, two 16-bit limbs of one `EffectMask` u32) and a TIER (`auth_tag`, the
`AuthRequired` byte None=0…Custom=5). The cutover decodes BOTH off the leaf and gates the turn on
`authorizedFacetB` — NOT the toy `mask_lo == write-mask` shadow. -/

/-- **`maskOfLimbs lo hi`** — recombine the deployed split mask `(mask_lo, mask_hi)` into the one
`EffectMask` `u32`: `mask = mask_lo + mask_hi · 2^16` (`cap_root.rs::split_effect_mask`: `lo = mask &
0xFFFF`, `hi = (mask >> 16) & 0xFFFF`). The leaf-faithful inverse of the deployed limb split. -/
def maskOfLimbs (lo hi : ℤ) : ℤ := lo + hi * 65536

/-- **`tierOfTag tag`** — decode the deployed `auth_tag` BYTE to an `AuthTier` (`cap_root.rs:46`:
None=0…Custom=5; `AuthTier.tierByte` is the forward map). The IPC tiers (None…Impossible) decode by
the discriminant byte; tag `5` decodes to a `Custom` whose `vkHash` is the residual felt-absorb
(carried as `vkOfTag`, the one named crypto residual — transfers never use `Custom`, see §10). -/

  | 0 => .none
  | 1 => .signature
  | 2 => .proof
  | 3 => .either
  | 4 => .impossible
  | tag => .custom (vkOfTag tag)   -- tag = 5 (Custom): vkHash absorbed (NAMED residual `vkOfTag`)

/-- **`facetOfLeaf l`** — the leaf's decoded `Option EffectMask` facet: `some (maskOfLimbs mask_lo
mask_hi)` (the deployed `allowed_effects`; here always `some` — the leaf commits a concrete mask). -/
def facetOfLeaf (l : CapLeaf) : Option EffectMask := some (maskOfLimbs l.mask_lo l.mask_hi).toNat

/-- **`confersTransferLeaf vkOfTag provided l`** — THE FAITHFUL two-axis leaf gate (replaces the toy
`confersWriteLeaf`). The leaf confers TRANSFER authority iff (1) its decoded FACET permits the
`EFFECT_TRANSFER` bit (`isEffectPermitted`, `facet.rs:123`) AND (2) its decoded TIER (`tierOfTag
auth_tag`) is satisfied by the auth the turn `provided` (`AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy`, `permissions.rs:33`).
This is the deployed `(allowed_effects, permissions)` authority core, decoded off the committed leaf. -/

/-- **`confersLeaf vkOfTag provided effectBit l`** (F6 — the GENERAL two-axis leaf gate). The
generalization of `confersTransferLeaf` from the pinned `EFFECT_TRANSFER` constant to an ARBITRARY
effect-kind bit `effectBit`: the leaf confers `effectBit` authority iff (1) its decoded FACET
(`facetOfLeaf`, the genuine `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi`) permits `effectBit` AND (2) its decoded
TIER (`tierOfTag auth_tag`, the genuine committed byte — NOT a constant) is satisfied by `provided`.

realizes the FACET caps `caps`: every TRANSFER-conferring member leaf at an `(actor ⇒ src)` edge is
backed by a real held `FacetCap` over `src` whose facet permits TRANSFER and whose tier is satisfied by
`provided`. The forward encoding contract (caps ⇒ tree); the bridge below reads it backward through one

ACTUAL effect, not the constant `EFFECT_TRANSFER`).

`DeployedFaithful`/`deployedCapOpen_implies_authorizedB` above pin the facet to `EFFECT_TRANSFER`, so
they only ever authorize transfer-facet caps. `DeployedFaithfulEff` carries the turn's ACTUAL
effect-kind bit `effectBit` and backs a `confersLeaf … effectBit` opening with a held cap whose facet

that edge, and the bridge firing; plus a witness-FALSE where the empty cap-table backs no opening. -/
