# Dregg2.Circuit.DeployedCapTree — THE FAITHFUL model of the DEPLOYED 7-field cap-tree.

## Why this file exists (the authority-leg ground-truth correction)

The kernel-authority bridge (`Dregg2.Circuit.CapRootBridge`) and the in-circuit non-amplification
proofs (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.attenuateV3_non_amp`) discharge their cap-openings against
`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`, whose denotation is `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap`:

    opensTo hash r k o := ∃ h : FeltHeap, SortedKeys h ∧ Heap.root hash h = r ∧ Heap.get h k = o
    Heap.root hash h   := hash (h.map (fun e => hash [e.1, e.2]))           -- FLAT sponge, 2-field leaf

That model is a FLAT SPONGE of a sorted list of **2-field** leaves `hash[addr, value]`.

The value the CELL actually commits (and the EffectVM circuit seeds `cap_root` from) is
`dregg_cell::compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` → `circuit/src/cap_root.rs::CanonicalCapTree`:

    leaf  = cap_chip_absorb[slot_hash, target, auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi, expiry, breadstuff] -- 7 fields
    node  = cap_chip_absorb[FACT_MARK, left, right]                                            -- arity-3
    root  = the depth-16 BINARY MERKLE fold of the sorted-by-slot_hash padded leaf list

## The unification (THIS revision — decision #1, the chip-rate gap CLOSED)

`circuit/src/cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb` is now the SINGLE in-circuit hash the cap-tree commits to:
ONE width-16 Poseidon2 permutation, byte-identical to the IR-v2 Poseidon2 chip's BUS_P2 absorb
(`descriptor_ir2.rs::Ir2Air::Chip`). The chip distinguishes two seedings by `big = [arity == 7]`:

  * `arity ≤ 4` (rate-4 regime): `state[0..len] = ins`, `state[4] = len` (the length tag),
    `state[5..] = 0`. The cap NODE rides this as the arity-3 absorb of `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`.
  * `arity == 7` (rate-8 leaf): `state[0..7] = ins`, NO tag lane (`state[7..] = 0`). The cap LEAF
    rides this as the arity-7 absorb of the 7 leaf fields.

So the deployed leaf and node are BOTH a single chip-realizable permutation call. We model the one
hash as `Dregg2.Crypto.CommitmentBinding.Compress1CR` — ONE permutation call (`squeeze ∘ perm ∘
absorb`), the same primitive #4 the 2-to-1 Merkle node `hash_2_to_1` rides — and define BOTH
`capLeafDigest` and `nodeOf` OVER it. Because the leaf-field list (length 7) and the node block
`[FACT_MARK, l, r]` (length 3) are length-disjoint, the chip's per-row `(arity, padded ins)` seeding
separates the two domains for free; `Compress1CR` (equal output ⇒ equal input list) is exactly the
chip's per-row collision-resistance.

This makes the IR-v2 chip GENUINELY realize the deployed cap hash: `DeployedCapOpen`'s
`SchemeRealizedByChip sponge S` is now PROVABLE (the chip's rate-8 absorb IS the deployed scheme, by
construction), so it is DISCHARGED, not carried. The prior revision's rate-4 `hash_many` leaf +
capacity-tagged `hash_fact` node (the source of the gap) are GONE.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; Poseidon2 CR enters ONLY as the named
`Compress1CR` floor (the SAME single-permutation-call floor #4 the whole commitment tower carries).

/-! ## §1 — the deployed node layout (the arity-3 chip absorb `[FACT_MARK, l, r]`).

`cap_root.rs::cap_node` folds each internal node as `cap_chip_absorb(&[CAP_FACT_MARK, l, r])` — the
arity-3 (rate-4 regime) single chip absorb. `FACT_MARK = 0xFACF` rides RATE lane 0 (a genuine rate
input, NOT a capacity tag), `l` lane 1, `r` lane 2, the length tag `3` in lane 4. So
`nodeOf l r = chipAbsorb [FACT_MARK, l, r]`, one permutation call over the length-3 block. -/

The deployed cap tree commits ONE hash everywhere — `cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb`, the IR-v2 chip's
single rate-8 absorb. Both the leaf (arity 7) and the node (arity 3) ride this one permutation call.
We bundle exactly that carrier. -/

/-- **`CapHashScheme State`** — the deployed cap-tree's SINGLE Poseidon2 carrier: the chip absorb
`chipAbsorb : List ℤ → ℤ` (`cap_root.rs::cap_chip_absorb` = the IR-v2 chip's `squeeze ∘ perm ∘
(state from arity+inputs)`), collision-resistant per row (`Compress1CR`, primitive #4 — equal output
forces equal input list, which is exactly the chip's per-row `(arity, padded inputs)` injectivity).
The `State` parameter is vestigial (the carrier is the per-row compression); the deployment instance
is the real BabyBear width-16 permutation. `nodeOf`/`capLeafDigest` are defined over it. -/

/-! ## §3 — the re-grounded primitives (`capLeafDigest`/`nodeOf` BOTH ride `chipAbsorb`). -/

/-- **`capLeafDigest S l`** — the 7-field deployed leaf digest, the SINGLE rate-8 chip absorb over the
7 leaf fields in canonical order. BYTE-IDENTICAL to `cap_root.rs::CapLeaf::digest`
(`cap_chip_absorb(&[slot_hash, target, auth_tag, mask_lo, mask_hi, expiry, breadstuff])` — ONE
permute, lanes 0..6 the genuine fields, no length tag, the chip's `big` row). -/
def capLeafDigest (l : CapLeaf) : ℤ := S.chipAbsorb (leafFields l)

/-- **`nodeOf S l r`** — the internal node hash, the arity-3 chip absorb over `packNode l r =
[FACT_MARK, l, r]`. BYTE-IDENTICAL to `cap_root.rs::cap_node` (`cap_chip_absorb(&[CAP_FACT_MARK, l,
r])` — ONE permute, `FACT_MARK` at rate lane 0). The SAME `chipAbsorb` carrier as the leaf — one cap
hash everywhere. -/
def nodeOf (l r : ℤ) : ℤ := S.chipAbsorb (packNode l r)

/-! ## §4 — injectivity (over the single chip-absorb carrier). -/

/-! ## §5 — the membership opening (the depth-16 binary-Merkle recompose up a sibling path).

A membership witness is a list of `(sibling, direction)` steps (`cap_root.rs::prove_membership`
returns exactly `(siblings, directions)`; `directions[i] = 0` ⇔ the current node is the LEFT child
at level `i`). Recomposing folds `nodeOf` up the path, mixing `(cur, sib)` by the direction bit —
LITERALLY the `descriptor_ir2` MapOps AIR's `mix` closure (`descriptor_ir2.rs:2109`):
`left = (1-dir)·cur + dir·sib`, `right = (1-dir)·sib + dir·cur`. -/

/-- One Merkle path step: the sibling digest at this level + the direction bit. -/
structure Step where
  /-- The sibling digest at this level (`cap_root.rs` `siblings[level]`). -/

  /-- The direction bit: `0` ⇒ `cur` is the LEFT child (sibling right), `1` ⇒ right child. -/
  dir : Bool
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- **`recomposeUp S cur path`** — fold the held digest up the sibling/direction path to the root. At
each level, if `dir = false` (LEFT child) the node is `nodeOf cur sib`, else `nodeOf sib cur`. This is
the exact `attenuation_witness` / MapOps-AIR fold (`cap_root.rs:425-431`, `descriptor_ir2.rs:2116`),
now over the deployed capacity-tagged `nodeOf`. -/
def recomposeUp (cur : ℤ) : List Step → ℤ
  | [] => cur
  | s :: rest =>
    recomposeUp (if s.dir then nodeOf S s.sib cur else nodeOf S cur s.sib) rest

/-- **`MembersAt S root leaf`** — the deployed-tree membership statement: there is a sibling/direction
path recomposing `root` from the 7-field leaf's digest. The witness is the path
(`cap_root.rs::prove_membership`); the relation hides it behind the existential, exactly as the
in-circuit opening realizes it. The HONEST replacement for `Substrate.Heap`'s flat-sponge `opensTo` —
the REAL rate-4 leaf digest and the REAL capacity-tagged `hash_fact` binary fold. -/

/-- **The 1-felt recompose IS the generic recompose at `D := ℤ`, `node := nodeOf S`.** Definitional

/-! ## §6 — the FAITHFUL commitment relation + the authority bridge against THIS tree.

The replacement for `CapRootBridge.CapsEncodes` (which is over `Substrate.Heap`). `DeployedEncodes`
says `cap_root` is the deployed `CanonicalCapTree`-root of a leaf set that FAITHFULLY realizes the
kernel `caps`: a write-rights membership opening of an authority-edge leaf witnesses a real held
endpoint cap. We carry the faithfulness as the runtime-encoding contract, exactly the
`compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` discipline. -/

/-! ### §6.0 — the FAITHFUL two-axis leaf decode (THE CUTOVER, FacetAuthority §10(C)).

The deployed leaf commits the authority on TWO axes, both in the 7-field leaf (`cap_root.rs:41-51`):
a FACET (`mask_lo`/`mask_hi`, two 16-bit limbs of one `EffectMask` u32) and a TIER (`auth_tag`, the
`AuthRequired` byte None=0…Custom=5). The cutover decodes BOTH off the leaf and gates the turn on
`authorizedFacetB` — NOT the toy `mask_lo == write-mask` shadow. -/

/-- **`maskOfLimbs lo hi`** — recombine the deployed split mask `(mask_lo, mask_hi)` into the one
`EffectMask` `u32`: `mask = mask_lo + mask_hi · 2^16` (`cap_root.rs::split_effect_mask`: `lo = mask &
0xFFFF`, `hi = (mask >> 16) & 0xFFFF`). The leaf-faithful inverse of the deployed limb split. -/
def maskOfLimbs (lo hi : ℤ) : ℤ := lo + hi * 65536

/-- **`tierOfTag tag`** — decode the deployed `auth_tag` BYTE to an `AuthTier` (`cap_root.rs:46`:
None=0…Custom=5; `AuthTier.tierByte` is the forward map). The IPC tiers (None…Impossible) decode by
the discriminant byte; tag `5` decodes to a `Custom` whose `vkHash` is the residual felt-absorb
(carried as `vkOfTag`, the one named crypto residual — transfers never use `Custom`, see §10). -/

  | 1 => .signature

/-- **`facetOfLeaf l`** — the leaf's decoded `Option EffectMask` facet: `some (maskOfLimbs mask_lo
mask_hi)` (the deployed `allowed_effects`; here always `some` — the leaf commits a concrete mask). -/
def facetOfLeaf (l : CapLeaf) : Option EffectMask := some (maskOfLimbs l.mask_lo l.mask_hi).toNat

/-- **`confersTransferLeaf vkOfTag provided l`** — THE FAITHFUL two-axis leaf gate (replaces the toy
`confersWriteLeaf`). The leaf confers TRANSFER authority iff (1) its decoded FACET permits the
`EFFECT_TRANSFER` bit (`isEffectPermitted`, `facet.rs:123`) AND (2) its decoded TIER (`tierOfTag
auth_tag`) is satisfied by the auth the turn `provided` (`AuthTier.isSatisfiedBy`, `permissions.rs:33`).
This is the deployed `(allowed_effects, permissions)` authority core, decoded off the committed leaf. -/

(`facetOfLeaf`, the genuine `maskOfLimbs mask_lo mask_hi`) permits `effectBit` AND (2) its decoded

/-! ### §6.G — the EFFECT-GENERAL faithfulness + bridge (residual (a): the facet axis over the turn's
ACTUAL effect, not the constant `EFFECT_TRANSFER`).

`DeployedFaithful`/`deployedCapOpen_implies_authorizedB` above pin the facet to `EFFECT_TRANSFER`, so
they only ever authorize transfer-facet caps. `DeployedFaithfulEff` carries the turn's ACTUAL
effect-kind bit `effectBit` and backs a `confersLeaf … effectBit` opening with a held cap whose facet

/-! ### §6.D — DISCHARGE: `DeployedFaithful*` is a CONSTRUCTION consequence, not a carried field.

`DeployedFaithful`/`DeployedFaithfulEff` carry a `backed` hypothesis: a conferring member opening at an
`(actor ⇒ src)` edge is backed by a REAL held `FacetCap`. The apex (`RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.
TransferAuthoritySource.hfaith`) consumes this as an ASSUMED structure field over a FREE `leafAt`. That
is the soundness analog of the ledger's faithfulness — and the ledger does NOT assume it: it BUILDS the
commitment from the kernel (`recStateCommit k` is a function OF `k`) and recovers `k` by CR injectivity
(`recStateCommit_binds_kernel`). The cap-tree side was MISSING that canonical builder, so `leafAt` floated
free and `backed` had to be carried.

This section supplies the missing builder. `canonicalLeafAt caps` is the leaf function the cap-tree
COMMITS — the deployed `compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` discipline (the cell builds its cap-tree
FROM its c-list, leaf-per-held-cap). For THAT canonical `leafAt`, `backed` is no longer a hypothesis: a
conferring leaf EXISTS only when it was built from a held conferring cap, so the witness is read off the
construction. `deployedFaithfulEff_canonical` discharges `DeployedFaithfulEff … (canonicalLeafAt caps)`
UNCONDITIONALLY (for ANY root — the faithfulness is structural in the encoding, the root binding is the
SEPARATE membership leg already discharged from CR by `capOpen_membership`). The carried `hfaith` field is
thereby reduced to "the prover opens against the CANONICAL leaf function" (the `hedge` identification the
source already carries), not an independent semantic contract over a free `leafAt`. -/

/-! ## §5b — the NATIVE 8-FELT cap tree (Phase H-CAP-8): the `node8` arity-16 chip compression.

The deployed `cap_root.rs` cap tree is now 8-FELT (`CAP_DIGEST_W = 8`): a leaf/node/root is a
length-8 vector. `CapLeaf::digest = chip_absorb_all_lanes(7, leafFields)` (8 squeezed lanes) and
`cap_node8 = chip_absorb_all_lanes(16, L8 ‖ R8)` (the arity-16 `node8` compression). The per-node
collision floor is the FULL 8-felt width (~124-bit), matching the deployed FRI/STARK soundness — vs
the lossy 1-felt `nodeOf` (kept above for the out-of-scope DSL AIR).

THE MIGRATION IS A RE-INSTANTIATION: the membership anti-ghost rides the SAME
`CapMerkleGeneric.recomposeG_inj_of_path` the 1-felt tree now delegates to — there is NO spine
re-proof. The ONLY new obligation is `nodeOf8_injective` (the arity-16 chip's collision-resistance),
discharged from the named `Compress8CR` floor exactly as `nodeOf_injective` rides `Compress1CR`. -/

/-- The 8-felt cap-tree digest carrier (`cap_root.rs::CAP_DIGEST_W = 8`): a leaf / node / root is a
length-8 felt vector (`[BabyBear; 8]`), modeled as `Fin 8 → ℤ`. -/
abbrev Digest8 := Fin 8 → ℤ

/-- ⚠ **NOT A FLOOR — FALSE AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS. It is no longer a field of anything in this file.**

`Compress8CR f` says the 8-output chip absorb `f : List ℤ → Digest8`
(`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes`, all 8 squeezed lanes) is INJECTIVE: equal 8-felt output
vectors force equal input lists. `VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear` proves this FALSE for
the deployed chip — it compresses the infinite `List ℤ` into 8 BOUNDED BabyBear lanes, so collisions
EXIST by pigeonhole.

⚑ **IT USED TO BE THE `Cap8Scheme.chip8CR` FIELD, and that made `Cap8Scheme` UNINHABITABLE**: not
merely a hypothesis on a theorem but a non-constructible field, so EVERY theorem of the form
`∀ S8 : Cap8Scheme, …` — the whole cap-family surface — was VACUOUS. The field is DELETED (§5b below);
`Cap8Scheme` now carries the chip and nothing false about it, and §5b.D exhibits a real deployed
inhabitant. The old "non-vacuity" argument (`Reference8` exhibits an injective chip, `badChip8_not_CR`
falsifies a colliding one) was exactly the FALSE COMFORT `HashFloorHonesty`'s header named: **toy
witness satisfiable, real compressing Poseidon2 false.**

**WHAT IT IS RETAINED FOR — two honest jobs, neither of them a deployed keystone:**
  1. the INJECTIVE SPECIAL CASE in the strength-relation bridges (`…_of_injective` in §5b), which show
     the deleted theorems fall straight out of the new disjunctions once you assume it — so nothing
     genuinely proved was given up by the deletion; and
  2. the refutability canaries (`coll8_refutable_of_injective`), which show the collision disjunct is
     not a free pass.
⚑ **AND THE CLASS IS NOW CLOSED (2026-07-20).** The sibling `DeployedHeapTree.Heap8Scheme` and
`DeployedFieldsTree.Fields8Scheme` carried the IDENTICAL field; both are deleted, both structures have
constructed deployed inhabitants (`deployedHeap8Scheme` / `deployedFields8Scheme`), and
`VacuitySweepTeeth` §1‴-HF fires the refutation tooth at each. `Compress8CR` is a field of NOTHING.

**RE-GROUNDED (probabilistic residual):** `Circuit.InjectiveFloorRegrounded` §1 — `Chip8Keyed` is the
deployed chip carrying no CR field, and `node8_injective_advantage_bound` /
`leaf8_injective_advantage_bound` bound the probability that an adversary in a named class `Eff`
produces the collision disjunct, with the `Eff` obligation in the open. -/

/-- **`Coll8 f p`** — the pair of input lists `p` is a GENUINE collision of the 8-output chip absorb:
two DISTINCT lists with the SAME 8-felt image.

Note what this is NOT: it is not `∃ a b, f a = f b ∧ a ≠ b`. At deployed parameters that existence
claim is UNCONDITIONALLY TRUE by pigeonhole (`compress8CR_false_babyBear` proves precisely it), so a
disjunct of that shape would be a free pass carrying no more content than `True`. `Coll8` is a
predicate about the SPECIFIC pair an extractor RETURNS, so a theorem concluding it EXHIBITS the
collision rather than asserting one exists — and it is REFUTABLE (`coll8_refutable_of_injective`). -/

(`nodeOf8`, arity 16) ride it; the input lists are length-disjoint (7 vs 16), so the chip's per-row
`(arity, padded inputs)` seeding separates the two domains for free.

⚑ **ONE FIELD, AND IT IS INHABITED.** The `chip8CR : Compress8CR chipAbsorb8` field is GONE. It
asserted injectivity of a map that squeezes an infinite domain into 8 bounded BabyBear lanes, which the
deployed chip refutes — so no deployed `Cap8Scheme` value could be constructed and every theorem
quantifying over this type was vacuous. §5b.D constructs `deployedCap8Scheme`, a real value whose chip
is deployed-shaped (BabyBear-bounded lanes) and whose own chip therefore REFUTES the deleted field
(`VacuitySweepTeeth.deployedCap8Scheme_chip_not_Compress8CR`). The collision resistance the tree used

The three theorems this section replaces — `capLeafDigest8_injective`, `nodeOf8_injective`,
`recomposeUp8_inj_of_path` — were all discharged from the `chip8CR` FIELD, i.e. from
`Compress8CR chipAbsorb8`, which the deployed chip refutes. They are DELETED, not kept beside the new
forms: keeping them is what made the earlier regrounding additive and therefore inert.

Each is replaced by a TOTAL EXTRACTOR plus a theorem that what it returns is a genuine collision. The
conclusions are disjunctions `binding ∨ Coll8 chipAbsorb8 (the pair the extractor returned)`. As
FORMULAS they are weaker than the equalities they replace; as CONTENT AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS they are
strictly stronger, because the deleted premise is unsatisfiable by the real chip — the old theorems
said nothing about the deployed system, and these hold OF it. §5b.S proves that relation in both
directions. -/

/-! ### §5b.S — THE STRENGTH RELATION, both directions (no strength was lost; no free pass was gained).

Deleting a carrier and restating its consumers as disjunctions invites two fair objections. Both are
answered here in Lean rather than in prose.

1. *"You weakened the theorems to make the deletion easy."* — the `…_of_injective` bridges assume
   exactly the injectivity the deleted field asserted, and the deleted theorems fall straight out. They
   are precisely the injective special case of the new ones.
2. *"The right disjunct is a free pass, so the disjunction says nothing."* — `coll8_refutable_of_injective`
   shows the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE: at an injective chip the extracted pair is NOT a
   collision, so the binding half has to do the work.

These are STANDALONE bridges, deliberately NOT hypotheses on any deployed keystone: `Compress8CR` is
FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, so a keystone carrying it would be right back where this repair
started. -/

/-! ### §5b.D — ⚑ THE ACCEPTANCE TEST: a REAL DEPLOYED `Cap8Scheme` VALUE.

The whole point of deleting the `chip8CR` field is measured HERE, not by a green build. With the field
present, `Cap8Scheme` had no deployed inhabitant (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear` refutes
the field for any function that lands in bounded BabyBear lanes, which the deployed chip does), so every
`∀ S8 : Cap8Scheme, …` theorem — the entire cap-family surface — was vacuously true.

`deployedCap8Scheme` below is a VALUE. Its chip is DEPLOYED-SHAPED in the only respect this argument
ever turned on: it squeezes an arbitrary-length `List ℤ` into eight lanes each reduced into `[0, p)` for
the deployed BabyBear prime, exactly like `descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes`. Nothing about a real
Poseidon2 round schedule is relevant to inhabitation — and, decisively, its own chip REFUTES the deleted
field (`VacuitySweepTeeth.deployedCap8Scheme_chip_not_Compress8CR`, which is where `compress8CR_false_babyBear`
is available). That is the tightest possible statement of what changed: **the very function the teeth
refute now INHABITS the structure.**

⚑ Honest scope: this is not a KAT-faithful Poseidon2 model (none exists in Lean here), so it is not a
byte-differential against the Rust chip. It is a deployed-SHAPED inhabitant, and shape is precisely what
the vacuity argument was about. -/
