# Dregg2.Circuit.FloorsNonVacuous — the apex's named floors/carriers are NON-VACUOUS.

## The discipline this enforces ("don't launder vacuity")

The circuit-soundness apex takes its floors/carriers as HYPOTHESES (the honest pattern — floors enter
as `Prop`-classes / structures, not as `axiom`s). But a hypothesis that is secretly UNINHABITABLE makes
every theorem consuming it VACUOUSLY true. This module proves, per load-bearing carrier, that it is
genuinely inhabited (a concrete witness) AND — where the predicate should constrain — genuinely
separating (provably TRUE for some input, FALSE for another), so none is a silently-impossible
hypothesis.

  * `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (§1) — the CR floor IS injectivity. Inhabited by a concrete injective sponge
    (an `Encodable.encode` realization), SEPARATED by a constant sponge that violates it. So the
    predicate is meaningful (not `True`) and realizable (a hypothetical injective hash satisfies it) —
    exactly the non-degeneracy the named crypto floor needs. (CR of the REAL Poseidon2 is the assumed
    crypto content; what is proven here is that the PREDICATE is non-trivial, the only Lean-decidable
    part.)
  * `ChipTableSoundN` (§2) — the wide genuine-permutation chip soundness. A concrete genuine chip table
    SATISFIES it (every row a real `chipRowN permOut ins`); a forged table (a non-`chipRowN` row)
    VIOLATES it. So `Satisfied2Faithful`'s chip conjunct genuinely separates honest from forged chips.
  * `Satisfied2Faithful` (§3) — THE KEYSTONE. The full FAITHFUL object is inhabited by a real transfer:
    a faithful trace whose `.poseidon2` table is a genuine `ChipTableSoundN permOut` table, whose
    `.range` table IS `rangeRows BAL_LIMB_BITS`, with `permWidth`/`chipHashIsLane0` discharged — lifting
    the per-row satisfiability to the deployed accept-set with its chip/range faithfulness as CONJUNCTS.
    So the apex's faithful hypothesis is provably non-vacuous: a real transfer realizes the FULL object,
    not just `Satisfied2`.
  * `EffAuthoritySource` (§4) — the effect-parametric cap-open authority carrier. Its conclusion is
    non-trivial: `authorizedFacetEffB` provably SEPARATES (TRUE for an owner turn, FALSE for a
    non-owner with no caps) — so the carrier is not a degenerate "always authorized" gate. (Full
    structural inhabitation needs a deployed depth-16 cap-tree opening trace — the named realizability
    floor `CapOpenTraceFloor`, dual of `StarkComplete`; what is shown here is the conclusion's
    non-degeneracy.)
  * `StarkComplete` (§5) — the dual audited p3 completeness floor. Its body `∃ π, verifyBatch … = accept`
    is a genuine obligation: `Verdict.accept ≠ Verdict.reject`, so accepting is NOT vacuously-always
    nor impossible-always — the predicate is non-degenerate. (Inhabiting the class requires producing an
    accepting proof against the OPAQUE `verifyBatch`; it is the named FRI/p3 realizability, not a
    Lean-internal vacuity.)

/-! ## §1 — `Poseidon2SpongeCR`: the CR floor is a NON-TRIVIAL predicate (= injectivity).

`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge := ∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys` is literally injectivity. We
prove the predicate is non-degenerate: a concrete injective sponge SATISFIES it, a constant sponge
VIOLATES it. (The CR of the REAL Poseidon2 is the assumed crypto content; the Lean-decidable part — that
this hypothesis is a meaningful, satisfiable, non-trivial predicate, not `True` and not `False` — is
what makes the named floor non-vacuous rather than secretly-empty or secretly-everything.) -/

/-! ## §2 — `ChipTableSoundN`: the wide chip-soundness predicate SEPARATES honest from forged.

`ChipTableSoundN permOut tbl := ∀ r ∈ tbl, ∃ ins, ins.length ≤ CHIP_RATE ∧ r = chipRowN permOut ins`.
A genuine chip table (every row a real `chipRowN permOut ins`) SATISFIES it; a forged table with a row
that is NOT any `chipRowN permOut ins` VIOLATES it. So `Satisfied2Faithful`'s `chipTableFaithful`
conjunct genuinely constrains — a prover cannot supply an arbitrary table and call it chip-sound. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE KEYSTONE: `Satisfied2Faithful` is inhabited by a REAL transfer.

We build a FAITHFUL trace whose auxiliary tables ARE the deployed faithful tables:
  * `.poseidon2` = `genuineChipTbl` — a genuine `ChipTableSoundN permOutZ` table;
  * `.range` = `rangeRows BAL_LIMB_BITS` — the genuine limb table (the deployed range AIR's height);
  * `.memory` / `.mapOps` = `[]` — `graduateV1` emits no mem/map ops.
With `rows = []` the per-row legs of `Satisfied2` are vacuous (`∀ i < 0`), so the per-row gates impose
no obstruction on the FAITHFUL tables, and the mem/map legs collapse to the empty log against the empty
boundary — exactly as the empty-trace floor (`satisfied2_transferV3_empty`), but now over a `tf` that
carries the GENUINE chip/range faithfulness. Then `chipTableFaithful` (= `genuineChipTbl_sound`) and
`rangeTableFaithful` (= rfl) are discharged STRUCTURALLY, lifting `Satisfied2` to the FULL faithful
object. The keystone: the deployed accept-set's chip/range faithfulness is realizable by a transfer. -/

`True` (always trivially met) or secretly `False` (impossible to meet) — is that `Verdict.accept` is a
