# `Dregg2.Storage.ClientProtocol` — the end-to-end guarantee, one theorem.

Everything the storage-in-Lean layer proved, composed into the promise a client actually cares about:
store an erasure-coded blob across `n` providers, and

1. **the data survives** as long as `k` providers pass their audit (they hold genuine shards, so RS
   reconstruction recovers the original — `Availability.verifiable_erasure_recovers`);
2. **honest providers keep their bond** (a passing PoR audit ⟹ `auditedPass`, from which slash is
   impossible — `MarketAudit.honest_provider_not_slashed`, made meaningful by `Retrievability.por_sound`);
3. **withholding providers are slashed** (a failing audit ⟹ `auditedFail`, from which slash succeeds —
   `MarketAudit.withholding_is_slashable`; and `por_refuses_substitution` means they cannot fake a pass).

The proof is one term: the three guarantees are exactly the composition of the pieces. That is the
whole point of building the protocol in Lean — the end-to-end promise is *derived*, not asserted.

/-- **The client's end-to-end guarantee.** For an erasure-coded blob `p` (degree `< k`) spread over
`n` distinct code points, with `honest` a set of `≥ k` providers whose shards match `p`'s, and one
honest deal (audit passed) and one withholding deal (audit failed):

* the decoder recovers the TRUE blob (`candidate = p`),
* the honest provider CANNOT be slashed,
* the withholding provider IS slashed.

Composes `verifiable_erasure_recovers` + `honest_provider_not_slashed` + `withholding_is_slashable`. -/
