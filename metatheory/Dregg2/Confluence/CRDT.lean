# Dregg2.Confluence.CRDT — the CRDT instance catalog for the third judgement.

`Dregg2.Confluence` declares the *abstract* third judgement: a cell's mergeable
state is a `MergeState` (a join-semilattice), and an invariant `I` is `IConfluent`
iff `∀ x y, I x → I y → I (x ⊔ y)` — the BEC Thm 3.1 tier-1 (coordination-free)
eligibility test. It exhibits the property is non-vacuous (`top_iconfluent` /
`cardLeOne_not_iconfluent` over `Finset ℕ`) but only over that one toy lattice.

THIS module is the *catalog*: the standard CRDTs each realized as a concrete
`MergeState`, with their keystone invariants classified — which run tier-1
(coordination-free, partition-tolerant) and which are FORCED to escalate
(`nonpairwise_escalation`). Everything is derived from mathlib's order-theory
(the three CRDT merge laws — `sup_assoc` / `sup_comm` / `sup_idem` — come FREE
from `SemilatticeSup`; `sup_le_sup` gives monotone-invariant closure; `Pi` /
`Prod` / `Finset` semilattices give the structural lifts), so this module adds NO
new dependency.

The catalog (each is a `MergeState` instance + a classified keystone invariant):
  1. `GCounter ι` (= `ι → ℕ`, Pi ∘ ℕ-max) — grow-only lower bound IS I-confluent.
  2. `PNCounter ι` (= `GCounter ι × GCounter ι`, Prod) — net = inc.sum − dec.sum,
     a NON-monotone observable off monotone components (the tier-2 lift).
  3. `GSet α` (= `Finset α`) — membership-monotone IS I-confluent (generalizes the
     `Finset ℕ` witness of `Confluence.lean`).
  4. `ORSet α τ` (= adds `Finset (α×τ)` × removes `Finset (α×τ)`) — the add-wins
     `present` lookup invariant IS I-confluent (a real lift over the tombstone Prod).
  5. `LWW T V` (last-writer-wins register) — merge = max-by-timestamp, with the
     tie / total-order obligation discharged EXPLICITLY (a genuine SemilatticeSup
     proof, not glossed: `merge` must be assoc/comm/idem and that needs the LinearOrder).
  6. `BoundedCounter` / ESCROW — the DELIBERATELY non-I-confluent case: the global
     `value ≤ B` is NOT I-confluent (escalation forced, exhibited via
     `nonpairwise_escalation`). THEN the positive ESCROW REFINEMENT: a quota
     partition (Σ per-replica reserved quota = B) makes each LOCAL decrement
     invariant-preserving — the Balegas/Sypytkowski bounded-counter, the bridge to
     dregg's escrow holding-store. This is the substantive proof, not a free compose.

Reuse combinators (written once): `ProductMergeState` /
`product_iconfluent`, `MapMergeState` / `map_iconfluent` (the pointwise lift), and
an HONEST note on the n-ary lift (pairwise I-confluence does NOT auto-give n-ary
safety — the "three pairwise-fine spends jointly overspend" gap `Confluence.lean`
flags; the grow-only n-ary lift IS provable and is proved, the bounded case is not).

/-! ## §0. Reuse combinators — used by the catalog below.

`MergeState` already `extends SemilatticeSup`, and mathlib gives `SemilatticeSup`
for `Prod` and `Pi`. The structural `MergeState` instances are one-liners; the
I-confluence lift is named so the catalog can reuse it. -/

/-- **Product merge-state.** `A × B` is a `MergeState` when both factors are
(componentwise join, `Prod.instSemilatticeSup`). -/

  toSemilatticeSup := inferInstance

/-- **The product I-confluence lift.** If `I_A` is I-confluent over `A` and `I_B`
over `B`, the conjunctive invariant `fun p => I_A p.1 ∧ I_B p.2` is I-confluent
over `A × B`. Merge is componentwise, so each conjunct closes independently. -/
theorem product_iconfluent {A : Type u} {B : Type v}

  exact ⟨hA x.1 y.1 hx.1 hy.1, hB x.2 y.2 hx.2 hy.2⟩

/-- **Map / function-space merge-state.** `K → V` is a `MergeState` when `V` is
(pointwise join, `Pi.instSemilatticeSup`). This is the substrate for `GCounter`. -/

  toSemilatticeSup := inferInstance

/-- **The pointwise I-confluence lift.** If for *every* key `k` the per-key
invariant `J k` is I-confluent over `V`, then the conjunction-over-keys
`fun f => ∀ k, J k (f k)` is I-confluent over `K → V`. Merge is pointwise
(`Pi.sup_apply : (f ⊔ g) k = f k ⊔ g k`), so each key closes independently. -/

/-! ## §1. G-Counter — grow-only counter `ι → ℕ`.

`ℕ` is a `LinearOrder`, hence (via `LinearOrder.toLattice`) a `SemilatticeSup`
with `⊔ = max`; the Pi-instance lifts it to `ι → ℕ`. The CRDT merge of two
G-counter replicas is the per-key max — exactly `⊔`. -/

abbrev GCounter (ι : Type u) := ι → ℕ

instance instMergeStateGCounter (ι : Type u) : MergeState (GCounter ι) :=
  inferInstanceAs (MergeState (ι → ℕ))

/-- **The G-counter merge is the per-key max.** (`⊔` on `ℕ` is `max`; the Pi sup is

/-- **The keystone: a grow-only lower bound is I-confluent.** The invariant "replica
`i` has counted at least `k`" survives merge, because merge only ever raises counts
(`le_sup_left`). A grow-only counter's "≥ k" invariant runs tier-1
(coordination-free, partition-tolerant). -/
theorem gcounter_lowerBound_iconfluent {ι : Type u} (i : ι) (k : ℕ) :
    IConfluent (S := GCounter ι) (fun f => k ≤ f i) := by

theorem gcounter_bot_apply {ι : Type u} (k : ι) : (⊥ : GCounter ι) k = 0 := rfl

/-! ## §2. PN-Counter — positive/negative counter = `GCounter × GCounter`.

A PN-counter is two G-counters: `inc` (increments) and `dec` (decrements). The
merge is the product merge (`ProductMergeState`), i.e. componentwise per-key max.
The *observable* `value = (Σ inc) − (Σ dec)` is NOT monotone (decrements can lower
it), yet it is a well-defined functional of monotone components — this is the
"tier-2 lift" the catalog flags: a non-monotone net read sitting on a confluent
merge. We fix a `Fintype` index so the sums are well-defined. -/

/-- A PN-counter over a finite index: `(inc, dec)`, each a `GCounter`. -/
abbrev PNCounter (ι : Type u) := GCounter ι × GCounter ι

  inferInstanceAs (MergeState (GCounter ι × GCounter ι))

/-- The PN-counter observable value `(Σ inc) − (Σ dec) : ℤ` over a finite index. -/
def pnValue {ι : Type u} [Fintype ι] (p : PNCounter ι) : ℤ :=
  (∑ k, (p.1 k : ℤ)) - (∑ k, (p.2 k : ℤ))

/-- **The tier-2 lift, positive direction: a grow-only invariant on the `inc` half
is I-confluent**, even though the PN value itself is non-monotone. "The increment-
side total for replica `i` is ≥ k" survives merge — `gcounter_lowerBound_iconfluent`
lifted through the product. A PN counter runs tier-1 for invariants on its monotone
components; only the coupled `value`-bound (§6) forces escalation. -/

/-! ## §3. G-Set — grow-only set `Finset α`.

Generalizes the `Finset ℕ` instance of `Confluence.lean` to an arbitrary
`DecidableEq` element type. Merge is union (`Finset` ⊔ = ∪). The
membership-monotone invariant "`a` is present" survives merge (union only adds). -/

/-! ## §4. OR-Set — observed-remove set, add-wins.

Modeled as an add-set `A` and a remove-set (tombstones) `R`, each a set of
`(element × tag)` pairs (the tags are unique per add — the "observed" payload).
Merge is the product merge: union of adds, union of removes. The add-wins lookup is
"`(a, t)` is *present* iff it was added and that exact tagged add was not removed".
We prove the **per-pair presence** invariant I-confluent — the standard OR-set
add-wins read survives concurrent merge. -/

/-- An OR-set over elements `α` with tags `τ`: `(adds, removes)`. -/
abbrev ORSet (α : Type u) (τ : Type v) [DecidableEq α] [DecidableEq τ] :=

/-- **The keystone: "added-and-not-removed" is I-confluent for a tag-fixed lookup.**
For a specific tagged add `(a, t)`, the add-wins invariant "`(a,t)` is present"
survives merge: the add half only grows (`le_sup_left`), and both replicas having
not tombstoned `(a,t)` together imply non-membership in the merged removes
(`o₁.2 ∪ o₂.2`). This is not a free product compose — the `removes` side is
anti-monotone for the read, so the `∉ (R₁ ∪ R₂)` obligation is discharged by hand. -/

/-! ## §5. LWW-Register — last-writer-wins register, merge = max-by-timestamp.

A register carrying `(ts, val)` with `ts` in a `LinearOrder`. Merge keeps the entry
with the larger timestamp; on a tie we keep the lexicographically-larger payload so
merge is well-defined (commutative + idempotent) WITHOUT assuming distinct
timestamps — the tie obligation the spec demands be handled explicitly rather than
glossed. We build the `SemilatticeSup` by hand (this is a REAL proof: `sup` must be
commutative, associative, idempotent, and the `≤`/`sup` laws must agree). -/

/-! ## §6. Bounded-Counter / ESCROW — the non-I-confluent case + the refinement.

This is the substantive section. A bounded counter must keep a GLOBAL total
`value ≤ B`. We FIRST show that bound is NOT I-confluent (so a naive replicated
bounded counter is forced to escalate to consensus), exhibiting a real clashing
pair via `nonpairwise_escalation`. We THEN give the Balegas/Sypytkowski ESCROW
REFINEMENT: partition the budget `B` into per-replica quotas whose sum is `B`; each
replica may decrement only against its OWN quota; this LOCAL discipline preserves
the global bound WITHOUT coordination — the bridge to dregg's escrow holding-store.

### §6a. The bounded total is NOT I-confluent (escalation forced).

We model the per-replica "consumed against budget" as a `GCounter (Fin 2)` (two
replicas). The global value consumed is the sum of the two replicas' consumption.
The invariant "total consumed ≤ B" is what an escrow must keep. Two replicas can
EACH be within budget yet their merge (= per-key max) overshoots — the classic
"two concurrent spends that each fit, but not together". -/

/-- Per-replica consumption against a shared budget, over two replicas. Merge is the
per-key max (the G-counter merge). -/
abbrev Budget := GCounter (Fin 2)

/-- Global consumed = replica-0 consumption + replica-1 consumption. -/
def consumed (b : Budget) : ℕ := b 0 + b 1

/-- The bounded invariant: total consumption is within budget `B`. -/
def withinBudget (B : ℕ) (b : Budget) : Prop := consumed b ≤ B

/-- **The bounded total is NOT I-confluent.** With `B = 1`, states `x = (1,0)` and
`y = (0,1)` each satisfy `consumed ≤ 1`, but their merge `(1,1)` has `consumed = 2 > 1`.
A bounded counter cannot run tier-1; it must escalate to tier-2 / consensus. -/
theorem withinBudget_not_iconfluent :
    ¬ IConfluent (S := Budget) (withinBudget 1) := by
  intro h
  -- x = (1,0), y = (0,1): both consume ≤ 1.
  let x : Budget := fun i => if i = 0 then 1 else 0
  let y : Budget := fun i => if i = 0 then 0 else 1
  have hx : withinBudget 1 x := by
    show consumed x ≤ 1; decide
  have hy : withinBudget 1 y := by
    show consumed y ≤ 1; decide

  -- merge = per-key max = (1,1): consumed = 2, violating ≤ 1.
  have hno : ¬ withinBudget 1 (x ⊔ y) := by
    show ¬ consumed (x ⊔ y) ≤ 1
    -- `consumed (x ⊔ y) = max (x 0) (y 0) + max (x 1) (y 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
    have : consumed (x ⊔ y) = 2 := by decide
    rw [this]; decide
  exact hno hbad

/-- The constructive escalation witness via `Confluence.nonpairwise_escalation`: a
clashing pair exists, so consensus is genuinely forced. -/
theorem withinBudget_escalation :
    ∃ x y : Budget, withinBudget 1 x ∧ withinBudget 1 y ∧ ¬ withinBudget 1 (x ⊔ y) :=
  nonpairwise_escalation (withinBudget 1) withinBudget_not_iconfluent

/-! ### §6b. The ESCROW REFINEMENT — quota partition restores coordination-freedom.

The Balegas/Sypytkowski insight: don't share the budget `B` globally; PARTITION it
into per-replica reserved quotas `q : Fin n → ℕ` with `Σ q = B`. Each replica may
consume only against its own quota (`b i ≤ q i`). Then:

  * the LOCAL discipline "each replica stays within its own quota" IS I-confluent
    (it is a conjunction of per-key grow-only upper bounds — but bounded! so we must
    show the merge, being a per-key max of two within-quota states, stays within
    quota: `max (x i) (y i) ≤ q i` from `x i ≤ q i` and `y i ≤ q i`); and
  * that local discipline IMPLIES the global bound (`Σ b ≤ Σ q = B`).

So the escrow cell runs tier-1 (coordination-free, partition-tolerant) WHILE keeping
the global bound — the exact bridge to dregg's escrow holding-store. THIS is the
genuine positive theorem; it is NOT a free composition (the per-key bound is an
UPPER bound, anti-monotone for grow-only merge, so the closure under `⊔` is the real
content: `sup_le`). -/

/-- The escrow's LOCAL invariant: every replica `i` stays within its reserved quota
`q i`. (Over a general index `ι`.) -/
def withinQuota {ι : Type u} (q : ι → ℕ) (b : ι → ℕ) : Prop := ∀ i, b i ≤ q i

/-- **Refinement keystone (1): the local quota discipline is I-confluent.** The
merge of two within-quota states is per-key `max`; `max (x i) (y i) ≤ q i` follows
from both operands being bounded by `q i` (`max_le`). A quota-partitioned escrow
runs tier-1. Note: an upper bound under a grow-only merge is preserved exactly
because `⊔` is the least upper bound — a common upper bound bounds the join. -/
theorem withinQuota_iconfluent {ι : Type u} (q : ι → ℕ) :
    IConfluent (S := GCounter ι) (withinQuota q) := by
  intro x y hx hy i
  -- `(x ⊔ y) i = max (x i) (y i)`; bound by `q i` since both are.
  show (x ⊔ y) i ≤ q i
  rw [gcounter_merge_apply]
  exact max_le (hx i) (hy i)

/-- **Refinement keystone (2): the local discipline implies the global bound.** If
`Σ q = B` and every replica is within its quota, then `Σ b ≤ Σ q = B`
(`Finset.sum_le_sum`). Combined with keystone (1), a partitioned escrow keeps
`value ≤ B` coordination-free. -/
theorem withinQuota_implies_global {ι : Type u} [Fintype ι]

    (∑ i, b i) ≤ B := by
  calc (∑ i, b i) ≤ (∑ i, q i) := Finset.sum_le_sum (fun i _ => hq i)
    _ = B := hsum

/-- **The escrow refinement, packaged.** A quota partition `q` with `Σ q = B` yields:
(i) the local discipline is I-confluent (tier-1 eligible), and (ii) any satisfying
state respects the global bound `≤ B`. The escrow cell is coordination-free yet
globally bound-preserving (Balegas/Sypytkowski bounded-counter). -/

/-! ### §6c. A LOCAL escrow decrement stays in-bound (the operational read).

Operationally, escrow consumption GROWS (a decrement of the available balance is an
increment of `consumed`). A local decrement by `d` against replica `i` keeps the
quota discipline iff `b i + d ≤ q i` (replica `i` had `≥ d` reserve left). We show
the post-decrement state still satisfies `withinQuota`. -/

/-- Apply a local consumption of `d` units at replica `i`. -/
def localConsume {ι : Type u} [DecidableEq ι] (b : ι → ℕ) (i : ι) (d : ℕ) : ι → ℕ :=
  fun j => if j = i then b j + d else b j

/-- **A local decrement within the replica's remaining quota stays in-bound.**
If `b` was within quota and `b i + d ≤ q i`, consuming `d` at replica `i` keeps
the state within quota — no coordination needed. -/

/-! ## §7. The n-ary lift — and the HONEST gap.

`Confluence.lean` flags that PAIRWISE I-confluence does NOT auto-give n-ary safety
("three pairwise-fine spends jointly overspend"). We are explicit about which lifts
hold and which do not.

  * **The grow-only n-ary lift HOLDS and is PROVED** (`gset_member_nary`): for a
    grow-only set, "`a` is present in the union of ANY finite family of replicas"
    follows from `a` being present in one of them, via `Finset.le_sup`
    (`Mathlib.Order.CompleteLattice.Finset`'s n-ary `Finset.sup`). Grow-only
    invariants compose to all arities because the merge is a true (least) upper
    bound and the invariant is monotone.

  * **The bounded n-ary lift FAILS** — and that failure is exactly §6a. Even
    "pairwise within budget" does not give "n-ary within budget" (`B = 2`, three
    replicas each consuming `1`: every PAIR sums to `2 ≤ 2`, but the triple sums to
    `3 > 2`). We do NOT claim it; the honest statement is the escalation of §6a/§6b,
    and the resolution is the quota partition (which IS n-ary-safe — `escrow_refinement`
    is stated over an arbitrary `Fintype ι`, i.e. any arity, precisely because the
    quota discipline is a per-replica UPPER bound that `sup_le` closes at every
    arity). So the n-ary-safe escrow is the §6b theorem, NOT a pairwise lift. -/

/-- **The grow-only n-ary lift.** If `a ∈ s` for some `s ∈ F`, then `a ∈ F.sup id`
(the n-ary `⊔`). Grow-only invariants compose to all arities. -/
theorem gset_member_nary {α : Type u} [DecidableEq α] (a : α) (F : Finset (GSet α))
    (s : GSet α) (hsF : s ∈ F) (has : a ∈ s) : a ∈ F.sup id := by
  have hle : s ≤ F.sup id := Finset.le_sup (f := id) hsF
  exact hle has

/-- **The bounded case is NOT n-ary-safe — the honest gap, proved.** With `B = 2`
and three replicas each consuming `1`, every pair is within budget but the triple is
not. This is why the quota partition (§6b), not a pairwise closure, is the correct
tier-1 escrow. -/
theorem bounded_not_nary_safe :

/-! ## §8. #eval witnesses — non-vacuity, by computation.

Computational sanity checks: the merge laws on concrete inputs, the grow-only
invariant surviving merge, the bounded clash, and an escrow local decrement. These
are not proofs — the theorems above are — but they make the catalog concretely
inspectable. -/
