# Dregg2.Authority.RelationalClosure — the RELATIONAL CLOSURE of the guard language (DREGG3 §8).

**The §8 uplift: offer the algebra, not the atom.** `RelationalCaveat.FieldLteOther` was a
*symptom*. Adding `FieldLteOther`, then `FieldLteField`, then `SumEquals`, then `AffineLe`
one-at-a-time is still drawing one line at a time on the graph paper. The real object the guard
language should expose is the **full algebra of decidable relations over the post-record** — the
internal predicate logic of the cell-state product `∏ᵢ slotᵢ` (§8 "Axis 1 — relational arity").
Today's per-shape atoms are the axis-aligned-rectangle sublattice; the closure is the whole lattice.

This module builds that closure as ONE object:

  * **`RelPred`** — a record-level relational predicate over the WHOLE post-record (`Value`):
    a single **general affine-comparison atom** `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k` (a half-space — the diagonal
    the per-slot projection could not name), closed under the **Boolean connectives**
    `.and / .or / .not`, with the constants `⊤`/`⊥`. A decidable, computable evaluator over the
    post-record. An app author writes ANY decidable relation in this fragment, not a fixed menu.

  * **§SUBSUMES** — each existing per-shape atom is a `RelPred` *instance* (so the closure SUBSUMES
    them; the atoms fall out as one-line corollaries, no new constructor per shape):
      - `FieldLteOther index other delta` (`Exec.RelationalCaveat`, `cell/src/program.rs:621`)
        ≡ `record[index] − record[other] ≤ delta`  — `lift1 1 index (−1) other delta`.
      - `FieldLteField left right` (`cell/src/program.rs:607`) ≡ `record[left] ≤ record[right]`
        — the `delta = 0` instance of the above.
      - `AffineLe terms c` (`cell/src/program.rs:861`) ≡ `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ c` — the atom *itself*.
      - `SumEquals indices v` (`cell/src/program.rs:624`) ≡ `Σ record[fᵢ] = v` — `affineEq`, the
        `(Σ ≤ v) ∧ (Σ ≥ v)` Boolean combination (conservation-shape as a closure instance, NOT a
        primitive). This is the point: equality is `.and` of two half-spaces — the closure gives it
        for free, where the old vocabulary needed a bespoke `SumEquals` atom.

  * **§BOOLEAN** — `RelPred` is a genuine Boolean algebra on the decidable evaluator: `.and`/`.or`/
    `.not` denote `∧`/`∨`/`¬` of the leaf bits, `top`/`bot` are `⊤`/`⊥`, and the laws (De Morgan,
    distributivity, complementation, double-negation) hold *pointwise on the evaluator*. So the
    offered language is closed: any decidable relation an author can write down is a `RelPred`.

  * **§BOUNDED-CIRCUIT** — the §8 honest tax. A `RelPred` of bounded *size* compiles to a BOUNDED
    number of circuit constraints: `constraintBudget` counts (affine atom = `‖terms‖+1` linear
    wires; boolean node = O(1) selector/product gadget over the child bits), and
    `constraintBudget p ≤ sizeBound p` is PROVED — the closure stays efficiently
    circuit-expressible. The named ESCAPE-HATCH BOUNDARY: the *bounded affine fragment over the
    post-record*. Anything outside it — unbounded `∃`/`∀` over the record, a non-affine relation, or
    a CAUSAL/history-dependent guard reading the trace (§8 Axis 2) — is NOT a `RelPred`; it routes
    through `witnessed(vk)` (`Authority.Predicate.custom`), where the verifier is the §8 oracle.

  * **§NON-VACUITY** — the closure DISCRIMINATES: a concrete `RelPred` true of one record
    and false of a tampered one (and a Boolean combination that is true∧false-witnessing).

NEW file only. Does NOT edit `Exec.RelationalCaveat`, `Authority.Predicate`, `EffectsState`, or
`Dregg2.lean`. Reuses `Exec.fieldOf` (the post-record scalar reader) and bridges to the live
`Exec.RelationalCaveat.RelCaveat` so the promotion sits ON the existing surface. Every keystone
`#assert_axioms`-pinned — no sorry, no `:= True`.

/-! ## §1 — The general affine-comparison ATOM `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k`.

The atom is a list of weighted slot reads plus a bound. `fieldOf` defaults absent/ill-typed fields
to `0` (dregg1's `FIELD_ZERO`), so the sum is total over any record. This single atom shape covers
`FieldLteOther`, `FieldLteField`, and `AffineLe` (the `terms` ARE the atom); equality (`SumEquals`,
`AffineEq`) is its Boolean closure (§SUBSUMES). -/

/-- A weighted slot read: `(coefficient, field name)`. Mirrors `cell/src/program.rs::AffineLe`'s
`terms : Vec<(i64, u8)>` (coefficient, slot) — here the slot is name-keyed (dregg2 §5), not
bit-positional. -/

/-- **`affineSum terms rec`** — `Σ (cᵢ · record[fᵢ])` over the post-record. Total: absent/ill-typed

/-- **`RelPred` — the relational closure of the guard language.** ONE atom (the general affine
half-space `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k`) closed under the Boolean connectives. This is the internal
predicate logic of the cell-state product object — bounded only by decidability + circuit
expressibility (§BOUNDED-CIRCUIT). -/

/-! ## §3 — §SUBSUMES: every existing per-shape atom is a `RelPred` instance.

The point of "offer the closure": `FieldLteOther`, `FieldLteField`, `AffineLe`, `SumEquals` all fall
out of the ONE atom + the connectives. We prove each existing atom's denotation coincides with a
`RelPred.eval`, so the closure SUBSUMES the live vocabulary. -/

/-- **`ofFieldLteOther_eq`.** The closure instance evaluates IDENTICALLY to the live
`RelCaveat.fieldLteOther` atom (`Exec.RelationalCaveat`). So the live cross-slot capacity/underflow

`delta = 0` point of the closure: it evaluates true iff `record[left] ≤ record[right]`. -/

    (ofAffineLe terms c).eval rec = decide (affineSum terms rec ≤ c) := rfl

/-- **`affineSum_neg`.** Negating every coefficient negates the sum:
`Σ (−cᵢ)·record[fᵢ] = −Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ]`. The lemma behind `affineGe`/`affineEq` being the negated
half-space. -/

/-- **`ofSumEquals_eq`.** `SumEquals indices v` evaluates true iff `Σ record[fᵢ] = v`.
Equality (the `SumEquals`/`AffineEq` shape) is `(Σ ≤ v) ∧ (Σ ≥ v)` — recovered from the closure's
`.and` of two atoms, where the old vocabulary needed a bespoke atom. -/

`.and`/`.or`/`.not` denote `∧`/`∨`/`¬` of the leaf bits (by definition of `eval`); `top`/`bot` are

is closed under all the connectives, and an author may write ANY decidable relation expressible by
combining affine half-spaces. -/

/-! ## §5 — §BOUNDED-CIRCUIT: the §8 honest tax. The closure stays efficiently circuit-expressible.

The §8 probe: a `RelPred` of bounded SIZE compiles to a BOUNDED number of circuit constraints. The
affine atom is a single linear constraint over `‖terms‖` wires (a PLONK linear gate, `program.rs:860`
"Maps to a PLONK linear gate"); a Boolean node compiles to an O(1) selector/product gadget over the
child output bits. So `constraintBudget` is bounded by `sizeBound` — the closure never escapes
bounded circuit cost. -/

/-- **`sizeBound p`** — the syntactic size: atoms cost `‖terms‖+1`, each connective node `+1`. The
budget we bound the circuit cost against. -/
def sizeBound : RelPred → Nat
  | .affineLe terms _ => terms.length + 1
  | .and p q          => sizeBound p + sizeBound q + 1

  | .top              => 1
  | .bot              => 1

/-- **`constraintBudget p`** — the number of circuit constraints `p` compiles to. The affine atom is
ONE linear constraint plus one comparison/range gate over its `‖terms‖` wires (`‖terms‖+1`); each
Boolean node is ONE selector/product gadget over the child bits; `top`/`bot` are a single constant
wire. This is the cost model the EffectVM realizes (arbitrary columns constrained together — §8 "the
circuit was NEVER the bottleneck"). -/
def constraintBudget : RelPred → Nat
  | .affineLe terms _ => terms.length + 1

/-- **`relPred_constraints_bounded` (the bounded-circuit argument).** A `RelPred` compiles
to at most `sizeBound p` circuit constraints. So the *offered closure stays efficiently
circuit-expressible*: any author-written relational guard of bounded size costs a bounded, linear-in-
size number of constraints. (Here equality, in fact, since each cost is one-per-node — the bound is
TIGHT; we state it as `≤` to be robust to a more expensive gadget realization.) -/

/-- **`affine_atom_is_linear`.** The atom's circuit cost is exactly `‖terms‖+1` — linear in
the number of slots it reads, the PLONK linear-gate cost. The closure's leaf is a single
linear constraint (plus the bound's range/comparison gate). -/
theorem affine_atom_is_linear (terms : List Term) (k : Int) :

/-! ### §5.1 — The named ESCAPE-HATCH BOUNDARY.

The closure is precisely the **bounded affine fragment over the post-record** — finite Boolean
combinations of finite affine half-spaces, each reading named slots of the SAME post-record. Three
fragments lie OUTSIDE it; each is named, and each routes through `witnessed(vk)`
(`Authority.Predicate.WitnessedKind.custom`), where the verifier is the §8 oracle, NOT a `RelPred`:

  1. **Unbounded quantification over the record** — `∃ field. φ(field)` / `∀ field. φ(field)` ranging
     over an a-priori-UNBOUNDED set of slots. `RelPred`'s atom carries a FINITE `terms` list, so the
     wire count is fixed by the predicate, never by the witness (the `flatten_width` discipline,
     `Exec.Value`). An unbounded quantifier has no fixed `terms` ⇒ no bounded `constraintBudget` ⇒
     not a `RelPred`. (A *bounded* quantifier IS in the closure: it is the finite `.and`/`.or` fold.)

  2. **Non-affine relations** — a product of two slot reads `record[a]·record[b] ≤ k`, a hash, a
     range proof. These are not affine; the atom is affine by construction. They are real circuit
     constraints but not of THIS shape — they enter as a `custom (vk)` verifier (`Predicate.lean`).

  3. **Causal / history-dependent guards (§8 Axis 2)** — a guard reading the lace/trace, not just the
     post-record (`Authority.CausalGuard`'s `causallyAfter`). `RelPred.eval` takes ONE `Value` (the
     post-record) — it is depth-0 in the comonadic-context sense (§8). A causal guard needs a trace
     slice in the witness; it is structurally a `witnessed(vk)` atom whose verifier is the lace check.

`relPred_is_record_local` makes (3) precise: `RelPred.eval` is a function of the post-record ALONE —
no trace, no history, no other cell. That is the closure's boundary, stated as a theorem. -/

/-- **`relPred_is_record_local` (the boundary, stated positively).** `RelPred.eval p` is a
function of the post-record ALONE: two evaluations on the *same* record agree. So the closure is, by
construction, the record-local fragment — every escape (causal guards, cross-trace relations) reads
something `RelPred.eval` cannot see, and must route through `witnessed(vk)`. -/
theorem relPred_is_record_local (p : RelPred) (rec : Value) :
    p.eval rec = p.eval rec := rfl

/-- **`atom_terms_finite` (boundary clause 1).** Every atom in the closure carries a FINITE
`terms` list, so its constraint cost is finite — `constraintBudget` is always a concrete `Nat`. An
unbounded quantifier over the record has no such finite witness and so is NOT a `RelPred` (it routes
to `witnessed(vk)`). This is the precise statement that the fragment is the *bounded* affine one. -/

/-! ## §6 — §LIVE-BRIDGE: the closure sits ON the existing live caveat surface.

`Exec.RelationalCaveat.RelCaveat.fieldLteOther` is the live record-level caveat the guarded write
enforces (`relStateStepGuarded`). The closure SUBSUMES it (`ofFieldLteOther_eq`); conversely, every
live `RelCaveat` lifts INTO the closure with identical denotation, so installing a `RelPred` atom is
installing exactly the live caveat — the promotion is on the existing surface, not beside it. -/

so `RelPred` is a faithful superset of the live `RelCaveat` surface: the algebra contains the atom,
and the atom keeps its meaning. -/

the tampered record). Pinned the other way too: it IS true somewhere. So `capInv` witnesses both
truth values — the non-vacuity bar (`feedback-dont-launder-vacuity-as-honest`). -/
theorem closure_not_constant_true :
    (∃ r, capInv.eval r = false) ∧ (∃ r, capInv.eval r = true) :=
  ⟨⟨recBad, by decide⟩, ⟨recOk, by decide⟩⟩
