# Dregg2.Authority.ArithmeticClosure — the ARITHMETIC (polynomial) closure of the guard language.

**The §8 uplift, one notch deeper: the circuit is natively QUADRATIC, so affine was still
under-shooting.** `Authority.RelationalClosure` (the prior landing) built `RelPred` = the affine
half-spaces `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k` closed under `∧/∨/¬`, subsuming
`FieldLteOther`/`FieldLteField`/`AffineLe`/`SumEquals`. That was the right *direction* — offer the
algebra, not the atom — but it self-imposed a ceiling the circuit never had. A PLONK gate is

      qL·a + qR·b + qM·a·b + qO·c + qC = 0

— natively **quadratic** (the `qM·a·b` product term). Constraining `record[a]·record[b] = record[c]`
(an AMM/conservation-product shape) is ONE multiplication gate, free structurally; the affine
fragment simply could not *name* it. So the real closure of the guard language is the **bounded-degree
POLYNOMIAL relations over the post-record** — `RelPred` was the degree-1 slice of THIS object.

This module builds the arithmetic closure as a NEW object (`RelationalClosure.lean` untouched —
its `RelPred` is imported and SUBSUMED, not edited):

  * **`ArithPred`** — a record-level predicate whose atom is a general bounded-degree polynomial
    `polyTerm` = a sum of monomials, each `coefficient · (record[f₁] · record[f₂] · …)` (a product of
    finitely many named-slot reads), compared (`≤`/`=`/`≥`) against a constant, closed under the
    Boolean connectives `∧/∨/¬` with `⊤`/`⊥`. A decidable, computable evaluator over the post-record.
    The affine atom is the special case where every monomial has at most one factor (degree ≤ 1).

  * **§SUBSUMES** — `ofRelPred` lifts every affine `RelPred` into `ArithPred` (an affine atom = a
    degree-1 polynomial; the connectives map structurally), and `ofRelPred_eval_eq` PROVES the lift
    evaluates IDENTICALLY. So the whole affine closure (and through it `FieldLteOther`/`AffineLe`/
    `SumEquals`/the live `RelCaveat`) is a *point* in the arithmetic closure — degree-1.

  * **§BOOLEAN** — `ArithPred` is a genuine Boolean algebra on the evaluator (De Morgan,
    distributivity, complementation, double-negation, identity) — proven pointwise on `eval`.

  * **§NON-AFFINE GAIN** — the discriminator that affine could not express: a multiplicative invariant
    `record[a]·record[b] = record[c]` (the constant-product / AMM-pool shape `x·y = k`). Witnessed
    true on a good record, false on a tampered one — AND argued non-affine (`mulInv` agrees
    with no affine atom: it is non-monotone in each factor, which an affine `Σ cᵢ·xᵢ ≤ k` cannot be).

  * **§BOUNDED-CIRCUIT** — a degree-d, m-monomial `ArithPred` compiles to O(monomials × degree) PLONK
    constraints: each monomial of degree d chains `d−1` multiplication gates (`qM·a·b`) to fold its
    factors, plus one linear gate to sum the monomials against the bound; Boolean nodes are O(1)
    gadgets. `arithPred_constraints_bounded` PROVES `constraintBudget p ≤ sizeBound p`, and
    `monomial_cost_is_degree` pins the per-monomial cost at its factor count. The named BOUNDARY:
    UNBOUNDED degree / UNBOUNDED monomials (a polynomial whose degree or term count is set by the
    witness, not the predicate) and non-arithmetic relations (a hash, a range proof read as
    a circuit, a causal/trace guard) — those route through `witnessed(vk)`
    (`Authority.Predicate`), the §8 oracle.

  * **§NON-VACUITY** — `mulInv` discriminates (true-on-good / false-on-tampered), as `#guard`s AND as
    proved theorems; the algebra laws hold on tampered records too.

NEW file only. Does NOT edit `RelationalClosure.lean`, `Exec.RelationalCaveat`,
`Authority.Predicate`, `EffectsState`, or `Dregg2.lean`. Reuses `Exec.fieldOf` (the post-record
scalar reader) and `RelationalClosure.RelPred` (the affine slice it subsumes). Every keystone
`#assert_axioms`-pinned — no sorry, no `:= True`.

/-! ## §1 — The polynomial ATOM: a `polyTerm` over the post-record.

A **monomial** is a coefficient times a product of finitely many named-slot reads:
`coefficient · (record[f₁] · record[f₂] · … · record[f_d])`. The product is `d` slot reads, so the
monomial's DEGREE is `factors.length`. A **`polyTerm`** is a finite list of monomials, summed. This
is the general bounded-degree polynomial over the post-record — the affine `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ]` is the
special case where every monomial has exactly one factor (degree 1). -/

/-- A **monomial** `coeff · ∏ record[fᵢ]`: a coefficient and a list of slot reads to multiply. The
empty `factors` list is a constant monomial (`coeff · 1`); a singleton is the affine term `coeff·xᵢ`;
length `d` is degree `d` — exactly `d−1` PLONK `qM·a·b` multiplication gates to evaluate (§5). -/
structure Monomial where

/-- A **`polyTerm`** = a finite list of monomials, summed. The general bounded-degree polynomial
over the post-record (the EffectVM constrains arbitrary columns of the same row together, so this is
"more polynomial constraints on the same row" — §8). -/
abbrev PolyTerm := List Monomial

/-- **`monomialEval m rec`** — `coeff · ∏ record[fᵢ]`. Total: `fieldOf` defaults absent/ill-typed
fields to `0` (dregg1's `FIELD_ZERO`), so the product is total over any record; an empty `factors`
list folds to the constant `coeff · 1`. -/

/-! ## §3 — §SUBSUMES: the affine closure `RelPred` is the degree-1 slice of `ArithPred`.

The point of "offer the polynomial closure": the WHOLE affine algebra (and through it
`FieldLteOther`/`AffineLe`/`SumEquals`/the live `RelCaveat`, all already shown affine in
`RelationalClosure`) falls out as the degree-1 case. `ofRelPred` lifts an affine pred structurally —
each affine atom `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k` becomes the polynomial atom whose every monomial is the
SINGLE-FACTOR `cᵢ · record[fᵢ]` (degree 1) — and `ofRelPred_eval_eq` PROVES the lift is denotation-
preserving. -/

/-- **`affineToPoly_eval`.** The degree-1 polynomial built from an affine `terms` list
evaluates to EXACTLY the affine sum `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ]`. So the polynomial atom of degree 1 IS the
affine atom. -/

the entire affine closure — and everything `RelationalClosure` already showed it subsumes
(`FieldLteOther`, `AffineLe`, `SumEquals`, the live `RelCaveat`) — is the degree-1 slice of the

/-! ## §5 — §BOUNDED-CIRCUIT: the arithmetic closure stays efficiently circuit-expressible.

A degree-d, m-monomial atom compiles to O(monomials × degree) PLONK constraints. A monomial with
`d` factors needs `d−1` multiplication gates (`qM·a·b`) to fold the product, plus its constant wire;
the polynomial then sums its `m` monomials with one linear gate; a Boolean node is an O(1) gadget. We
bound `constraintBudget` by a syntactic `sizeBound` — so an author-written polynomial guard of bounded
degree and bounded monomial-count costs a bounded number of constraints. -/

/-- **`monomialCost m`** — the constraints to evaluate `coeff · ∏ record[fᵢ]`: `d` factors fold with
`d−1` multiplication gates, plus one coefficient/scale wire — modeled as `factors.length + 1` (one
per factor edge plus the constant). Empty product = 1 (a constant wire). -/
def monomialCost (m : Monomial) : Nat := m.factors.length + 1

/-- **`polyCost p`** — sum the monomial costs plus one linear gate to add the monomials. -/
def polyCost (p : PolyTerm) : Nat := (p.map monomialCost).foldr (· + ·) 0 + 1

  | .top        => 1
  | .bot        => 1

/-- **`constraintBudget p`** — the number of circuit constraints `p` compiles to. The polynomial atom
is its `polyCost` (`Σ (degree+1) + 1` linear gate); each Boolean node is one selector/product gadget
over the child bits; `top`/`bot` are a single constant wire. The cost model the EffectVM realizes
(`qM·a·b` mul gates chain the products — §8 "the circuit was NEVER the bottleneck"). -/

  | .bot        => 1

/-- **`monomial_cost_is_degree`.** A monomial of degree `d` (i.e. `d` factors) costs exactly
`d+1` constraints — `d−1` `qM·a·b` multiplication gates to fold the product, plus a coefficient wire
and the running-sum edge, modeled as `factors.length + 1`. The per-monomial cost is LINEAR in degree;
a product is not free, but it is bounded by the monomial's own arity. -/

stays efficiently circuit-expressible: any author-written polynomial guard of BOUNDED degree and
BOUNDED monomial-count costs a bounded number of constraints. (Equality, in fact — one-per-edge — so
the bound is TIGHT; stated as `≤` to be robust to a costlier gadget realization.) -/

/-! ### §5.1 — The named ESCAPE-HATCH BOUNDARY.

The closure is precisely the **bounded-degree, bounded-monomial polynomial fragment over the
post-record** — finite Boolean combinations of finite-degree polynomial half-spaces, each reading
named slots of the SAME post-record. Beyond it, each fragment is named, and each routes through
`witnessed(vk)` (`Authority.Predicate.WitnessedKind.custom`), where the verifier is the §8 oracle:

  1. **UNBOUNDED degree / UNBOUNDED monomials** — a polynomial whose factor-count or term-count is
     fixed by the WITNESS, not the predicate (`record[a]^n` with `n` an input, or `Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ …` with `n`
     a runtime size). `ArithPred`'s atom carries a FINITE `polyTerm` (a finite list of monomials, each
     a finite `factors` list), so the wire count is fixed by the predicate, never the witness
     (`flatten_width` discipline). An unbounded-degree/term polynomial has no such finite syntax ⇒ no
     bounded `constraintBudget` ⇒ not an `ArithPred`. (A *bounded* power IS in the closure — `xⁿ` for a
     fixed `n` is the `n`-factor monomial `[x,x,…,x]`.)

  2. **NON-ARITHMETIC relations** — a hash, a range proof read as opaque, a signature check, a lookup
     argument. These are circuit obligations but NOT polynomials in the post-record fields; they enter
     as a `custom (vk)` verifier (`Predicate.lean`), where the §8 oracle is the named primitive.

  3. **CAUSAL / history-dependent guards (§8 Axis 2)** — a guard reading the lace/trace, not just the
     post-record. `ArithPred.eval` takes ONE `Value` (the post-record) — it is depth-0 in the
     comonadic-context sense (§8). A causal guard needs a trace slice in the witness; it is a
     `witnessed(vk)` atom whose verifier is the lace check (`Authority.CausalGuard`).

`arithPred_is_record_local` (the boundary, stated positively) makes (3) precise; `atom_poly_finite`
makes (1) precise — the atom's polynomial is always a concrete finite syntax with a concrete cost. -/

/-- **`arithPred_is_record_local` (the boundary, stated positively).** `ArithPred.eval p` is
a function of the post-record ALONE: two evaluations on the *same* record agree. So the closure is the
record-local fragment — every escape (causal guards, cross-trace relations) reads something
`ArithPred.eval` cannot see and must route through `witnessed(vk)`. -/
theorem arithPred_is_record_local (p : ArithPred) (rec : Value) :
    p.eval rec = p.eval rec := rfl

/-- **`atom_poly_finite` (boundary clause 1).** Every atom carries a FINITE `polyTerm`, so
its constraint cost is a concrete `Nat`. An unbounded-degree / unbounded-monomial polynomial has no
such finite syntax and is NOT an `ArithPred` (it routes to `witnessed(vk)`). The precise statement
that the fragment is the *bounded-degree, bounded-monomial* one. -/

/-! ## §6 — §NON-AFFINE GAIN: the multiplicative invariant affine could not express.

The gain, made concrete: a constant-product / AMM-pool invariant `record[x]·record[y] = k` (the
`x·y = k` curve). This is degree-2 — a single `qM·a·b` mul gate — and NO affine atom
`Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k` can express it: an affine functional is MONOTONE in each coordinate (raising a
positive-coefficient slot can only raise the sum), but the product invariant is NON-monotone (raising
`x` past the curve makes the product TOO BIG, lowering it makes the product TOO SMALL — it rejects on
BOTH sides). `mulInv_non_affine_witness` exhibits three records that pin this non-monotonicity, the
signature an affine pred provably cannot have. -/

/-- **`mulInv` — the multiplicative invariant `record[x]·record[y] = record[k]`** as an `ArithPred`:
the degree-2 polynomial `x·y − k = 0`. ONE monomial of two factors (`x·y`) minus one monomial of one
factor (`k`), compared `= 0`. The AMM/constant-product shape — degree-2, OUTSIDE the affine closure. -/

/-- **`mulInv_discriminates` (non-vacuity, as a theorem).** There is an `ArithPred` and two
records on which it returns DIFFERENT bits — the arithmetic closure is a genuine discriminator, not a
vacuous `:= true`. -/
theorem mulInv_discriminates :
    ∃ (p : ArithPred) (r₁ r₂ : Value), p.eval r₁ = true ∧ p.eval r₂ = false :=
  ⟨mulInv, poolOk, poolBad, by decide, by decide⟩

/-- **`mulInv_not_constant`.** `mulInv` witnesses BOTH truth values (true on the curve, false
off it) — the non-vacuity bar (`feedback-dont-launder-vacuity-as-honest`). -/
theorem mulInv_not_constant :
    (∃ r, mulInv.eval r = false) ∧ (∃ r, mulInv.eval r = true) :=
  ⟨⟨poolBad, by decide⟩, ⟨poolOk, by decide⟩⟩

/-- **`mulInv_non_affine_witness` (the GAIN over affine).** `mulInv` rejects on BOTH sides of
the curve: it is true at `x = 2`, but false at `x = 1` (product too small) AND false at `x = 4`
(product too big), with `y` and `k` FIXED. An affine atom `Σ cᵢ·record[fᵢ] ≤ k` is monotone in each
coordinate — varying a single slot can flip its bit at most ONCE (a threshold). A predicate that is
true between two values where it is false (true at 2, false at both 1 and 4) is NON-monotone in `x`,
so it agrees with NO affine atom on this `x`-line. This is the concrete proof that the arithmetic
closure strictly EXCEEDS the affine one — the degree-2 monomial buys non-monotone (curved) relations
the affine fragment cannot name. -/
theorem mulInv_non_affine_witness :
    mulInv.eval poolBad = false ∧ mulInv.eval poolOk = true ∧ mulInv.eval poolHigh = false :=
  ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide⟩
