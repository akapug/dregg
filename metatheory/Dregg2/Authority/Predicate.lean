# Dregg2.Authority.Predicate — the WitnessedPredicate registry: verify/find seam plugins.

Models dregg1's `WitnessedPredicateRegistry` (`cell/src/predicate.rs`): a map from
`WitnessedPredicateKind` (`Dfa | Temporal | MerkleMembership | NonMembership | Pedersen |
BlindedSet | Bridge | Custom{vk_hash}`) to decidable verifier plugins. Each plugin is a
`Verify : statement → witness → Bool` in the TCB; the registry dispatches by kind. The
prover (the `WitnessProducer` / matcher) is the untrusted `find` side: opaque, no
completeness, no termination.

Keystone: a witness the registry accepts for a kind discharges that kind's predicate
(soundness-by-verification), holding against any prover including adversarial ones.

§8 portal: the actual crypto soundness of the crypto kinds (Merkle binding, Pedersen
homomorphism, STARK extractability) is NEVER a Lean law. For those kinds the registry
routes through `CryptoKernel.verify` — the §8 oracle. The Lean law models dispatch +
soundness-by-verification only; the `find`/prover stays untrusted and undecidable.

Pure, `#eval`-able. Defines only new names under `namespace Dregg2.Authority.Predicate`.

/-! ## The registry = a map of verifier plugins; dispatch by kind. -/

/-- A single verifier plugin: the decidable, in-TCB `Verify : stmt → witness → Bool`. This is the
`WitnessedPredicateVerifier::verify` method (`predicate.rs:489`) — pure, no state mutation, a
checkable accept/reject bit. -/
abbrev Verifier (Stmt Wit : Type) := Stmt → Wit → Bool

/-- **The registry** (lift of `WitnessedPredicateRegistry`, `predicate.rs:658`). A map from kind to
the verifier plugin installed for that kind. `none` means "no verifier registered for this kind"
(dregg1's `KindNotRegistered`); the built-ins live under the closed kinds, `custom (vk)` under the
`vk`-keyed entry. Modelling statement/witness abstractly keeps the law parametric over the actual
proof algebra (which, for the crypto kinds, is the §8 `CryptoKernel.verify` oracle). -/
abbrev Registry (Stmt Wit : Type) := WitnessedKind → Option (Verifier Stmt Wit)

/-- **The dispatch** (lift of `WitnessedPredicateRegistry::verify`, `predicate.rs:844`): look up the
verifier for `k`, then run it. `none` (no registered verifier) fails closed — `false`, never an
accept. This is the only TCB action: route by kind, run the in-TCB checker. -/
def registryVerify {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind) (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit) : Bool :=
  match reg k with
  | some v => v stmt wit
  | none   => false

/-- **A registry instantiates the abstract verify/find seam (`Laws.Verifiable`) at a fixed kind.**
The predicate is the *statement-for-kind-`k`* and the witness is `Wit`; `Verify` is the dispatch at
`k`. This is how the registry's per-kind checker becomes the seam's decidable `Verify` — exactly the
move `Crypto.verifiableOfCryptoKernel` makes for the bare CryptoKernel, lifted through dispatch. -/
instance verifiableOfRegistry {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind) : Verifiable Stmt Wit where
  Verify stmt wit := registryVerify reg k stmt wit

/-- `Discharged` under the registry-at-`k` instance is *definitionally* "the registry accepts": the
seam object and the dispatch coincide. -/

  Iff.rfl

/-! ## The keystone — soundness-by-verification through the registry. -/

/-- **`registry_sound`** — a witness the registry accepts for kind `k` discharges that
kind's predicate. Soundness-by-verification through `Laws.Discharged` at the registry-at-`k`
seam instance. The TCB is the registry's `Verify`; nothing about the prover enters. -/
theorem registry_sound {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind) (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit)
    (haccept : registryVerify reg k stmt wit = true) :
    @Discharged Stmt Wit (verifiableOfRegistry reg k) stmt wit :=
  -- `Discharged` at this instance unfolds, by defeq, to exactly `registryVerify … = true`.
  haccept

/-- **`registry_sound_find` — the keystone wired to the untrusted `find` (reuses `search_sound`'s
shape).** Given the prover plugin (`Laws.Searchable.find`, the untrusted `WitnessProducer`) returns
`some wit` for a statement AND the registry independently ACCEPTS it, the witness is discharged. The
prover only *proposes*; acceptance is decided solely by the in-TCB dispatch. This is the
`predicate.rs` contract literally: the producer is the left adjoint, the registry is the gate. -/
theorem registry_sound_find {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind)
    [Searchable Stmt Wit] (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit)
    (_hfound : Searchable.find stmt = some wit)
    (haccept : registryVerify reg k stmt wit = true) :
    @Discharged Stmt Wit (verifiableOfRegistry reg k) stmt wit :=
  -- `_hfound` is irrelevant to soundness: the gate, not the producer, decides. We carry it to
  -- document the seam (a returned witness must still pass `Verify`); soundness is `haccept` alone.
  registry_sound reg k stmt wit haccept

/-! ## The prover side carries no completeness / termination guarantee. -/

/-- **`find_untrusted`** — a prover returning `none` does not imply no witness exists.
Concretely: there exist a registry and a statement where the prover gives up yet the
registry accepts `()`. Completeness is not on the table. -/
theorem find_untrusted :
    ∃ (Stmt Wit : Type) (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind)
      (find : Stmt → Option Wit) (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit),
        find stmt = none ∧ registryVerify reg k stmt wit = true := by
  refine ⟨Unit, Unit, (fun _ => some (fun _ _ => true)), .dfa, (fun _ => none), (), (), rfl, ?_⟩
  -- The registry has a verifier for `.dfa` that always accepts; dispatch returns its bit.
  rfl

/-- **`adversarial_find_cannot_forge` — soundness holds against ANY prover.** No matter what witness
an adversarial prover synthesizes, it cannot make the registry accept against an honest verifier
that rejects it: if the kind-`k` verifier rejects `(stmt, wit)`, the dispatch rejects too — there is
no prover-controlled path to acceptance. The prover is fully quantified over and never appears in the
conclusion: the gate is the sole authority. -/
theorem adversarial_find_cannot_forge {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (reg : Registry Stmt Wit) (k : WitnessedKind) (v : Verifier Stmt Wit)
    (hreg : reg k = some v) (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit)

/-! ## `custom_is_open_extension` — `custom (vk)` is the content-addressed open extension point. -/

/-- **`custom_is_open_extension`.** Registering an app verifier under `custom (vk)` makes the
registry dispatch *that* verifier for *that* `vk`, and soundness flows through unchanged: an accepted
witness discharges. This is dregg1's `custom` map keyed on `vk_hash` (`predicate.rs:300`,
`predicate.rs:660`) — the open variant for app-registered kinds, content-addressed by `vk`. The
built-in kinds are untouched (we only override the `custom vk` slot). -/
theorem custom_is_open_extension {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (base : Registry Stmt Wit) (vk : Nat) (v : Verifier Stmt Wit)
    (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit) (haccept : v stmt wit = true) :

      fun k => if k = .custom vk then some v else base k
    @Discharged Stmt Wit (verifiableOfRegistry reg (.custom vk)) stmt wit := by
  intro reg
  -- Dispatch at `custom vk` resolves to `v`, which accepts; keystone closes it.
  apply registry_sound reg (.custom vk) stmt wit
  show registryVerify reg (.custom vk) stmt wit = true
  unfold registryVerify
  simp only [reg, if_pos rfl, haccept]

/-- **`custom_distinct_vk` — content-addressing separates extensions.** Two custom kinds with
DISTINCT `vk`s are distinct registry keys, so a verifier installed at `custom vk₁` is NOT consulted
for `custom vk₂`. This is the `vk_hash`-keying that makes the open extension point collision-safe:
distinct predicate bytes ⇒ distinct `vk` ⇒ distinct dispatch slot. -/
theorem custom_distinct_vk {Stmt Wit : Type}
    (base : Registry Stmt Wit) (vk₁ vk₂ : Nat) (hne : vk₁ ≠ vk₂) (v : Verifier Stmt Wit)
    (stmt : Stmt) (wit : Wit) :
    let reg : Registry Stmt Wit :=
      fun k => if k = .custom vk₁ then some v else base k
    registryVerify reg (.custom vk₂) stmt wit = registryVerify base (.custom vk₂) stmt wit := by

/-! ## Routing a crypto kind through the §8 oracle.

For the crypto kinds (`pedersen`, `merkleMembership`, …) the verifier plugin is the
`CryptoKernel.verify` oracle (§8 portal). The Lean law models the dispatch and
soundness-by-verification discipline; it never reasons into the crypto. -/

/-- The verifier plugin for a crypto kind = the §8 `CryptoKernel.verify` oracle, wrapped to the
registry's `Verifier` shape (statement = `Digest`, witness = `Proof`). -/
def cryptoVerifier {Digest Proof : Type} [AddCommGroup Digest] [CryptoKernel Digest Proof] :
    Verifier Digest Proof :=
  fun stmt proof => CryptoKernel.verify stmt proof

/-- **`crypto_kind_routes_to_oracle`** — when a crypto kind is registered with the
`CryptoKernel.verify` oracle, an accepted proof discharges the kind's predicate. Acceptance
means the oracle said true; no Lean reasoning into the crypto occurs. Binding and
extractability remain circuit obligations (§8 portal). -/
theorem crypto_kind_routes_to_oracle {Digest Proof : Type} [AddCommGroup Digest]
    [CryptoKernel Digest Proof]
    (base : Registry Digest Proof) (k : WitnessedKind) (stmt : Digest) (proof : Proof)
    (horacle : CryptoKernel.verify stmt proof = true) :
    let reg : Registry Digest Proof := fun j => if j = k then some cryptoVerifier else base j
    @Discharged Digest Proof (verifiableOfRegistry reg k) stmt proof := by
