# Dregg2.Proof.BeaconSpace — a probability-space portal over the randomness beacon.

Closes the residual from `Dregg2.Proof.Synchronizer` (§5 OPEN): `World.rand` is a deterministic
value oracle, so the almost-sure `tsum = 1` result cannot produce a constructive hit-index.
This portal supplies a `Measure` over beacon streams `ℕ → Bool` (per-view honest-leader indicators)
with the relay's Bernoulli-per-view + cross-view-independence law as a structure field, then proves:
`noHonestEverGe_measure_zero` (measure-0 tail), `honestLeader_ae_ge` (almost-every hit at or past
any bound), `honestLeader_index_exists_ge` (the constructive hit-index), and
`synchronizer_round_obtains_over_beacon` (full discharge of `Synchronizer`'s `hhit` hypothesis).

All model assumptions are structure fields (not `axiom`s); keystones are `#assert_axioms`-clean.
Non-vacuity is witnessed by the concrete all-honest Dirac beacon (`§4`); the interior Bernoulli
product witness is in `BeaconSpaceInterior`.

OPEN (§6): the canonical interior non-vacuity witness requires `Mathlib.Probability.ProductMeasure`
(`Measure.infinitePi`); the Dirac boundary witness (`h = 1`) is used here instead.

/-! ## 1. The `BeaconSpace` portal — a probability space over the randomness beacon.

`BeaconSpace` complements `World`: where `World` carries the beacon as a deterministic value oracle
(`rand : Nat → Nat`), `BeaconSpace` carries it as a probability space — a `Measure` over beacon
streams `ℕ → Bool` (per-view honest-leader indicators), bundled with the relay's Bernoulli(`h`)-per-
view + cross-view-independence law as a single explicit field. The honest-leader event at view `v`
is `stream v = true`. -/

/-- **The randomness-beacon probability space** (ELRS §5 / Cogsworth `Relay(r,k)`). Fields:

* `μ` — a probability `Measure` over beacon streams `ℕ → Bool`; `ω v = true` iff the relay's
  view-`v` leader is honest.
* `h` / `honest_pos` / `honest_super` / `honest_le_one` — the honest fraction with the BFT
  supermajority `2/3 < h ≤ 1`.
* `indep_block` — **per-view Bernoulli(`h`) + cross-view independence.** For any start `b` and
  length `N`, the cylinder "every view in `[b, b+N)` is dishonest" has mass `(1-h)^N`: the `N`
  views are independent with per-view dishonest probability `1-h`. Subsumes the single-view marginal
  (`N = 1`) and the prefix cylinder (`b = 0`). The runtime beacon discharges it as a carried field,
  exactly as `World.gst_liveness` is discharged by a partially-synchronous runtime.

All fields are explicit hypotheses, not axioms; `§4` witnesses a concrete instance. -/

/-! ## 2. The no-honest-leader tail events and their measures.

`noHonestBlock b N` is "every view in `[b, b+N)` is dishonest"; its measure is `(1-h)^N` by
`indep_block`. `noHonestEverGe b` is the intersection over all `N` — "no honest leader in any
view `≥ b`". Continuity from above (`tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop`) pushes `(1-h)^N → 0` through
to measure `0`. Setting `b = 0` recovers the global no-honest-ever event. -/

/-- **The "the `N` views starting at `b` are all dishonest" event.** -/
def noHonestBlock (b N : ℕ) : Set (ℕ → Bool) := {ω | ∀ i, b ≤ i → i < b + N → ω i = false}

/-- **The "no honest leader in any view `≥ b`" event** — the intersection of all `noHonestBlock b N`.
A stream is in it iff every view at or past `b` is dishonest. -/
def noHonestEverGe (b : ℕ) : Set (ℕ → Bool) := ⋂ N, noHonestBlock b N

/-- The block events are antitone in `N`: more views constrained ⇒ smaller event. -/

  B.indep_block b N

/-- **The masses `(1-h)^N` tend to `0`**: `0 ≤ 1-h < 1` gives `(1-h)^N → 0` in `ℝ`;
`ENNReal.ofReal` is continuous, so the masses converge to `0` in `ℝ≥0∞`. -/

theorem noHonestEver_measure_zero : B.μ (noHonestEverGe 0) = 0 :=
  noHonestEverGe_measure_zero B 0

/-! ## 3. The almost-everywhere hit and the constructive hit-index.

From `μ (noHonestEverGe b) = 0`: almost every stream has an honest view at or past `b`
(`honestLeader_ae_ge`). Since `μ` is a probability measure the a.e. set is nonempty, so a concrete
stream with a finite honest view at or past `b` exists (`honestLeader_index_exists_ge`) — the
constructive hit-index the deterministic `World.rand` oracle could not supply. -/

/-- **Almost every beacon stream has an honest leader at or past any bound `b`**: for `μ`-a.e. `ω`
there is a view `r ≥ b` with `honestLeader r ω`. The shifted form needed by the synchronizer (the
hit lands past `max t gst`). -/

  filter_upwards [honestLeader_ae_ge B 0] with ω hω
  obtain ⟨r, _, hr⟩ := hω; exact ⟨r, hr⟩

/-- **A concrete honest-leader hit-index at or past any bound `b` exists.** Because `μ` is a
probability measure the a.e. set is inhabited, so there is an actual stream `ω` and view `r ≥ b`
with `honestLeader r ω`. This is the constructive hit-index `synchronizer_round_obtains`
consumes as `hhit` — the bridge the deterministic oracle could not cross. -/
theorem honestLeader_index_exists_ge (B : BeaconSpace) (b : ℕ) :
    ∃ (ω : ℕ → Bool) (r : ℕ), b ≤ r ∧ honestLeader r ω := by
  obtain ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩ := (honestLeader_ae_ge B b).exists
  exact ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩

  obtain ⟨ω, r, _, hr⟩ := honestLeader_index_exists_ge B 0
  exact ⟨ω, r, hr⟩

/-! ## 4. The discharge — reducing `Synchronizer`'s `hhit` to the BeaconSpace.

`Synchronizer.synchronizer_round_obtains` takes a `hhit` hypothesis: "there is a view `r ≥ max t
gst` whose leader is honest". The BeaconSpace supplies that index via
`honestLeader_index_exists_ge` at `b := max t gst`. We build a `LeaderRotation` whose honesty
predicate is the witnessing stream and feed it to `synchronizer_round_obtains`, obtaining the
synchronization round with no `hhit` hypothesis remaining. -/

open Dregg2 Dregg2.World

variable {Msg : Type} [World Msg]

/-- **The BeaconSpace discharges `Synchronizer`'s `hhit` at any threshold**: for any bound `b` there
is a beacon stream and a view `r ≥ b` with an honest leader — the materialized hit
`synchronizer_round_obtains` needs as `hhit`. -/

    ∃ (ω : ℕ → Bool) (r : ℕ), b ≤ r ∧ honestLeader r ω :=
  honestLeader_index_exists_ge B b

/-- **The synchronization round obtains over the BeaconSpace with no `hhit` hypothesis.** We build
the `Synchronizer.LeaderRotation` whose honesty predicate is the witnessing beacon stream, extract
the hit-index past `max t gst` from the measure, and feed it to `synchronizer_round_obtains`. The
rotation's honesty schedule is the stream `ω` itself (`honestLeader v := ω v = true`), tying
`honestLeader` to the beacon outcome the §5 OPEN named. -/

  obtain ⟨ω, r, hbr, hr⟩ := honestLeader_index_exists_ge B (max t gst)
  -- read the rotation's honesty schedule off the witnessing stream.

      honestLeader := fun v => ω v = true }
  -- the hit-index discharges `synchronizer_round_obtains`'s `hhit` over the beacon.

/-! ## 4½. The beacon derives the `Pacemaker.synchronizes` honest-leader field.

`BFTLiveness.Pacemaker.synchronizes : ∀ t, ∃ r, t ≤ r ∧ gst ≤ r ∧ honestLeader r` requires a
concrete honest-leader view at or past any round. Defining `honestLeader` as "some beacon stream
elects an honest leader at view `r`", the beacon derives `synchronizes` from the almost-sure hit —
turning that field from an assumption into a consequence of the honest fraction `h > 2/3`. -/

/-- **The beacon's honest-leader predicate** — "some beacon stream elects an honest leader at view
`r`". Used to discharge the `Pacemaker.synchronizes` honest-leader conjunct. -/
def beaconHonestLeader (r : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ ω : ℕ → Bool, honestLeader r ω

/-- **The beacon derives `Pacemaker.synchronizes`.** For any `gst` and round `t`, there is a later
view `r ≥ t` past GST with `beaconHonestLeader r`. The hit-index comes from
`honestLeader_index_exists_ge` at `max t gst`; the `t ≤ r ∧ gst ≤ r` bounds come from the
threshold. The `synchronizes` field's honest-leader content is a consequence of `h > 2/3`, not an
assumption. -/

/-- **A `BFTLiveness.Pacemaker` built over the beacon**, given the legitimate delivery primitives.
`synchronizes` is derived from the beacon's almost-sure hit; the remaining fields are the honest
BFT/DLS88 primitives — `honest_quorum` (the `n > 3f` / `h > 2/3` floor: honest set ≥ threshold)
and `honest_le_delivered` (HotStuff Thm 4 @ DLS88 Δ-delivery: honest votes delivered post-GST).
Neither is "the quorum forms"; the quorum is derived by

/-! ## 6. Axiom hygiene — every keystone is kernel-clean.

All theorems reduce to `BeaconSpace` structure fields (hypotheses, not axioms) and mathlib lemmas
(`tendsto_measure_iInter_atTop`, `tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one`,
`ENNReal.tendsto_ofReal`); none pull any oracle axiom.

OPEN (non-vacuity interior witness): the canonical `Measure.infinitePi (PMF.bernoulli h).toMeasure`
witness at `h = 3/4` needs `Mathlib.Probability.ProductMeasure` (`Measure.infinitePi`). The
`BeaconSpace` interface and §1–§4 results are `h`-generic; only the interior witness is gated on
that module. `BeaconSpaceInterior` supplies it. The interior witness wants
`MeasureTheory.Measure.infinitePi_cylinder`-style block-mass `= ∏ (1-h)` for `indep_block`. -/
