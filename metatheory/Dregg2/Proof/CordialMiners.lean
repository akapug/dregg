# Dregg2.Proof.CordialMiners — the ACTUAL DAG-BFT consensus dregg1 runs, modeled
# faithfully, with a real safety theorem proved by transferring the BFT quorum-
# intersection core onto the leaderless DAG.

**The model-mismatch this closes.** `Dregg2/Proof/BFT.lean` modeled classical quorum-voting BFT
(rounds of explicit votes, `n − f` quorum, honest-vote-once → Malkhi–Reiter intersection). But
dregg1 does NOT run classical voting BFT: it runs
**Cordial Miners** (Keidar–Naor–Shapiro–Spiegelman, arXiv:2205.09174), a *leaderless DAG-BFT*
where blocks reference predecessors forming a DAG and ordering/finality is *derived from the
DAG structure + quorum reads*, never from a round of votes. The concrete protocol lives in
`blocklace/src/ordering.rs` (the `tau` total-ordering) and `blocklace/src/finality.rs`.

This file models THAT protocol — the real `ordering.rs` commit rule — and proves a real
safety property about IT, **reusing** the classical `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection`
(the `n > 3f` quorum-intersection-at-an-honest-process core) and the
`Authority.Blocklace` equivocation machinery as *feeders*. The quorum-intersection argument
is protocol-agnostic; the contribution here is wiring it to the DAG commit rule dregg1 runs.

## What `ordering.rs` actually does (the rule we model — with refs)

* **Round** (`ordering.rs::compute_rounds`, doc §"Round"): a block's DAG depth — `1 + max`
  predecessor round; genesis = round 1.
* **Wave** (`ordering.rs::round_to_wave`, §"Wave"): a group of `wavelength` consecutive
  rounds. Each wave has a **leader** chosen round-robin (`ordering.rs::wave_leader`).
* **Supermajority** (`ordering.rs::supermajority_threshold`): `⌊2n/3⌋ + 1` — the `> 2n/3`
  DAG-BFT quorum (this is the `n − f` quorum when `n = 3f+1`).
* **approves** (`ordering.rs::approves`): block `o` approves leader `l` iff `l` is in `o`'s
  **causal past** (`precedes`) AND no equivocation by `l.creator` is visible from `o`
  (`has_equivocation_in_past`). This is the Byzantine-repelling read — `Authority.Blocklace`.
* **ratifies** (`ordering.rs::ratifies`): `o` ratifies `l` iff a **supermajority of distinct
  participants** each have an approving block in `o`'s past.
* **super-ratified / FINAL LEADER** (`ordering.rs::is_super_ratified`,
  `find_all_final_leaders`): `l` is committed iff (i) the leader has **exactly one** block at
  the wave's first round (`leader_blocks.len() == 1` — no leader equivocation) AND (ii) a
  **supermajority of distinct participants** have wave-end blocks that ratify `l`. A
  super-ratified leader **anchors** a segment of the total order (`tau`).

So a block is committed (becomes a final leader anchoring `tau`) exactly when a `> 2n/3`
quorum of distinct participants ratifies it at the wave end — the DAG analogue of "a quorum
voted", with the vote replaced by a *causal-past read* of approval.

## The safety theorem proved (`cordial_agreement`)

**No two distinct leader-candidate blocks for the same wave can both be super-ratified.**
Each super-ratification carries a supermajority (`≥ n − f`) of distinct *ratifying
participants*. Treating "participant `p` ratifies leader `l`" as a `Vote ⟨p, l⟩`, two
super-ratifications are two `n − f` quorums; the transferred `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection`
(`n > 3f`) yields an **honest** participant who ratified *both* candidate leaders. The honesty
law (one ratification per wave-position — the DAG form of honest-vote-once: an honest
participant's wave-end block ratifies at most one leader per wave, because ratification reads a
*single* `approves` and an honest node's causal past is fork-free for its own reads) forces the
two leaders equal. This is dregg1's actual finality (`find_all_final_leaders` returns ≤ 1 final
leader per wave) — proved, not assumed.

## SCOPE (named OPENs — NOT sorries)

What this models **faithfully**: the DAG round/wave/leader structure (`ordering.rs`), the
`approves`/`ratifies`/`is_super_ratified` commit rule, and the safety property that a wave has
at most one super-ratified leader, with the `n > 3f` quorum-intersection core *transferred*
from the classical model and the equivocation-repelling read reused from `Authority.Blocklace`.

What remains **idealized** (named `OPEN`s below, never `sorry`/`axiom`):
  * **OPEN-CM-LIVENESS / GST → PROVEN CONDITIONAL.** That a wave *eventually* produces a
    super-ratified leader (the `tau` ordering makes progress) is the post-GST pacemaker argument.
    Unconditional liveness is FLP-impossible, so the honest form is the CONDITIONAL — and it is
    PROVED in `CordialMinersLiveness` §4b: `cm_pacemaker_from_gstModel` discharges the residual from
    the named partial-synchrony carrier (`Proof.GST.GSTModel`), reduced to the FLP-irreducible
    primitives (honest-supermajority + Δ-delivery + bare honest-leader co-finality,
    `cm_liveness_from_cofinality`), with the synchrony hypothesis LOAD-BEARING
    (`cm_liveness_needs_cofinality`). The carrier is a structure-field bundle (a Prop-portal like
    `World.recv_mono`/`gst_liveness`), never an `axiom`/`sorry`. Off the safety critical path.
  * **OPEN-CM-DISSEMINATION.** The gossip/`dissemination.rs` reliable-broadcast that makes a
    block's causal past converge across honest nodes is assumed (the runtime guarantee, like
    `World.recv_mono`), not derived here.
  * **OPEN-CM-STINGRAY.** The Stingray bandwidth/budget accounting (block-rate, equivocation-
    slashing economics) is out of the consensus-safety scope entirely.
  * **OPEN-CM-XSORT.** The deterministic intra-segment `xsort` total order (`ordering.rs::xsort`,
    tie-break by block id) is faithful as a *rule* but its determinism/totality is not
    re-proved here — `cordial_agreement` concerns *which leader anchors*, the load-bearing
    safety question, not the within-segment tie-break.

Every adversary assumption is a
structure field or theorem hypothesis (the `BFT.BFTModel` discipline).

A `CordialState` bundles the blocklace DAG together with the round/wave structure
`ordering.rs` computes from it. We keep `rounds` as a field (the result of `compute_rounds`)

that they are). -/

/-! ## 2. approve / ratify / super-ratify (the commit rule, `ordering.rs`).

We give the *semantic* face of each predicate. The causal-past membership `l ≺ o` is
`Authority.Blocklace.precedes`; the equivocation-visible test is the blocklace's own
`Equivocator` read (`has_equivocation_in_past` is exactly "an equivocation by `l.creator` is
in `o`'s causal past", and `Authority.Blocklace` already proves that read is sound and that an
honest chain never trips it). -/

/-- **`approves S o l`** (`ordering.rs::approves`): observer block `o` approves leader block
`l` iff (1) `l` is in `o`'s causal past (`l ≺ o`, i.e. `observes S.lace o l`) and (2) no
equivocation by `l.creator` is visible from `o`. We render (2) faithfully as
"`l.creator` is not an `Equivocator` of the lace" — the `Authority.Blocklace` predicate that
`has_equivocation_in_past` computes (the observer-restricted form refines this; the sound core
is the blocklace `Equivocator`, and `honest_no_equivocation` discharges it for honest chains). -/

/-! ### 2b. From a lace-read voter set to the BFT `Vote` list (the bridge, COMPUTED).

The crux of closing OPEN-CM-DISSEMINATION's *quorum* half: the `BFT.Vote` list the
quorum-intersection feeder consumes is not an assumed structure field — it is **built
from the participants the lace actually exhibits as ratifiers** (`ratifyingVoters`, the
`HasApprovingBlock`-filter over the real `lace`). `votesFromVoters` materializes one
`Vote ⟨p, bid⟩` per such participant, and `votersFor_votesFromVoters` proves the BFT voter
count of that list is *exactly* the lace-read ratifier count. So `cfg.n - cfg.f ≤ length` is a
fact ABOUT THE LACE, not a hypothesis handed to us. -/

/-- **`votesFromVoters voters bid`** — materialize the BFT ratification votes from a list of
ratifying participants: one `Vote ⟨p, bid⟩` per `p`. This is the *image* of the lace-read
`ratifyingVoters` under "this participant ratifies block `bid`" — the `ratifying_participants`
HashSet of `ordering.rs::is_super_ratified` rendered as the `Vote` set the feeder counts. -/

  voters.map (fun p => ⟨p, bid⟩)

/-- **`votersFor_votesFromVoters` — the count is read off the voter list.** For a
`votesFromVoters voters bid` list, `votersFor … bid` is exactly `voters.dedup`. Every
materialized vote endorses `bid`, so the `filter` keeps all of them and the `map (·.voter)`
recovers `voters`; the `dedup` in `votersFor` is the only residue. Hence the BFT voter count
equals the distinct-ratifier count read from the lace. -/

/-! ### 2c. `superRatifiedFromLace` — the commit condition READ OFF THE LACE.

This is the predicate the audit asked for: `superRatifiedFromLace S cfg l` does NOT take the
quorum or the unique-leader guard as data. It *reads the real `lace`*:

* there is a wave-end observer block `o ∈ S.lace` whose **lace-computed** ratifier set
  (`ratifyingVoters o l`, the `HasApprovingBlock` filter over the actual blocks) meets the BFT
  quorum `cfg.n - cfg.f` — `ordering.rs::ratifies` evaluated on the DAG; and
* the `leader_blocks.len() == 1` guard holds as a fact about the blocks present in `S.lace`
  (no second `l.creator` block at `l`'s round). -/

/-- **`superRatifiedFromLace S cfg l` (the lace-derived commit predicate).** `l` is a final
leader because the blocklace *exhibits* the ratifying quorum: a wave-end observer `o` in the
lace whose lace-read ratifiers (`ratifyingVoters`) number `≥ n - f`, plus the unique-leader
guard read off the lace. Compare the OLD `SuperRatification`: there `quorum` was a structure
*field* (assumed data); here `quorum_from_lace` is `cfg.n - cfg.f ≤ (S.ratifyingVoters o l).length`
— the count of participants the lace's `approves`/`HasApprovingBlock` read actually produces. -/
structure superRatifiedFromLace (S : CordialState) (cfg : Finality.Config) (l : Block) where

  observer : Block
  /-- The observer is a real block of the lace. -/
  observer_mem : observer ∈ S.lace

  ratifiers of `l` (those with an approving block in `o`'s causal past — `ratifyingVoters`
  computed over `S.lace`) meet the BFT quorum `n - f`. NOT a field of assumed votes: the count
  is `ordering.rs::ratifies` evaluated on the actual DAG. -/
  quorum_from_lace : cfg.n - cfg.f ≤ (S.ratifyingVoters observer l).length

  its creator at its round among the blocks present in `S.lace`. -/
  unique_leader : ∀ b ∈ S.lace, b.creator = l.creator → S.rounds b.id = S.rounds l.id → b = l

/-! ## 3. The super-ratification quorum as a `BFT.Vote` set — the feeder bridge.

`ordering.rs::is_super_ratified` counts **distinct participants** with a wave-end block that
ratifies the leader. That is exactly a *quorum of distinct voters* — the shape
`Dregg2.World.votersFor` / `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection` consume. We expose the
super-ratification evidence as a `List Vote`, one `⟨participant, leaderBlockId⟩` per ratifying
participant, so the classical BFT quorum-intersection lemma applies verbatim. -/

/-- **`SuperRatification S cfg l`** (`ordering.rs::is_super_ratified` + the
`leader_blocks.len() == 1` guard of `find_all_final_leaders`): the *evidence* that leader block
`l` is a final leader (committed / anchors `tau`). It carries:
* `votes` — the ratification votes, one `Vote ⟨p, l.id⟩` per distinct wave-end participant `p`
  that ratifies `l` (the `ratifying_participants : HashSet` of `is_super_ratified`);
* `quorum` — that the distinct ratifiers meet the BFT quorum `n − f` (the `> 2n/3`
  supermajority is `≥ n − f`; we state the `n − f` form the feeder needs);
* `unique_leader` — the `leader_blocks.len() == 1` guard: `l` is the *only* block by its
  creator at the wave's first round (no leader equivocation at the anchor position). -/
structure SuperRatification (S : CordialState) (cfg : Finality.Config) (l : Block) where
  /-- The ratification votes: distinct participants endorsing `l` as final leader. -/

  /-- Every vote here endorses *this* leader block (`l.id`). -/
  votes_for_l : ∀ v ∈ votes, v.block = l.id

  unique_leader : ∀ b ∈ S.lace, b.creator = l.creator → S.rounds b.id = S.rounds l.id → b = l

/-- **`Committed S cfg l`** — a block is **committed** (a final leader anchoring `tau`) exactly
when the lace EXHIBITS the ratifying quorum (`superRatifiedFromLace`). This is
`find_all_final_leaders` pushing `l` onto `final_leaders`: the commit decision is the
lace-read `ratifies`/`is_super_ratified`, NOT a hypothesized vote set. -/

lace-read `superRatifiedFromLace` we *construct* the BFT-feeder `SuperRatification`, with its
`votes` **built from the lace's own ratifier set** (`votesFromVoters (ratifyingVoters o l) l.id`)
and its `quorum` field **derived** (via `length_votersFor_votesFromVoters_of_nodup`) from
`quorum_from_lace` — the count the lace exhibits. So the quorum the safety theorem consumes is
not assumed data: it is computed from the approving blocks in the real `lace`. -/

/-! ## 4. THE SAFETY THEOREM — `cordial_agreement` (reusing the BFT + Blocklace feeders).

Two leader candidates that are both super-ratified, with their ratifications counted by the
*same* distinct-participant universe, cannot be distinct blocks. The `n > 3f` quorum-
intersection core is **transferred** from `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection`: the two
`n − f` ratification quorums share an **honest** participant, who therefore ratified both
candidate leaders — and the honesty law (one ratification per wave-position) forces them
equal. This is dregg1's `find_all_final_leaders` returning at most one final leader per wave,
proved from the DAG commit rule. -/

/-- **`cordial_agreement` — DAG-BFT safety / agreement.** Given a `BFT.BFTModel` over
the *combined* ratification votes of two super-ratification candidates `l₁ l₂`, if a single
honest participant cannot ratify two distinct leaders for the same wave position
(`honest_one_ratification` — the DAG form of honest-vote-once), then two super-ratified leaders
are the **same block**. The `n > 3f` quorum intersection is supplied verbatim by the BFT feeder
`honest_witness_in_intersection`; the honest witness ratified both, so the honesty law collapses
`l₁ = l₂`.

This is exactly `ordering.rs::find_all_final_leaders`'s implicit invariant — a wave anchors a
*single* segment of `tau` — recovered as a theorem about the protocol dregg1 runs. -/

/-! ## 5. The honesty law is DISCHARGEABLE from `Authority.Blocklace`, not assumed ad hoc.

`honest_one_ratification` is not a fresh oracle: it is the ratification-level shadow of
`Authority.Blocklace.honest_no_equivocation`. Here we show one concrete way it is met — when
the leader id pins the leader block (canonical lace) and the wave-position is
shared, an honest ratifier's *single* `approves` read forces the ids equal. The general
discharge is the OPEN-CM-DISSEMINATION reliable-broadcast convergence; this lemma exhibits the
non-vacuous core: under id-determinism the hypothesis reduces to the BFT honest-vote-once. -/

/-- **`honest_one_ratification_of_bft`** — the DAG honesty law is *implied by* the
classical `BFTModel.honest_vote_once` over the same vote union. So feeding `cordial_agreement`
its honesty hypothesis costs nothing beyond what the BFT model already grants: the ratification
honesty law IS honest-vote-once on the ratification votes. This is the precise sense in which
the classical core transfers — the DAG protocol's honesty assumption is the classical one,
read on `Vote ⟨participant, leaderId⟩`. -/

/-- **`cordial_agreement_via_bft`** — the packaged safety theorem. Under a `BFTModel` over the
combined ratification votes plus id-determinism, two super-ratified leaders are equal. The
honesty law is discharged by the BFT model's `honest_vote_once` directly
(`honest_one_ratification_of_bft`); no separate oracle. Dregg1's Cordial-Miners finality is safe,
with safety inherited from the classical BFT quorum-intersection core. -/

/-! ### 5b. THE LACE-DERIVED SAFETY THEOREM — quorum read off the blocklace.

This is the form the faithfulness audit demanded: `cordial_agreement` whose ratifying quorum is
**derived from the lace** (`superRatifiedFromLace` → `SuperRatification.ofLace`), not handed to
us as a structure field. The two commit hypotheses `Committed S cfg lᵢ` say "the blocklace
exhibits an `≥ n-f` ratifier read for `lᵢ`"; we materialize each lace ratifier set into the BFT
feeder's `Vote` list (with the count *preserved*, by `votersFor_votesFromVoters`) and run the
exact same quorum-intersection core. What moved assumed→derived: the `> 2n/3` quorum (now
`ratifyingVoters … |>.length` over the real `lace`) and the unique-leader guard (now a read of
the blocks present in `S.lace`). -/

/-- **`cordial_agreement_from_lace` — DAG-BFT safety with the quorum READ OFF THE
LACE.** Two blocks each `Committed` (i.e. each satisfying `superRatifiedFromLace`: the lace
exhibits an `≥ n-f` ratifier read) cannot be distinct, under the honest BFT model over the
*materialized* ratification votes (built from each leader's lace ratifier set) plus
id-determinism. The quorum the intersection core consumes is `(ratifyingVoters …).length` over
the actual blocklace — not an assumed `SuperRatification.quorum` field. This is the audit's
target: the safety theorem is now about the PROTOCOL's lace-read commit rule.

**OPEN-CM-DISSEMINATION (the precise irreducible residual).** What is *still* assumed, and is
the gossip/reliable-broadcast convergence (off the safety critical path):
  1. `M : BFTModel cfg (…)` — the adversary/honesty discipline (`≤ f` Byzantine among actual
     ratifiers, `n > 3f`, honest-vote-once) over the materialized ratification votes. This is
     the *same* assumed adversary model `BFT.lean` carries (the `World.recv_mono`-style
     discipline), now read on the lace ratifiers rather than on abstract votes.
  2. `hid_inj` — content-addressing at the anchor (`Lace.Canonical`): the leader id pins the
     block. A §8 crypto-seam fact, never a Lean theorem (`Blocklace` header).
  3. That the two lace ratifier reads draw from a *common* honest participant universe — i.e.
     the honest nodes' causal pasts have converged enough that a shared honest ratifier of one
     leader is visible as a ratifier of the other (the gossip convergence). This is the genuine
     `dissemination.rs` reliable-broadcast guarantee; it enters here as the BFT model's
     `population_bound`/`fault_bound` being stated over the *union* vote universe. It is NOT
     derived: deriving it is the post-GST liveness/dissemination argument (same residual as
     `BFT.lean`'s O2). What IS now derived (was assumed before): the per-leader `≥ n-f` ratifier
     COUNT and the unique-leader guard — both read off `S.lace`. -/

/-! ## 6. Non-vacuity — a `superRatifiedFromLace` leader whose quorum IS COMPUTED FROM THE LACE.

This is the load-bearing non-vacuity for the de-vacuification: a concrete blocklace `ratLace`
that ACTUALLY CONTAINS the ratifying blocks, so the `≥ n - f` quorum is *read off the lace's
`ratifyingVoters`* (the `HasApprovingBlock` filter over real blocks), not handed in as a vote
list. Compare the OLD witness, which supplied `votes := [⟨0,…⟩,⟨1,…⟩,⟨2,…⟩]` directly — that is
exactly the "assumed data" the audit flagged. Here the three ratifiers `0,1,2` are forced to be
in `ratifyingVoters ratObserver ratLeader` because the lace holds their approving blocks
`ra0,ra1,ra2`, each of which (i) is by that participant, (ii) is in the observer `ro`'s causal
past, and (iii) approves `ratLeader` (acks it, and its honest author 7 is no equivocator).

The lace `ratLace`:
* `rg0` (id 100, author 7, round 1) — genesis of the honest leader strand;
* `ratLeader = rg1` (id 101, author 7, round 2) — the final-leader CANDIDATE;
* `ra0/ra1/ra2` (ids 110/111/112, authors 0/1/2, round 3) — each acks `rg1` (so each *approves*
  it: `rg1 ≺ ra_i` and author 7 is honest ⇒ not an equivocator);
* `ratObserver = ro` (id 120, author 0, round 4) — acks all three approvers, so all three
  approving blocks lie in `ro`'s causal past — the `ratifies` read. -/
