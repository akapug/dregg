# Dregg2.Substrate.VerbCompression — the VERB-COMPRESSION verdict: the kernel under the
universal map (the rotation question, investigated and PROVED both ways).

THE QUESTION. `Substrate/VerbRegistry.lean` proves the eight survivor verbs minimal — but its
minimality theorem quantifies over `verbBehavior : Verb → Substance × Polarity`, i.e. over
TODAY'S flat ontology (one structural rule per substance). The universal-map rotation
(REFINEMENT-DESIGN Decision 1 + task #165: caps / nullifiers / heap as collections of ONE
sorted-map family, `Substrate/Heap.lean`) re-houses every substance as a COLLECTION of that one
family. Under that ontology, is 8 still minimal — or do grant / revoke / lifecycle /
shield-unshield collapse into GUARDED WRITES to distinguished collections?

## THE VERDICT (every clause below is a theorem in this file)

The honest answer is BOTH, with the boundary exactly where the proof obligations live:

  * **lifecycle COMPRESSES into the landed caveat class.** The seal/unseal/destroy automaton is
    a guarded write whose guard reads only `(old value at the written key, new value)` —
    `lifecycle_compresses_local` puts `lifeGuard` in `LocalGuard`, the `SlotCaveat.eval actor
    old new` class `stateStepGuarded` already enforces. The one-way teeth survive verbatim:
    `life_reseal_refused`, `life_destroyed_terminal`.
  * **revoke COMPRESSES into the same class.** Narrowing (`new ⊆ old`) is a local guard
    (`revoke_compresses_local`); a committed narrow write provably narrows
    (`narrow_committed_narrows`), widening is refused (`demo_widen_refused`), and removal
    (`held \ drop`) always passes (`revoke_removal_admitted`). The delegation-epoch bump is the
    `new = old + 1` local guard — the existing MonotonicSequence caveat shape.
  * **unshield COMPRESSES — but ONLY past a PROVEN guard-algebra extension.** The double-spend
    gate is the freshness guard `(get m nf).isNone`, which is EXACTLY the absence atom
    (`fresh_is_absence_atom`) — and `freshness_not_positive` PROVES no conjunction of the landed
    POSITIVE atoms (`HeapKernel.HeapAtom` = `heapContains`/`heapGetEq`, the deployed `.all`
    shape) expresses it. The absence atom's semantic floor is already in-tree: the proven
    non-membership opening (`Heap.get_none_of_gap`). Anti-double-spend survives compression:
    `fresh_write_no_replay`. Shield is the same fresh write on the commitment collection, and
    evidence-monotonicity survives: `fresh_write_grows`.
  * **grant COMPRESSES — but ONLY past a SECOND, strictly stronger extension.** Non-amplification
    ("granted ⊆ some held authority of the delegator") is a guard that compares the WRITTEN value
    against the pre-state opening of ANOTHER key. `grant_guard_not_local` proves it is outside
    the local class; `grant_guard_not_literal` proves it is outside ALL conjunctions of literal
    atoms (contains / absent / getEq — even WITH the absence extension). It IS a guarded write
    under the order-relational guard `grantGuard` (`new ⊆ get(delegatorKey)`), and the guard IS
    the guarantee: `grant_non_amplifying`; an amplifying grant is refused
    (`demo_amplify_refused`); the real `Exec.attenuate` always passes (`attenuate_passes_guard`).
  * **move SEPARATES — conservation is NOT a guard, in ANY guard class.**
    `gwrite_conservation_trivializes` proves: for EVERY guard (arbitrary decidable predicate of
    the whole pre-state, actor, key, value — the maximal class), a committed single-key write
    that preserves the collection total writes the value already there. So a conservation-
    respecting guarded write can never debit or credit (`demo_debit_breaks_conservation`), and
    the genuine two-key move (`moveStep`, which conserves: `move_conserves`) is NOT any guarded
    write (`move_not_single_write` — it changes two openings, a guarded write changes at most
    one, `gwStep_changes_at_most_one`). Conservation lives in the ARITY (the paired cancelling
    deltas), not in the guard algebra.
  * **create SEPARATES by the same arity argument.** Its existence facet is the SAME absence-
    guarded fresh write as unshield (`fresh_write_no_replay` = no-rebirth), but bundle birth
    initializes several addresses atomically — not one guarded write
    (`create_birth_not_single_write`). (Its authority polarity — no prior holder — also inverts
    the write gate, per `verbBehavior .create = (.birth, .introduce)`.)
  * **exercise was NEVER a verb** — `exercise_already_structure` re-pins
    `VerbRegistry.classify .ExerciseViaCapability = .turnStructure .exercise`.

## What this means

The kernel under the universal map is **create · guarded-write · move** (3 verbs;
`compressed_kernel_three`), with exercise staying turn-structure. FIVE of the seven verb
constructors (write, grant, revoke, shieldUnshield, lifecycle) are ONE verb — so the 8-verb
minimality is an ARTIFACT of the flat ontology (`verb_minimality_is_ontology_relative`: distinct
verbs share a compressed fate). BUT the verb distinctions do NOT evaporate — they survive as a
PROVEN-STRICT stratification of the guard algebra:

      local (actor, old, new)  ──  the SlotCaveat class      : write, lifecycle, revoke
      + literal atoms          ──  the landed HeapAtom class : heap-write
      + the absence atom       ──  proven non-membership     : unshield, shield, create-legs
      + order-relational atoms ──  `new ⊆ get(k)`            : grant (non-amplification)

with each extension PROVEN proper (`freshness_not_positive`, `grant_guard_not_literal`) and
conservation PROVEN outside the whole tower (`gwrite_conservation_trivializes`). The honest
counter-argument was right about WHERE the obligations live, wrong about what they protect:
grant's authority algebra and unshield's freshness are GUARD-CLASS obligations (they ride the
rotation as guard-algebra extensions); move's conservation is a SHAPE obligation (it keeps its
own verb).

## Scope & provenance

NEW file; self-contained over `Substrate.Heap`'s proven sorted-map machinery (`get`/`set`/
frames), `Exec.Caps`'s REAL rights lattice (`ExecAuth = Finset Auth`, the genuine `⊆` order
`attenuate_subset` narrows along), and `Substrate.VerbRegistry`'s reified verb roster. The
separation theorems are stated against atom CONJUNCTIONS — the deployed guard shape
(`caveatsAdmit` / `heapAtomsAdmit` are both `.all`). The executor-state bridge (interpreting
`RecordKernelState` itself into the one map) rides THE ONE ROTATION; this module settles the
guard-class mathematics that rotation decision needs. Every theorem `#assert_axioms`-pinned.

The candidate compressed kernel's workhorse. State = collections of ONE sorted-map family
(`Substrate.Heap §1`, keys `ℤ` — the deployed key-hash address space); the verb = `gwStep`:

/-! ## §1 — the GUARD CLASSES (the deployed guard algebra, reified).

The compression question is only non-vacuous relative to a guard CLASS — with arbitrary guards
every verb "compresses" trivially (the guard can encode the whole step). The deployed classes:

  * `LocalGuard` — guards reading only `(actor, old value at the written key, new value)`: the
    `SlotCaveat.eval actor old new` class `EffectsState.caveatsAdmit` enforces today.
  * `LitAtom` conjunctions — guards built from per-key LITERAL atoms, evaluated fail-closed as a
    conjunction (`.all`): `contains`/`getEq` are EXACTLY the landed `HeapKernel.HeapAtom`
    algebra; `absent` is the extension the unshield compression needs (its semantic floor = the
    proven non-membership opening `Heap.get_none_of_gap`).
  * order-relational guards — `new ⊆ get(k)` for a key `k` chosen by the instance (§4's
    `grantGuard`): the rights ORDER enters the guard language. Proven strictly beyond both
    classes above. -/

/-- **The local guard class** — the `SlotCaveat` shape: the guard factors through
`(actor, the written key's pre-opening, the written value)`. -/
def LocalGuard {ν : Type} (g : UGuard ν) : Prop :=
  ∃ p : ℤ → Option ν → ν → Bool, ∀ m actor key new, g m actor key new = p actor (Heap.get m key) new

/-- **The literal atoms** — per-key membership/value tests, the `HeapAtom` shape plus the
absence extension. `contains`/`getEq` mirror `HeapKernel.HeapAtom.heapContains`/`heapGetEq`
LITERALLY; `absent` is the non-membership atom (NOT yet in the landed algebra — that gap is the
point of `freshness_not_positive`). -/
inductive LitAtom (ν : Type) where
  /-- the key is present (the landed `heapContains`). -/
  | contains (k : ℤ)
  /-- the key is ABSENT (the non-membership atom — the proposed extension). -/
  | absent (k : ℤ)
  /-- the key holds exactly `v` (the landed `heapGetEq`). -/

/-! ## §2 — LIFECYCLE COMPRESSES (into the landed local class, teeth intact).

The seal/unseal/destroy automaton (`RecordKernelState.lifecycle` discriminants: 0 = Live,
1 = Sealed, 3 = Destroyed; `EffectsState.sealStep`'s one-way gate) is a guarded write to the
lifecycle collection whose guard reads ONLY the written key's old discriminant and the new one —
the `SlotCaveat.eval actor old new` class, EXACTLY. Nothing beyond the landed guard algebra is
needed: lifecycle was a guarded write all along. -/

/-- The lifecycle automaton's edge relation, as a guard kernel: Live→Sealed (seal),
Sealed→Live (unseal), {Live,Sealed}→Destroyed (destroy). Everything else — including EVERY edge

/-! ## §3 — REVOKE COMPRESSES (narrowing is a local guard over the REAL rights lattice).

The revocation family edits the capability collection by NARROWING: `recKRevokeTarget` filters a
slot (`new = old.filter …`), attenuation keeps a subset, the delegation-epoch bump is
`new = old + 1` (the MonotonicSequence caveat shape, already landed). Over the universal map the

/-! ## §4 — GRANT: the SEPARATION (literal atoms cannot say "non-amplifying") and the
COMPRESSION (the order-relational guard, which IS non-amplification).

Grant writes rights to the RECIPIENT's edge address, but its guard — the constructive-knowledge
non-amplification `granted ⊆ heldBy(delegator)` (`recKDelegateAtten`'s gate,
`cell/src/capability.rs:461` `is_attenuation`) — reads a DIFFERENT key than it writes, and
compares the WRITTEN VALUE against that opening under the rights ORDER. Both features are proven
essential: the guard is outside the local class (§4.2) and outside every literal-atom
conjunction even WITH the absence extension (§4.3). So grant compresses only by admitting the
order-comparison atom into the guard algebra — the verb's proof obligation survives as a
guard-CLASS obligation. -/

/-- **The grant guard** — the order-relational non-amplification gate: admit writing rights
`new` (to any key — the recipient's edge) iff `new ⊆ ` the rights at the DELEGATOR's address

/-! ## §7 — CREATE: the legs compress (the SAME absence guard as unshield), the bundle does not.

Birth's existence facet over the universal map is a FRESH insert — `gwStep freshGuard`, with
no-rebirth = `fresh_write_no_replay` and domain growth = `fresh_write_grows`, ALREADY proven in
§5 (the pleasing identity: birth and note-spend ride the same non-membership opening). What does
NOT compress is the BUNDLE: minting a cell initializes several addresses (existence + lifecycle
+ balance + …) in one atomic step, and a guarded write changes at most one opening — the same
arity argument as move (without move's stronger leg-wise impossibility: create's individual legs
are each fine). Plus the polarity residue: create is the one verb whose write gate must NOT
demand held authority over the target (nothing holds an unborn cell) —
`VerbRegistry.verbBehavior .create = (.birth, .introduce)`. -/

/-- **CREATE'S ATOMICITY SEPARATION.** Birth initializing two addresses (existence ↦ 1,
lifecycle ↦ Live) from the empty state is NOT any single guarded write — same arity tooth as
move. -/

/-! ## §8 — THE VERDICT, REIFIED: the kernel under the universal map.

Each `VerbRegistry.Verb` gets its proven FATE: stays primitive, or dissolves into the one
guarded-write verb at a named guard class. The compressed kernel is `create · gwrite · move`
(`compressed_kernel_three`); the 8-verb minimality is ontology-relative
(`verb_minimality_is_ontology_relative`); the guard classes keep the dissolved verbs' proof
obligations alive (`grant` ≠ `revoke` in fate — `guard_class_distinguishes_grant_revoke`). -/

/-- The guard class a dissolved verb's interpretation PROVABLY needs (weakest sufficient,
per this module's theorems). -/
inductive GuardClass where
  /-- `(actor, old, new)` predicates — the landed `SlotCaveat` class. -/
  | localOldNew
  /-- conjunctions of `contains`/`getEq` literal atoms — the landed `HeapAtom` class. -/
  | literalAtoms
  /-- literal atoms + the ABSENCE atom (floor: the proven non-membership opening). -/
  | withAbsence
  /-- order-relational guards comparing the written value to another key's opening
      (`new ⊆ get(k)` — the rights lattice enters the guard language). -/
  | withOrderGuard
  deriving DecidableEq, BEq, Repr

/-- The compressed kernel's verbs. -/
inductive CVerb where
  /-- atomic multi-address bundle birth (separated by arity, `create_birth_not_single_write`). -/
  | create
  /-- THE guarded write (`gwStep` — five of the seven constructors dissolve into it). -/
  | gwrite
  /-- the paired Σδ = 0 exchange (separated by `gwrite_conservation_trivializes` +
      `move_not_single_write`). -/
  | move
  deriving DecidableEq, BEq, Repr

/-- A survivor verb's fate under the universal map. -/

  /-- the verb survives compression as its own primitive. -/

/-- **THE FATE TABLE** — each entry backed by this module's theorems:
`create` → primitive (`create_birth_not_single_write`); `write` → the guarded write at the
landed atom class (it IS the verb, `HeapKernel.heapStepGuarded`); `move` → primitive
(`move_not_single_write`, `gwrite_conservation_trivializes`); `grant` → guarded write at the
order class (`grant_non_amplifying`; necessity: `grant_guard_not_literal`,
`grant_guard_not_local`); `revoke` → guarded write, local (`revoke_compresses_local`,
`narrow_committed_narrows`); `shieldUnshield` → guarded write with absence
(`fresh_is_absence_atom`; necessity: `freshness_not_positive`); `lifecycle` → guarded write,
local (`lifecycle_compresses_local`, teeth `life_reseal_refused`/`life_destroyed_terminal`). -/

fate (a local guarded write). The old injectivity does not survive the re-ontologization — what
survives is the guard-class stratification. -/

provably distinct from revoke's — the authority verbs' asymmetry (production needs the order
guard, narrowing is local) is carried by the guard classes. -/
