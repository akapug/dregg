# Dregg2.Resource.TokenAutonomy — why an idempotent resource forces its OWN token.

`Resource.lean` internalizes conservation as a **frame-preserving update** on a
resource algebra (the camera), with `conservation_is_fpu` the canonical metatheorem.
A protocol's *token* is the OBJECT-LEVEL reflection of that conservation law: the
carrier of the conserved quantity. This module asks the dual, design-level question —

  **when can a protocol borrow a FOREIGN token (ADA, ℤ-money) to carry its resource,
  and when must it mint its OWN?**

The answer is a one-line piece of monoid algebra with real teeth. Frame the resource
as a commutative monoid `(M, *, 1)`. A *sound foreign substitution* of `P` by `F` is a
**retract in `CommMonoid`**: a homomorphic embedding `embed : P →* F` that some
homomorphic `read : F →* P` inverts (`read (embed p) = p`) — `F` faithfully carries
every `P`-resource and reads it back with NO loss of `P`-information. (Retract = "`F`
can stand in for `P` losslessly", the precise sense in which one token substitutes for
another.)

THE OBSTRUCTION. In a **cancellative** monoid the ONLY idempotent is the unit
(`a * a = a → a = 1`, by cancelling `a`). Money is cancellative: `x + a = x + b → a = b`
(ℤ, ADA). So a cancellative `F` has no non-trivial idempotent. But a **set/lattice**
resource — privacy commitments, nullifiers, the capability lattice, any `Finset` under
`∪` — DOES: a nonempty set `s` has `s ∪ s = s` with `s ≠ ∅`. "Have-it-twice =
have-it-once" is idempotence; it is the algebraic signature of *authority/membership*,
the opposite of a *quantity*. A retract would push `P`'s idempotent `a` to an idempotent
of `F` (homs preserve `a*a=a`), which in cancellative `F` is forced to `1`, and then
`read` pulls it back to `1 ≠ a` — contradicting `retract`. So:

  **`no_substitution_of_idempotent`** — a protocol whose conserved resource has a
  NON-TRIVIAL idempotent admits NO sound substitution by a cancellative (ℤ-like) token.
  Such a protocol MUST instantiate its own resource algebra — its own token.

This is exactly an autonomy theorem for dregg2's set-valued resources: the
capability lattice (`Exec/Positional.lean` `Auth` + `Finset Auth`), the nullifier and
commitment SETs (`Exec/RecordKernel.lean`), the CRDT `GSet` (`Confluence/CRDT.lean`) —
all `Finset`-under-`∪` idempotent monoids — are NOT ADA-substitutable. An idempotent
(non-numeric) resource forces an autonomous (non-numeric) token. See
`Resource.conservation_is_fpu`: the token is the object-level reflection of that
conservation metatheorem, and its *algebra* (cancellative vs idempotent) is what decides
substitutability.

THE HONEST OTHER SIDE (`degenerate_payment_substitutes`). When `P` itself is
cancellative — pure ℤ payment — it DOES retract into ℤ (identity). The cryptobro is
*right for money*: a payment protocol can ride ADA. The theorem is a *discriminator*,
not a blanket "always mint your own": it cleanly separates payment (cancellative,
substitutable) from privacy/authority (idempotent, autonomous).

/-! ## §1. Sound foreign substitution = a retract in `CommMonoid`.

`F` can stand in for `P` losslessly: a hom embeds, a hom reads, the read inverts the
embed. This is the precise structure a "use ADA instead of your own token" claim asserts. -/

/-- **A sound foreign substitution of `P` by `F`** — a retract of commutative monoids.
`embed` homomorphically carries each `P`-resource into `F`; `read` homomorphically
recovers it; `retract` says NO `P`-information is lost (`read ∘ embed = id`). This is the
honest formalization of "the foreign token `F` can carry protocol `P`'s resource". -/

/-! ## §2. The obstruction — a cancellative monoid has no non-trivial idempotent.

The single fact with teeth. It GENUINELY cancels `a` (`mul_left_cancel`), so it is the
load-bearing use of the cancellative hypothesis. -/

/-- **In a cancellative commutative monoid the only idempotent is the unit.**
From `a * a = a = a * 1`, cancel `a` on the left to get `a = 1`. This is the algebraic
heart: cancellativity (the ℤ/ADA property `x*a = x*b → a = b`) is exactly what forbids a
non-trivial "have-it-twice = have-it-once". -/

/-- **`no_substitution_of_idempotent` (THE KEYSTONE).** If `P`'s resource has a
NON-TRIVIAL idempotent `a` (`a * a = a`, `a ≠ 1`) and the foreign token `F` is
cancellative (ℤ-like), then there is NO sound substitution of `P` by `F`.

Proof: a substitution would push `a` to `embed a`, an idempotent of `F` (homs preserve
idempotence), which cancellativity forces to be `1`. Then `read` of that is `read 1 = 1`,
yet `retract` says `read (embed a) = a`. So `a = 1`, contradicting `a ≠ 1`. The protocol
literally cannot retract its set-valued resource into a numeric token. -/

/-! ## §4. THE WITNESSES — landing on dregg2's REAL set-valued resources.

The dregg2 capability lattice / nullifier set / commitment set / CRDT `GSet` are all
`Finset` under `∪` with unit `∅`. We give that the `CommMonoid` structure (this is the
idempotent monoid the whole metatheory's set-resources share) and exhibit a non-trivial
idempotent. We use `Multiplicative ℤ` as the cancellative `F` (ℤ-money, ADA). -/

/-- **The grow-only / set resource `GSet α`** — a `Finset α` whose monoid operation is
`∪` with unit `∅`. This is the dregg2 capability lattice (`Finset Auth`), the nullifier
SET, the commitment SET, the CRDT `GSet` — ONE idempotent monoid. We wrap it in a
structure so the monoid operation is `∪` (not the default `Finset` product) without
clashing with any ambient instance. -/

/-! ### The cancellative foreign token: `Multiplicative ℤ` (ℤ-money, ADA). -/

commutative monoid. This is the algebraic shape of ADA / any ℤ-valued payment token. -/

/-- **THE WITNESS THEOREM. The dregg2 capability/nullifier/commitment SET token is NOT
ADA-substitutable.** With `P = GSet α` (the dregg2 set-resource) and `F = Multiplicative ℤ`
(ADA), the non-trivial idempotent `{a}` blocks every sound substitution. Concretely: a
protocol whose conserved resource is a membership SET cannot ride a numeric/ℤ token. -/

/-! ## §5. THE HONEST DEGENERATE COROLLARY — cancellative payment DOES substitute.

The discriminator's other arm: a cancellative `P` (pure ℤ payment) retracts into itself.
The cryptobro is *right for money* — a payment protocol can ride a foreign ℤ token. The
substitution exists (the identity retract); the theorem only forbids it for idempotent
(set/authority) resources. -/

read = id). The constructive content of "a cancellative payment token rides a foreign
copy of itself" — and concretely instantiated below for ℤ-money. -/

  embed := MonoidHom.id P
  read := MonoidHom.id P
  retract := fun _ => rfl

/-- **`degenerate_payment_substitutes` (THE HONEST OTHER SIDE).** Pure ℤ payment —
`F = Multiplicative ℤ`, a cancellative token — DOES admit a sound substitution (into a
foreign copy of itself, the identity retract). So the theorem is a *discriminator*: it
distinguishes idempotent privacy/authority resources (no substitution) from cancellative
payment (substitution exists). The cryptobro is right for money. -/
theorem degenerate_payment_substitutes :
    Nonempty (SoundSubstitution (Multiplicative ℤ) (Multiplicative ℤ)) :=
  ⟨SoundSubstitution.id _⟩

/-- Sharper: the substitution holds for ANY cancellative `P` into itself — payment of any
ℤ-like flavor rides a foreign copy of its own token. This is the precise dual to
`no_substitution_of_idempotent`: there the idempotent BLOCKED it; here cancellativity
poses NO obstruction (the identity retract always works). -/
theorem cancellative_self_substitutes (P : Type u) [CommMonoid P] [IsCancelMul P] :
    Nonempty (SoundSubstitution P P) :=

/-! ## §6. Internalization note (cite `Resource.conservation_is_fpu`).

`conservation_is_fpu` shows conservation IS a frame-preserving update on the resource
algebra. A protocol's *token* is the carrier of that conserved quantity — the
object-level reflection of the conservation law. This module proves a structural fact
about that reflection: the token's *algebra* decides substitutability.

  * cancellative carrier (ℤ, ADA)  ⇒  numeric quantity  ⇒  borrowable (degenerate §5).
  * idempotent carrier (Finset ∪)  ⇒  membership/authority ⇒  AUTONOMOUS (keystone §3).

An idempotent ("have-it-twice = have-it-once") resource forces an autonomous (non-numeric)
token — the protocol MUST instantiate its OWN resource algebra. We record the link to the
camera tier explicitly. -/

/-- **The bridge to the camera tier.** A `GSet` is a `Dregg2.Resource` camera element via
the always-valid, idempotent-core resource-algebra over the underlying `Finset` join —
the same idempotent monoid `conservation_is_fpu` conserves. We record the witness that the
metatheory's conserved set-resource is precisely the idempotent monoid §3 forbids ℤ from
carrying. (Stated as a `Prop` carrier reusing the §4 idempotent fact, so the citation is
machine-checked, not prose.) -/
