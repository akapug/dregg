# Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientMpt — EVM state-inclusion (EIP-1186) verification RULES, PROVEN.

The per-chain lane for **EVM state inclusion**: the rules by which a light client, holding a
finality-verified execution `state_root`, checks an `eth_getProof` (EIP-1186) proof chain that
a holder holds `balance` of an ERC-20 `token` — formalized in Lean over
`Dregg2.Bridge.VerifiedLightClient`, with the three obligations (`NoForgery` / `FailClosed` /
`NonVacuous`) DISCHARGED, plus the binding theorem the Merkle-Patricia structure exists to
provide: under one state root, one holder has ONE provable balance (`mpt_balance_binding`) —
forging a second balance is a keccak collision.

THE RULES FORMALIZED (the Rust spec is `eth-lightclient/src/evm.rs`, `verify_erc20_holding`):

  1. **Account (state) trie** (`evm.rs:158-180`): `state_root --MPT--> keccak256(token) →
     account(nonce, balance, storageHash, codeHash)`. The account leaf binds ALL FOUR fields at
     once — in particular `storageHash`, the root of the contract's own storage trie.
  2. **Storage trie** (`evm.rs:182-197`): `storageHash --MPT--> keccak256(slot_key) →
     balance`, where `slot_key = keccak256(pad32(holder) ‖ pad32(balances_slot))`
     (`erc20_balance_slot_key`, `evm.rs:117-124`) — the Solidity `mapping(address ⇒ uint256)`
     slot for `balances[holder]`.
  3. **Nomad-law floor** (`evm.rs:154-156`): a zero claimed balance is REFUSED even when its
     proof verifies — a trivial/empty holding never mints a proven holding.

TWO LAYERS, kept honest:

  * RULES (this file, proven): the two-tier path walk, the hash-derived keys, the account→
    storageHash binding, the exact-value check, the zero floor, fail-closed on everything else.
  * CRYPTO (ONE leaf): **keccak256 collision resistance as a CARRIER** — the foundation's
    `CryptoLeaf.hashCR : Prop` (the named CR floor: MPT node hashing is keccak256) plus
    `noCollision : hashCR → (hash m₁ = hash m₂ → m₁ = m₂)`, mirroring
    `Dregg2.Crypto.PortalFloor.Blake3Kernel` (`Crypto/PortalFloor.lean:178-185`). NOT
    unconditional injectivity — that is pigeonhole-FALSE for the real compressing keccak256
    (collisions exist); injectivity here holds only RELATIVE to the carrier. There is NO
    signature in this client (the `state_root`'s finality is the UPSTREAM sync-committee
    client's job; this lane's `CryptoLeaf.sigVerify` is the constant-`false` verifier, so its
    `sigSound` is vacuously proven and carries nothing). Every general theorem below takes the
    hash `H` and (where binding is needed) the unpacked CR fact `hCR` — exactly what
    `leaf.noCollision hcr` yields GIVEN the carrier — as EXPLICIT hypotheses: the assumption is
    visible at every use site, never a global axiom, never a laundered `def`. The shipped
    instance's carrier is the genuine CR `Prop` over `toyKeccak` (an injective model hash), so
    the carrier is PROVED (`mptLeaf_hashCR`) and this file is genuinely axiom-clean; the
    collapsing keccak FALSIFIES the same carrier shape (`mptCollapseLeaf_not_hashCR` — both
    polarities witnessed). A production instance swaps in EverCrypt-realized keccak256 with the
    carrier discharged by its single named keccak256-CR library assumption, and ALL the
    theorems here apply unchanged.

MODELING FIDELITY (stated, not hidden): bytes are `Nat`s and byte-strings `List Nat`; the RLP
node/account encodings are modeled by `encodeNode`/`encAccount`, whose INJECTIVITY — RLP's
canonical-decodability, a rules-level fact — is PROVEN here (`encodeNode_injective`,
`encAccount_injective`), not assumed. The nibble path is a fixed 4-nibble unpack of the key
digest (`nibbles`) standing in for the 64-nibble `Nibbles::unpack(keccak256(·))`; MPT extension
nodes (pure path compression) are absorbed into leaf `keySuffix`. None of these shortenings
touches the load-bearing structure: hash-linked path steps, hash-derived keys, two-tier
storageHash binding, exact terminal value.

NON-VACUITY (the Nomad-law tooth, all under the SAME trusted state): the gate ACCEPTS the
genuine holding and REJECTS a forged balance, a tampered storage node, a wrong contract, a
foreign-path account proof, and an absent key (`mpt_gate_discriminates`); a ZERO holding whose
MPT proof genuinely verifies is still refused (`mpt_zero_balance_refused` — the floor does its
own work); the empty update is rejected for every trusted state (`mpt_failClosed`).

Kernel-clean: `#assert_axioms` hard-gates every theorem (only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/
`Quot.sound`).

/-! ## §1 — The Merkle-Patricia trie model: nodes, injective encoding, path walk.

A node is a LEAF (remaining key nibbles + terminal value) or a BRANCH (children digests
indexed by nibble; `none` = absent child — the exclusion side). `encodeNode` models the RLP
node encoding; its injectivity is the canonical-decodability fact RLP provides, PROVEN here so
the only crypto assumption left is keccak collision resistance. -/

/-- An MPT node: `leaf keySuffix value` (terminal; extension nodes are absorbed as compressed
suffix) or `branch children` (per-nibble child digests; `none` = no child at that nibble). -/

  | _ => none

/-- **The Prop-level trie DENOTATION** — what "value `v` is genuinely committed at path `p`
under digest `d`" MEANS, independent of any supplied proof: there is a hash-linked node
structure from `d` down to a leaf carrying exactly `v` with exactly the remaining path. This
is the `ForeignValid` backbone; `NoForgery` lands accepted updates HERE. -/
inductive Commits (H : List Nat → Nat) : Nat → List Nat → List Nat → Prop where

      (hc : childAt cs i = some d) (child : Commits H d rest v) :
      Commits H (H (encodeNode (.branch cs))) (i :: rest) v

/-- **THE EXECUTABLE PATH WALK** — the MPT verification rules (`alloy_trie::verify_proof`'s
job in `evm.rs:174/191`): walk the supplied nodes root-down; each node must hash to the digest
its parent (or the root) committed; a branch consumes one nibble through a PRESENT child; a
leaf must carry exactly the remaining path and exactly the expected value, with no trailing
proof junk. Everything else: `false`. -/

  | _, _, _, [] => false

      (match childAt cs i with
       | some d => verifyPath H d p value rest
       | none => false)
  | _, [], _, .branch _ :: _ => false

/-- **Path-walk SOUNDNESS.** An accepted walk lands in the denotation: the value is genuinely
committed under the root. (No crypto needed — each check literally establishes its hash link;
CR is what makes the denotation BINDING, below.) -/
theorem verifyPath_sound (H : List Nat → Nat) :
    ∀ (nodes : List MptNode) (root : Nat) (path value : List Nat),
      verifyPath H root path value nodes = true → Commits H root path value := by
  intro nodes
  induction nodes with
  | nil => intro root path value h; simp [verifyPath] at h
  | cons n rest ih =>

      obtain ⟨⟨⟨-, hroot⟩, hk⟩, hv⟩ := h
      subst hroot; subst hk; subst hv
      exact Commits.leaf k v
    | branch cs =>
      cases path with
      | nil => simp [verifyPath] at h
      | cons i p =>
        simp only [verifyPath, Bool.and_eq_true, beq_iff_eq] at h
        obtain ⟨hroot, hstep⟩ := h
        subst hroot
        cases hd : childAt cs i with
        | none => rw [hd] at hstep; simp at hstep
        | some d =>
          rw [hd] at hstep
          exact Commits.branch cs i d p value hd (ih d p value hstep)

/-! ## §2 — THE BINDING THEOREM (where keccak collision resistance is LOAD-BEARING).

Soundness says an accepted value is committed; BINDING says the root commits at most ONE value
per path — so a tampered node presenting a different value at the same slot requires a hash
collision. `hCR` is consumed at every level of the induction. This is the theorem the Merkle
structure exists to provide. -/

/-- **`commits_binding`** — one digest, one path, ONE value. The proof walks both derivations
together: equal digests + `hCR` ⇒ equal encodings ⇒ (`encodeNode_injective`) equal nodes ⇒
recurse into the equal child. Forging a second value at a committed slot IS a keccak collision. -/
theorem commits_binding (H : List Nat → Nat)

/-- The Solidity mapping-slot preimage, `pad32(holder) ‖ pad32(balances_slot)`
(`erc20_balance_slot_key`, `evm.rs:117-124`): two fixed-width fields, modeled as the
fixed-arity list. -/

DERIVED BY HASHING the contract address — a proof for another contract walks another path. -/

/-- STORAGE-trie path: `Nibbles.unpack(keccak256(slot_key))` with `slot_key =

def storagePath (H : List Nat → Nat) (holder mappingSlot : Nat) : List Nat :=
  nibbles (H [H (slotKeyPreimage holder mappingSlot)])

/-- **TrustedState** — what the consumer already verified/configured: the finality-verified
execution `state_root` (from the sync-committee client, `evm.rs:127-133`), the watched ERC-20
contract, and its declared `balances` mapping slot. -/
structure MptState where

/-- **Update** — one claimed EIP-1186 holding: the anchor it opens against (checked against

/-- **THE RULES** (`verify_erc20_holding`, `evm.rs:142-206`): zero floor first; the update's
carried anchor/contract/slot must equal the TRUSTED ones; the account proof must open
`keccak(token)` to the claimed account under the state root; the storage proof must open the
holder's derived slot to the claimed balance under that account's OWN `storageHash`. Any
failing leg refuses (fail closed). -/

/-- **ForeignValid** — the chain's OWN validity notion for a claimed holding, stated in the
DENOTATION (no proof chains mentioned): the balance is nonzero, the claimed account is
genuinely committed at the token's hashed key under the carried state root, the claimed
balance is genuinely committed at the holder's derived slot under that account's storageHash,
AND the slot BINDS — no other balance is committed at that slot. "A proven balance is THE
balance committed under the state root at the right contract/slot." The binding conjunct is
exactly what the keccak-CR carrier buys (`commits_binding`); it is where `noCollision hcr` is
consumed in `mpt_noForgery` — the CR hypothesis is load-bearing, not decorative. -/

/-! ## §4 — The three obligations, DISCHARGED (parametric in the hash, so a real keccak
instance reuses these proofs verbatim). -/

/-- **NO FORGERY — GIVEN the CR floor.** `mptVerify` accepts ⟹ the holding is genuinely
committed AND binding: both tiers land in the `Commits` denotation via `verifyPath_sound` (no
crypto needed — each check establishes its own hash link), the zero floor transfers, and the
slot-BINDING conjunct is discharged by `commits_binding`, CONSUMING `hCR` — the unpacked CR
carrier (`leaf.noCollision hcr`), the explicit hypothesis that replaced the old unconditional
injectivity. A chain whose hash collapses gets NO no-forgery guarantee: the honest shape. -/

/-- **NO FORGERY, ANCHORED.** Acceptance additionally pins the update's carried anchor to the
TRUSTED state: the committed-under root IS `ts.stateRoot`, the contract IS `ts.token`, the
slot IS `ts.mappingSlot` — the full "committed under the verified state root at the right
contract/slot" statement. -/

/-- **BALANCE BINDING — the keccak-CR theorem.** Under ONE trusted state, ONE holder has ONE
provable balance: two accepted updates for the same holder agree. The proof consumes `hCR`
through both tiers — account binding pins the account (hence `storageHash`,
`encAccount_injective`), then storage binding pins the balance. Forging a different balance
for a committed holder REQUIRES a keccak collision. This is the honest form of the crypto
leaf: `hCR` is the UNPACKED CR CARRIER — a per-chain instance supplies it as
`leaf.noCollision hcr` given `hcr : leaf.hashCR`, the named keccak256-CR floor assumption
(see `mptLeaf_balance_binding` below), NEVER as unconditional injectivity. -/

/-- **The `CryptoLeaf` for this lane** — keccak CR is the ONLY live crypto assumption. The
signature slot is the constant-`false` verifier (an EVM inclusion proof carries NO signature;
finality of the state root is the upstream sync-committee client's leaf), so `sigSound` is
vacuously proven and can carry nothing. The `hashCR` CARRIER is the genuine CR `Prop` over
THIS leaf's own hash (the `PortalFloor.Reference` pattern) — NOT `True`; it is dischargeable

keccak collision); a wrong contract (token 3) is REJECTED; a wrong holder (4) is REJECTED —
its derived slot key walks to an ABSENT branch child (the exclusion side). -/

theorems; the leaf is `mptLeaf` (the keccak-CR CARRIER the only live assumption, PROVEN for
the model hash). The `noForgery` field has the foundation's shape `leaf.hashCR → NoForgery …`:
it UNPACKS the carrier — `mptLeaf.noCollision hcr` — and feeds it to `mpt_noForgery` exactly
where the old unconditional injectivity used to sit. A production instance changes exactly one
thing: the hash + the named CR discharge of its carrier. -/

/-- **Balance binding, at the leaf (the carrier route, showcased).** The §4 binding theorem
consumed `hCR` as a hypothesis; HERE is where a bundled instance discharges it: given the
carrier `hcr : mptLeaf.hashCR` (proved for the model leaf by `mptLeaf_hashCR`; supplied as the
named keccak256-CR floor in production), `mptLeaf.noCollision hcr` yields the unpacked CR fact
and the two-tier binding follows. One trusted state, one holder, ONE balance — GIVEN the CR
floor, never unconditionally. -/

/-! ## §8 — Axiom hygiene: every theorem kernel-clean. The model leaf's CR CARRIER is PROVED
(`mptLeaf_hashCR`, via `toyKeccak_injective`), so nothing here rests on an unproven crypto
assumption; a production instance's `noForgery`/`binding` would rest on its VISIBLE, NAMED
keccak256-CR discharge of the carrier — a structure field / theorem hypothesis is invisible to
`#assert_axioms` by design, which is why the carrier is an explicit `Prop` an auditor reads at
the instance site. The both-polarity pins (`mptLeaf_hashCR` / `mptCollapseLeaf_not_hashCR`)
prove the carrier is a real discriminating hypothesis, not `True` in disguise. -/
