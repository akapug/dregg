# Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientTendermint — the VERIFIED Cosmos/Tendermint light-client RULES.

dregg verifies a Cosmos chain by PROOF: this file formalizes the Tendermint light-client
header-acceptance rules — the logic of `cosmos-lightclient/src/lib.rs:173`
(`verify_cosmos_header`, the informalsystems `ProdVerifier` rule set the crate delegates to,
`lib.rs:159-166`) — in Lean over the shared `Dregg2.Bridge.VerifiedLightClient` foundation,
and proves the three obligations `NoForgery` / `FailClosed` / `NonVacuous`.

THE RULES formalized (each cites the Rust it is the spec of):

  * **chain-id match** — a header from another chain is refused (cross-chain replay defense,
    `lib.rs:78-80`).
  * **adjacent-height advance + validator-set-hash binding** — the untrusted header is
    `trusted.height + 1` and the trusted `next_validators_hash` equals the hash of the
    untrusted validator-set encoding (`lib.rs:73-75, 85-88, 163-165`): the set that signs is
    EXACTLY the set the trusted header committed to. The header also self-binds
    (`header.validatorsHash = hash(valset)`), so the quorum is over the set the header names.
  * **stake-weighted ≥ 2/3 commit** — strictly MORE than 2/3 of the validator set's total
    voting power signed the commit, each signature verified against the header's canonical
    sign-bytes (`lib.rs:14-15, 99-102, 160-162`; Tendermint's `voting_power_needed = 2/3` is
    strict `>`). A missing (`none`) or invalid signature contributes ZERO power.
  * **time window** — untrusted time strictly after the trusted header time (monotonic), not
    from the future beyond `now + clock_drift`, and the trusted header still inside the
    trusting period (`lib.rs:15-16, 92-93, 162-166`).

TWO LAYERS, kept honest:

  * The rules layer (§2-§4) is PARAMETRIC over an arbitrary `CryptoLeaf` — for the real chain
    that leaf is ed25519 signature soundness (`sigSound`: a verifying commit signature means
    the validator genuinely signed those vote bytes — Ed25519 EUF-CMA, discharged by a
    verified crypto library) and the SHA-256 collision-resistance CARRIER (`hashCR : Prop`
    + `noCollision` — the honest CR floor, NOT idealized injectivity, which is
    pigeonhole-false for a real compressing hash). Every theorem that pins the validator-set
    bytes takes `hcr : L.hashCR` as an EXPLICIT hypothesis and consumes `L.noCollision hcr`.
    `tmNoForgery` is therefore literally "IF ed25519 is sound AND SHA-256 is
    collision-resistant THEN an accepted header carries a genuine >2/3-stake commit of its
    committed validator set, and that set binding is UNIQUE" — the crypto assumptions are
    the `∀ L : CryptoLeaf` binder + the named `hcr` hypothesis, minimal and visible, never a
    laundered `def FooValid`.
  * The demo instance (§5-§7) PROVES its leaf INCLUDING the CR carrier (like the foundation's
    toy: `demoLeaf_hashCR`), and a collapsing demo hash FALSIFIES the same carrier shape
    (`demoCollapseLeaf_not_hashCR`) — both polarities witnessed, so the shipped file is
    genuinely axiom-clean end to end and the discriminators run on concrete data.

NON-VACUITY (the Nomad-law tooth, `tm_gate_discriminates`): under the SAME trusted state the
gate ACCEPTS a genuine 3-of-3 commit and REJECTS: an exactly-2/3 sub-quorum commit (Tendermint
requires strictly more), a forged third signature, a tampered `validatorsHash`, a self-consistent
update signed by a DIFFERENT validator set than the trusted epoch committed, a wrong chain-id,
a non-monotonic time, a future time, and the empty update.

ICS-23 membership (`verify_cosmos_membership`, `lib.rs:299`) is the named follow-up rung; here
its anchor appears as the adapter `inclusion` demo — an app-state fact is accepted only under a
verified header's `appHash` (`toAdapter` composition, §7).

Kernel-clean: `#assert_axioms` hard-gates every theorem; the only crypto assumptions are the
named `CryptoLeaf` fields, carried as VISIBLE hypotheses (`∀ L`), proven for the demo instance.

Heights and times are `Nat` (Tendermint's are u64 / nanosecond timestamps); pubkeys, signatures

digests straight in. The commit is positional (`List (Option Sig)`) exactly like Tendermint's
per-validator `CommitSig` array — `none` is `BlockIdFlagAbsent`. -/

/-! ## §4 — The three obligations, GENERIC in the crypto leaf.

`tmNoForgery` below is the honest theorem shape: `∀ L : CryptoLeaf, L.hashCR → …` —
instantiate `L` with the real ed25519+SHA-256 leaf (whose `sigSound` is the named
verified-library unforgeability assumption and whose `hashCR` CARRIER is the named SHA-256
collision-resistance assumption) and it reads: IF ed25519 is sound AND SHA-256 is
collision-resistant THEN an accepted header genuinely carries a >2/3-stake commit of its
committed validator set, and the 32-byte `validatorsHash` binds ONE set. The CR carrier is
consumed via `L.noCollision hcr` — never unconditional injectivity. -/

/-- **The foreign-chain validity predicate** — what Tendermint itself calls a valid header:
the header's `validatorsHash` really commits its validator set, that commitment BINDS (no
other set encoding hashes to the header's `validatorsHash` — the conjunct the CR carrier
buys via `noCollision`, mirroring the foundation's `toyForeignValid` binding leg), and there
is a sub-list of that set which GENUINELY signed the header's sign-bytes (the `Signed`
denotation, not a boolean) carrying strictly more than 2/3 of the total power. -/
def TmForeignValid (u : TmUpdate L) : Prop :=
  L.hash (enc u.validators) = u.header.validatorsHash
  ∧ (∀ vs' : List (TmValidator L.PubKey),
      L.hash (enc vs') = u.header.validatorsHash → enc vs' = enc u.validators)
  ∧ ∃ S : List (TmValidator L.PubKey),
      S.Sublist u.validators
      ∧ (∀ v ∈ S, L.Signed v.pubkey (sb u.header))
      ∧ 2 * totalPower u.validators < 3 * totalPower S

/-- **NO FORGERY.** GIVEN the SHA-256 CR carrier (`hcr : L.hashCR` — the named hash floor,
an explicit hypothesis), an update `tmVerify` accepts is foreign-valid: the genuine-signer
sub-list is `signers …`, its sublist-ness and power come from §2, its GENUINENESS comes from
the crypto leaf's `sigSound` (via `signers_signed`) — the ed25519 assumption consumed exactly
there — and the set-binding conjunct is discharged by `L.noCollision hcr` — the CR carrier
consumed exactly here, never assumed at the update level and never as unconditional
injectivity. A chain whose hash collapses gets NO no-forgery conclusion. -/

/-! ## §5 — The demo crypto leaf (the ed25519 + SHA-256 SLOT), proved like the foundation's toy.

A real deployment replaces this with the ed25519 leaf whose `sigSound` is the named
verified-library unforgeability assumption and the SHA-256 leaf whose `hashCR` CARRIER is the
named collision-resistance assumption (both VISIBLE at the instance site — a structure field
and a hypothesis are invisible to `#assert_axioms`, so they are documented here, not hidden).
The demo PROVES both: `sigSound` outright and the CR carrier standalone (`demoLeaf_hashCR` —
the `PortalFloor.Reference` pattern: the carrier is the genuine CR `Prop` over THIS leaf's own
hash, NOT `True`), keeping this file genuinely axiom-clean: registered keys are `pk < 100`,
the toy MAC is `s = pk + m`, the hash is the identity. A collapsing hash FALSIFIES the same
carrier shape (`demoCollapseLeaf_not_hashCR`) — both polarities witnessed. -/

/-! ## §7 — The bundle + the `InterchainAdapter` composition: the finality hypothesis DISCHARGED.

`tendermintClient` cannot exist without the three obligations — they are fields. `toAdapter`
then produces the adapter whose `foreignFinal` is the light client's decidable verdict on the
`proof` rung: the `foreignFinal` hypothesis `Metatheory.Bridge.InterchainAdapter` assumes is
PRODUCED, not assumed. The inclusion demo is the ICS-23 anchor: an app-state fact (an
`appHash`-committed value, `lib.rs:299` `verify_cosmos_membership`'s anchor) is accepted only
under a verified header. -/

/-- **The Tendermint `ForeignLightClient`** — all three obligations discharged over the real
rule set (§3-§4), instantiated at the demo leaf. `noForgery` has the foundation's honest
shape `leaf.hashCR → NoForgery …` — the CR carrier is the explicit hypothesis `tmNoForgery`
consumes. `nonVacuous` is witnessed by the genuine 3-of-3 update vs the exactly-2/3
sub-quorum update under the SAME trusted state. -/

outright and the CR CARRIER standalone (`demoLeaf_hashCR`) — so nothing here rests on an
unproven crypto assumption. A REAL deployment's `noForgery` rests on its VISIBLE, named
`leaf.sigSound` (ed25519) field and takes `leaf.hashCR` (the named SHA-256
collision-resistance floor) as its explicit CR hypothesis — a structure field and a
hypothesis, which `#assert_axioms` cannot see, hence declared in this header, not hidden.
The both-polarity pins (`demoLeaf_hashCR` / `demoCollapseLeaf_not_hashCR`) prove the carrier
is a real discriminating hypothesis, not `True` in disguise. -/
