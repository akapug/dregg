# Dregg2.Lightclient.NonOmissionAttack — REFUTE-AND-REPAIR the non-omission light-client guarantee.

`AttestedQuery.light_client_query_non_omission` and `MMR.light_client_position_non_omission` are
`#assert_axioms`-clean, but each consumes a HYPOTHESIS `hweld : CommitBindsIndex/CommitBindsMMR …
(ChainStep.newRoot …) …` — "the per-turn state commitment the IVC chain folds absorbs the
receipt-index/MMR root as a sponge limb". This module asks whether that obligation has an HONEST
discharge against the commit the deployed chain actually folds, then closes the gap.

## §1 — THE REPAIR, WELDED INTO THE AGGREGATION MODEL (the chain folds the rotated commit)

The aggregation model now folds `ChainStep.newRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s =
HistoryAggregation.chainedCommit … s.post s.turn = compressN [recStateCommit … s.post.kernel s.turn,
logRoot … s.post.log]` — the deployed rotated commit `hash_many [d, iroot]`. The kernel-digest LIMB `d
= recStateCommit … k t` is still blind to the receipt log (`recStateCommit k t = cmb (cellDigest … k t)
(RH k)`, and `RH` is injective on the sixteen NON-CELL kernel components — accounts · caps · bal ·
nullifiers · revoked · commitments · slotCaveats · factories · lifecycle · deathCert · delegate ·
delegations · delegationEpoch · delegationEpochAt · heaps — **the receipt log is NOT among them**); that
is precisely WHY the rotated commit absorbs the log as its SECOND limb:

  * `recStateCommit_admits_receipt_omission` — the kernel-digest limb ALONE is LITERALLY unchanged
    (`rfl`) when a receipt is dropped, while the receipt-log MMR roots DIFFER (`mroot_injective`). The
    residual a kernel-only chained commit would leave open.
  * `newRoot_binds_log` — the rotated `chainedCommit` CLOSES it: two steps sharing a turn whose
    `newRoot`s agree have EQUAL receipt logs (`HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_log`, the outer
    sponge peel + `logRoot_injective`). A dropped/forged/reordered receipt MOVES the published commit;
    the light client catches it. So `hweld` over the per-turn commitment is now DISCHARGED by the model.

## §2 — the ROOT FACE grounded (the single deployed commit)

The deployed Rust binds it: post-G4 the live chained commit is the ROTATED WIDE commitment
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs`, `B_IROOT = 37`, `state_commit = hash_many [d, iroot]`;
`turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:349` "iroot … absorbed INTO the v9 commitment, which the proof
binds"). The Lean twin is `RotationLayout.rotatedCommit`, whose `rotatedCommit_binds_mmr` discharges
`CommitBindsMMR` **by `rfl`**. So the grounded theorems chain the rotated commit and consume the
PROVEN binding — NO `hweld`:

## §2 — REPAIR (the guarantee made real-as-deployed)

The deployed Rust DOES bind it: post-G4 the live chained commit is the ROTATED WIDE commitment
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs`, `B_IROOT = 37`, `state_commit = hash_many [d, iroot]`;
`turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:349` "iroot … absorbed INTO the v9 commitment, which the proof
binds"). The Lean twin is `RotationLayout.rotatedCommit`, whose `rotatedCommit_binds_mmr` discharges
`CommitBindsMMR` **by `rfl`**. So the grounded theorems chain the rotated commit and consume the
PROVEN binding — NO `hweld`:

  * `light_client_position_non_omission_grounded` (MMR, the deployed dense receipt index) and
  * `light_client_query_non_omission_grounded` (the sorted-map index face),

each: a server opening of the DEPLOYED rotated commit, plus a verifying range answer, forces the
answer to be EXACTLY the genuine range — omission impossible, forgery impossible — resting on the
`rfl` binding alone. Non-vacuity §3: the honest opening FIRES (returns the complete range) and an
omitting answer is REJECTED (would force `[333] = [222,333]`, absurd).

## §3/§4 — the residual CLOSED (whole-history non-omission, no `hweld`)

§2's grounded theorems are the ROOT FACE — non-omission for ONE deployed published commit. The lift to
WHOLE-HISTORY (`AggregateAttests` over every folded step) needed the IVC aggregation model itself to
fold the rotated commit. That is now DONE: `HistoryAggregation.chainedCommit` (= `hash_many [d, iroot]`,
the deployed rotated commit) IS the per-turn commitment the chain folds (`ChainStep.oldRoot/newRoot`),
so its receipt-log limb binds the log at EVERY step (`root_tooth_pins_log`). §4 re-exposes the closed
headline `light_client_whole_history_non_omission` (= `RecursiveAggregation.non_omission_from_verification`):
`verify agg.root = true` ⟹ `LogChained` over the whole history — omission impossible everywhere, no
`hweld`. The aggregation model no longer lags the deployed Rust.

/-! ## §1 — THE REPAIR, WELDED INTO THE MODEL: the chain now folds the rotated commit (binds the log).

The kernel-only `recStateCommit` was BLIND to the receipt log; the canonical aggregation model now folds
`HistoryAggregation.chainedCommit` (= `hash_many [d, iroot]`, the deployed rotated commit), so
`ChainStep.newRoot` ABSORBS the receipt-log root as its second limb. The blindness is now a property of
the KERNEL-DIGEST LIMB ALONE (`stateRoot`, the FIRST limb) — which is exactly WHY the rotated commit
adds the second. -/

/-- **The rotated commit BINDS the receipt log (the repair).** `ChainStep.newRoot` is now the rotated
`chainedCommit`, which absorbs `logRoot … st.log`. Two steps sharing a turn whose `newRoot`s agree have
EQUAL receipt logs — directly `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_log`, here for two `newRoot`s. A node
that drops/forges/reorders a receipt MOVES the published commit; a pure light client, holding only that
commit, now CATCHES it. (Contrast the pre-repair `newRoot_blind_to_log`, which this supersedes.) -/

/-- **The kernel-digest LIMB alone admits omission — WHY the rotated commit needs the log root.** The
FIRST limb `stateRoot … k t` (= `recStateCommit`, the kernel digest) is a function of the kernel and
turn ALONE: the full receipt log and ANY log with a receipt omitted map to the SAME kernel-digest limb
(`rfl`), while their receipt-log MMR roots DIFFER (`mroot_injective`). This is the residual that a
kernel-ONLY chained commit would have left open — and precisely what the rotated commit's SECOND limb
(`logRoot`, `newRoot_binds_log` above) closes. -/

/-- **The CONTRAST that drives the repair: a commit absorbing the log pins it UNIQUELY.** Two
`CommitBindsMMR` openings of ONE commit force EQUAL logs (`commit_pins_mmr`). The kernel commit
cannot supply this — it is the SAME for distinct logs (`recStateCommit_admits_receipt_omission`), so
`CommitBindsMMR hash limbs (recStateCommit … k t) log` has no honest discharge for the deployed log.
A commit that DOES absorb the root (the rotated commit, §2) regains this uniqueness — which is
exactly why binding to it makes non-omission real. -/

/-! ## §4 — WHOLE-HISTORY: the §3 residual CLOSED (the aggregation model folds the rotated commit).

§2 grounded the ROOT FACE — non-omission for ONE deployed published commit. The §3 residual was the
WHOLE-HISTORY lift: it needed the IVC aggregation model to fold the rotated commit, `stateRoot :=
rotatedCommit` in place of the kernel `recStateCommit`. That is now DONE: `HistoryAggregation.chainedCommit`
(= `hash_many [d, iroot]`) IS the per-turn commitment the chain folds (`ChainStep.oldRoot/newRoot`), so
its second limb binds the receipt log at EVERY folded step (`root_tooth_pins_log`). The whole-history
non-omission headline is therefore DERIVED from the one client check `verify agg.root = true`, with NO
`hweld`: `RecursiveAggregation.non_omission_from_verification` yields `LogChained` over the entire
attested history. We re-expose it here, in the grounded home, as the closed §3 residual. -/

/-- **`light_client_whole_history_non_omission` — the §3 residual CLOSED.** A light client that checks
ONLY `verify agg.root = true` learns the receipt log chains genuinely across the WHOLE history
(`LogChained g steps`): no node dropped / forged / reordered / truncated a receipt at ANY folded step.
The receipt-log binding is the rotated commit's second limb welded into the aggregation model
(`root_tooth_pins_log`), discharged under the one CR floor (`compressNInjective`) — there is NO `hweld`
hypothesis. This is `RecursiveAggregation.non_omission_from_verification`, the whole-history twin of §2's
single-commit grounded non-omission. -/
