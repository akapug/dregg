# Dregg2.Bignum — the unified, PROVEN, EMITTABLE bignum arithmetic every dregg circuit weld builds on.

Numerics bugs — overflow, underflow-wrap, a field equation mistaken for an integer equation,
off-by-one — are the #1 way protocols get drained. This module is the numerics bedrock: the
schoolbook bignum operations (`compare` / `sub` / `add` / `mul` / `mod` / `range`), each with

  1. a WITNESS GATE SYSTEM — the schoolbook per-limb equations, in the SAME arithmetic IR
     (`Dregg2.Circuit.Expr`/`Constraint`) + range checks (`Dregg2.Circuit.Lookup.rangeCheck`) that
     `circuit/src/lean_descriptor_air.rs` ingests, so it is EMITTABLE, not a mirror;
  2. a SOUNDNESS + COMPLETENESS keystone (`_iff`) — a valid witness EXISTS iff the INTEGER relation
     holds (never a mod-`p` field equality passed off as an integer one), in the shape of the
     compare keystone `CaveatBignum.borrowSub_iff`;
  3. the ANTI-EXPLOIT theorems, each of the #1-protocol-killer classes proven UNCONSTRUCTABLE:
       * NO-OVERFLOW      — add/mul results are range-bounded; the field cannot wrap (`add_iff`,
                            `add_overflow_unsat`, `bignumVal_mul_bound`);
       * NO-UNDERFLOW-WRAP — a subtraction below zero has NO valid witness (UNSAT) — the
                            burn/transfer-debit drain class (`sub_underflow_unsat`);
       * FIELD-vs-INTEGER — a mod-`p`-equal-but-integer-unequal witness does not exist under the
                            range bounds — the mint-by-wraparound class (`rangeBound_field_faithful`,
                            `legs_noWrap_conservation`);
       * CANONICALITY     — a modular reduction is unique/unbiased; a non-canonical representative is
                            UNSAT (`modValid_unique`, `mod_noncanonical_unsat`).
  4. NON-VACUITY at BOTH polarities — a valid computation has a witness; the exploit
     (overflow/underflow/wraparound/non-canonical) has NONE — `#guard`ed at deployed params.

## The shared denotation (reused, not re-derived)

`bignumVal B : List ℤ → ℤ` (the base-`B` little-endian limb integer) and `Ranged B` (each limb in
`[0, B)`) are `Dregg2.Circuit.CaveatBignum`'s — the SAME denotation the compare keystone is stated
over. Everything here is stated over that core, so a weld gets one algebra, not five. The comparison
op is `borrowSub_iff`/`bignumLe_iff`/`bignumLt_iff` lifted verbatim; `sub` reuses the SAME `BSValid`
borrow-subtraction witness (its value identity + underflow-UNSAT tooth); `add`/`mul`/`mod`/`range`
add the carry-chain, schoolbook-product, Euclidean-reduction, and bit-decomposition gate systems.

`Int`-valued, `sorry`-free, `#assert_axioms`-clean; the STATEMENTS are audited (no vacuity — every
op is exhibited true AND its exploit exhibited false at the deployed params).

/-! ## §1 — Foundational bounds over the shared denotation.

A ranged limb list is a NON-NEGATIVE integer that FITS in its width (`< Bⁿ`). These two facts are the
backbone of every no-overflow argument: "fits in `n` limbs" is exactly "cannot wrap a field of size
`≥ Bⁿ`". They are stated over `CaveatBignum.bignumVal`/`Ranged` — the reused shared core. -/

/-! ## §2 — COMPARE (`≤` / `<`): the keystone, lifted verbatim.

The comparison op IS `CaveatBignum.borrowSub_iff`. We re-export it under the unified-library names so a
weld imports `Dregg2.Bignum.le_iff` / `lt_iff` rather than reaching across to the caveat module. The
witness is the schoolbook borrow-subtraction `BSValid` (incoming borrow `0` = `≤`, `1` = strict `<`);
a valid witness exists iff the integer comparison holds. -/

/-- **`le_iff`** — a valid borrow-sub witness (incoming borrow `0`) exists iff `X ≤ Y`. -/
theorem le_iff {B : ℤ} (hB : 0 < B) (xs ys : List ℤ)
    (hlen : xs.length = ys.length) (hrx : Ranged B xs) (hry : Ranged B ys) :
    (∃ ds, BSValid B xs ys ds 0) ↔ bignumVal B xs ≤ bignumVal B ys :=
  bignumLe_iff hB xs ys hlen hrx hry

/-- **`lt_iff`** — a valid borrow-sub witness (incoming borrow `1`) exists iff `X < Y` (strict). -/
theorem lt_iff {B : ℤ} (hB : 0 < B) (xs ys : List ℤ)

    (∃ ds, BSValid B xs ys ds 1) ↔ bignumVal B xs < bignumVal B ys :=
  bignumLt_iff hB xs ys hlen hrx hry

/-! ## §3 — SUB: `diff = minuend − subtrahend`, and the ANTI-UNDERFLOW-WRAP tooth.

Subtraction reuses the SAME borrow-subtraction witness as compare (`BSValid`, no borrowing off the
top). The value identity says the difference limbs denote exactly `minuend − subtrahend`; the
existence keystone (from `borrowSub_iff`) says a valid witness exists IFF `subtrahend ≤ minuend`. So a
would-underflow subtraction (`minuend < subtrahend`) has NO valid witness — the debit that would wrap
to a huge positive balance is UNSAT. This is the burn / transfer-debit drain class, closed. -/

/-- A `BSValid` witness with incoming borrow `br` denotes the exact difference: the difference limbs
reconstruct `Y − X − br`. Pure value identity (no range needed) — proved by induction on the limbs. -/
theorem bsValid_val {B : ℤ} :
    ∀ (xs ys ds : List ℤ) (br : ℤ), BSValid B xs ys ds br →
      bignumVal B ds = bignumVal B ys - bignumVal B xs - br

/-- A `BSValid` difference is itself a valid ranged bignum (each difference limb range-checked into
`[0, B)`) — so `sub` COMPOSES with the other ops. General over the incoming borrow. -/

/-- **`SubValid B minuend subtrahend diff`** — `diff` is the schoolbook borrow-difference
`minuend − subtrahend` with no borrow off the top. (The witness is `CaveatBignum.BSValid` with the
operands in subtraction order and incoming borrow `0`.) -/
def SubValid (B : ℤ) (minuend subtrahend diff : List ℤ) : Prop :=
  BSValid B subtrahend minuend diff 0

/-- The difference limbs are themselves a valid (ranged) bignum — so `sub` COMPOSES with the other

  bignumLe_iff hB subtrahend minuend hlen hrs hrm

/-- **THE ANTI-UNDERFLOW-WRAP THEOREM.** A subtraction that would go below zero
(`minuend < subtrahend`) has NO valid witness — it is UNSAT. There is no difference-limb assignment,
so a burn/debit exceeding the balance cannot be proven; the wraparound-to-a-huge-balance mint is
UNCONSTRUCTABLE. -/
theorem sub_underflow_unsat {B : ℤ} (hB : 0 < B) (minuend subtrahend : List ℤ)
    (hlen : subtrahend.length = minuend.length)

/-! ## §4 — ADD: `sum = x + y` with the carry chain, and the ANTI-OVERFLOW tooth.

The schoolbook carry chain, mirroring the borrow chain: per limb
`sⱼ = xⱼ + yⱼ + cinⱼ − coutⱼ·B` with `sⱼ ∈ [0, B)`, boolean carries, incoming carry pinned, and the
TOP carry pinned `0` (no carry off the top — the result FITS the width). The value identity says the
sum limbs denote exactly `x + y (+ incoming carry)`; the existence keystone says a valid witness
exists IFF the true sum fits in `n` limbs (`< Bⁿ`). So an addition that would overflow the width has
NO witness — the field cannot be made to wrap. -/

/-- **`AddValid B xs ys ss cin`** — the sum limbs `ss` are the schoolbook carry-addition of `xs`, `ys`
with incoming carry `cin`, each limb range-checked and each carry boolean, the carry off the top
pinned `0` (the sum FITS in the width — the anti-overflow discipline). -/

Two faces. (a) The GENERAL width bound: the product of an `m`-limb and an `n`-limb ranged bignum is

below the field modulus (this is `VaultSatDescriptor.limbMul_lt` generalized to arbitrary width).

/-! ## §6 — MOD / REDUCE: canonical Euclidean reduction, and the CANONICALITY teeth.

`r = x mod m` with `0 ≤ r < m` — the reduction that makes a field element CANONICAL (used everywhere a
value must be a unique representative). The witness is the Euclidean pair `x = q·m + r` with `r`
range-checked into `[0, m)`. The soundness+completeness keystone pins `(q, r)` to the exact Euclidean
quotient/remainder. The teeth: the reduction is UNIQUE (no bias), and a NON-canonical representative
(`r ≥ m`, still congruent) has NO witness — the mint-by-alternate-representative class, closed. -/

/-- **`ModValid x q r m`** — the emittable reduction witness: `x = q·m + r` with `r` range-checked into

/-! ## §7 — RANGE: bit-decomposition, and the ANTI-WRAPAROUND (field-vs-integer) keystone.

A range gadget bit-decomposes a value into `[0, 2ⁿ)`. In the shared denotation this is exactly
`bignumVal 2 bits` with `Ranged 2 bits` (each "limb" a bit in `{0,1}`), so the fits lemma gives
`value ∈ [0, 2ⁿ)` for free. The load-bearing consequence — generalizing `RealCrypto`'s
`twoLeg_noWrap_conservation` — is that WITH the range bound a BabyBear FIELD equation IS the integer
equation: a value-minting wraparound (an output committed to `p − k`) is refuted, because range-bounded
integers below `p` that agree mod `p` are equal. -/

/-- A bit-list (`Ranged 2`) denotes a value in `[0, 2ⁿ)` — the meaning of the range gadget, as an
instance of the fits lemma at base `2`. -/
theorem range_bits_bound (bits : List ℤ) (hr : Ranged 2 bits) :

/-- **`rangeBound_field_faithful` — THE ANTI-WRAPAROUND KEYSTONE (single value).** Two range-bounded
values (`0 ≤ a,b < P`) in a field of size `p ≥ P` that agree mod `p` are EQUAL over ℤ. This is what
upgrades a field-gate equality to an integer equality — the range bound (`P ≤ p`) is LOAD-BEARING:
drop it and a wraparound (`a`, `a + p`) satisfies the congruence while minting. -/
