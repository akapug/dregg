# Dregg2.Widget.DreggForest — a dregg call-FOREST rendered as a node/edge graph (the executor inspector).

This leaf widget draws a real `FullForestA` (the tree-shaped, 46-effect, auth-gated call-forest the
wholesale-swap exports — `Dregg2/Exec/FullForest.lean`) as an interactive force-directed graph using
ProofWidgets' `GraphDisplay`. It is the *structural* companion to `Widget/Basic.lean`'s proof-fact trust
badge: the badge answers "*is this theorem proved, on what trust?*"; this widget answers "*what does this
turn's call-tree actually DO, and where does delegated authority flow?*".

THE "NO PLACEHOLDERS" DISCIPLINE — every glyph is COMPUTED from the real Lean value, never typed in:

  * **Nodes** are the forest's tree nodes. A node's label is `ctorName a` — the genuine `FullActionA`
    constructor at that node (a total fold over the actual 46-constructor inductive at
    `TurnExecutorFull.lean:1928`) — together with `targetOf a`, the cell the executor reads as that node's
    target (`FullForest.lean:123`, the very `targetOf` the executor uses as each child edge's *delegator*).
    Click a node: its `details?` lists `ctorSummary a` (the constructor's real argument vector). If you
    swap the value for a different forest, the labels change with it — there is no hard-coded label table.

  * **Edges** are the forest's delegation edges, walked in the SAME pre-order the executor lowers
    (`lowerForestA`). Each edge is drawn from the parent node to the child subtree's root, labelled with the
    delegation it carries — the holder, the *attenuated* rights `capAuthConferred (attenuate keep parentCap)`
    actually conferred, and the cap's target `capTarget parentCap` (`FullForest.lean:114`, the discriminant
    the executor gates on). Click an edge: its `details?` shows the held-vs-granted Granovetter inequality
    `capAuthConferred (attenuate keep parentCap) ⊆ capAuthConferred parentCap` (`edge_no_amplify`,
    `FullForest.lean:389`) — the no-amplification law, READ off the edge data, not asserted.

The driving value is `Dregg2.Exec.FullForest.goodFullForest` — the project's own non-vacuous witness: a
3-node, 3-level mint→transfer→burn tree that commits per-asset (`execFullForestA fmaDeleg goodFullForest`
is `some`) with two held, non-amplifying delegation edges. The `#html` at the bottom forces the
render path to elaborate over that real value, so the build EXERCISES the whole derivation.

Every rendering function is a total, term-level fold
over the real `FullForestA`/`FullActionA`/`Cap` data; the pure derivations are `#assert_axioms`-pinned to
the standard kernel triple. The `#html`/`#eval`s at the bottom are the non-vacuity witnesses (a different
forest yields a different graph — proven by an `#eval` contrast on the derived vertex/edge counts).

/-! ## §1 — Labels DERIVED from the real value (`ctorName` · `ctorSummary` · the `Cap`/`Auth` printers).

These are the heart of "no placeholders": each is a total fold over the ACTUAL inductive, so the glyph a
node/edge shows is a function of the value. `ctorName` returns the genuine `FullActionA` constructor name
(all 56 arms of `TurnExecutorFull.lean`'s `FullActionA`); `ctorSummary` additionally splices the constructor's real
argument vector. Swap the forest and the labels follow — nothing is hard-coded. -/

/-- **`ctorSummary a`** — the constructor name PLUS its real argument vector (for the representative arms
the demo forests exercise: balance/mint/burn/the authority + state ops). Spliced from the value's actual
fields, so a node's details box shows the genuine `(actor, cell, asset, amount)` etc. Arms not surfaced by
the demo trees fall through to `ctorName a` (still the real constructor, no fabricated args). -/

/-! ## §1.5 — Small inline-styled chips for the graph (HTML inside the SVG `<foreignObject>`).

`GraphDisplay` draws labels as SVG; non-SVG (HTML) labels go inside `<foreignObject>`. These chips reuse the
`Basic.lean` palette (`panelBg`/`panelBorder`/`keyColor`/`valColor`) so the forest matches the badge look. -/

/-! ## §2 — Node / edge data, COMPUTED from the forest, as plain `GraphDisplay.Vertex`/`Edge` records.

We walk the `FullForestA` in EXECUTION pre-order (a node, then its children left-to-right — exactly
`lowerForestA`'s order) threading a unique path id (`"n"`, `"n.0"`, `"n.0.1"`, …). For each node we emit one
`Vertex` whose label is the derived `ctorName`/`targetOf`; for each child we emit one `Edge` (parent → child
root) carrying the delegation's holder, conferred (attenuated) rights, and `capTarget`. The walk is
structural over the mutual `FullForestA`/`List FullChildA` (the same shape as `lowerForestA`). -/

/-- The vertex label: a small `<foreignObject>`-wrapped pill showing the effect constructor and its target
cell. Built from `ctorName a` + `targetOf a` — the real constructor and the executor's target field. -/
def nodeLabel (a : FullActionA) : Html :=
  -- `<g transform>` centres the `<foreignObject>` on the vertex (string attr ⇒ no `Neg Json`).
  <g transform="translate(-70,-16)">
    <foreignObject width={140} height={32}>
      {panelNodeChip s!"{ctorName a}" s!"→cell {targetOf a}"}
    </foreignObject>
  </g>

/-- A node's details: the full constructor summary + the target the executor reads. -/
def nodeDetails (a : FullActionA) : Html :=
  panel "node · effect" #[
    kvRowText "constructor" (ctorName a),
    kvRowText "summary" (ctorSummary a),
    kvRowText "targetOf (delegator)" (toString (targetOf a))
  ]

/-- An edge's label: the conferred (ATTENUATED) rights and the delegation target. Computed via the real
`attenuate`/`capAuthConferred`/`capTarget`, so it shows what the child ACTUALLY gains, not the declared cap. -/
def edgeLabel (keep : List Auth) (parentCap : Cap) : Html :=
  <g transform="translate(-58,-14)">
    <foreignObject width={116} height={28}>
      {panelEdgeChip (authsStr (capAuthConferred (attenuate keep parentCap))) (capTargetArrow parentCap)}
    </foreignObject>
  </g>

/-- An edge's details: the delegation holder, the parent cap, the attenuation `keep`, the cap target, AND
the no-amplification fact `conferred ⊆ capAuthConferred parentCap` (`edge_no_amplify`), READ off the data. -/
def edgeDetails (holder : Label) (keep : List Auth) (parentCap : Cap) : Html :=

/-- A single graph node for a forest node at path id `pid`. -/
def mkVertex (pid : String) (a : FullActionA) : GraphDisplay.Vertex :=

    attrs := #[("strokeWidth", (2 : Nat)), ("className", "dim")] }

/-! ## §3 — The structural WALK: forest → (vertices, edges), in execution pre-order.

Mutual structural recursion over `FullForestA`/`List FullChildA` (the same recursion shape as
`lowerForestA`/`lowerChildrenA`). `forestGraph pid f` emits `f`'s root vertex at `pid` and recurses into its
children; `childrenGraph pid i kids` emits, for the `i`-th child, the parent→child edge and the child's
subgraph. The path id makes every vertex id unique. -/

mutual
/-- The vertices+edges of a forest rooted at path `pid`. -/
def forestGraph (pid : String) : FullForestA → (Array GraphDisplay.Vertex × Array GraphDisplay.Edge)
  | ⟨a, kids⟩ =>
    let v := mkVertex pid a
    let (vs, es) := childrenGraph pid 0 kids
    (#[v] ++ vs, es)

/-- The vertices+edges of a child list, the `i`-th child rooted at `pid.i`; each child contributes its
parent→child delegation edge (holder/keep/parentCap) plus its own subgraph. -/

    List FullChildA → (Array GraphDisplay.Vertex × Array GraphDisplay.Edge)

    let edge := mkEdge pid cp holder keep parentCap
    let (subV, subE) := forestGraph cp sub
    let (restV, restE) := childrenGraph pid (i + 1) rest
    (subV ++ restV, #[edge] ++ subE ++ restE)
end

def forestVertices (f : FullForestA) : Array GraphDisplay.Vertex := (forestGraph "n" f).1
/-- The edges of a forest (root path `"n"`). -/
def forestEdges (f : FullForestA) : Array GraphDisplay.Edge := (forestGraph "n" f).2

/-! ### The node-label list, in execution pre-order — the textual shadow of the rendered nodes.

`forestCtorNames` is the SAME pre-order walk as `forestGraph`, collecting each node's derived `ctorName`
(rather than building a vertex). It is the `#eval`-able non-vacuity witness: the list of labels the graph
draws, derived purely from the value — feed a different forest and the list changes. -/

mutual
/-- The derived `ctorName` of every forest node, in execution pre-order (`lowerForestA` order). -/
def forestCtorNames : FullForestA → List String
  | ⟨a, kids⟩ => ctorName a :: childrenCtorNames kids
/-- The derived `ctorName`s of a child list's subtrees, in order. -/
def childrenCtorNames : List FullChildA → List String
  | []                      => []
  | ⟨_, _, _, sub⟩ :: rest  => forestCtorNames sub ++ childrenCtorNames rest
end

/-! ## §5 — The forest panel + the `#html` driver (forces the render over the REAL value).

`dreggForestGraph f` is the full `GraphDisplay` for a forest. The `#html` below elaborates it over
`Dregg2.Exec.FullForest.goodFullForest` (the project's own committing, non-amplifying 3-node tree), so the
verify step EXERCISES the whole derivation — `ctorName`/`targetOf`/`attenuate`/`capTarget` over real data. -/

/-- The complete `GraphDisplay` element for a forest: vertices+edges from the structural walk, with a link
force tuned for a readable tree layout, and the details box enabled (click a node/edge). -/
def dreggForestGraph (f : FullForestA) : Html :=
  <GraphDisplay
    vertices={forestVertices f}
    edges={forestEdges f}
    forces={#[ .link { distance? := some 140 }, .manyBody { strength? := some (-260) },
               .x { strength? := some 0.06 }, .y { strength? := some 0.06 } ]}
    showDetails={true} />

/-- The forest graph wrapped in the dregg panel (title + a one-line legend). -/
def dreggForestPanel (title : String) (f : FullForestA) : Html :=
  <div style={json% {
      background: $panelBg,
      border: $("1px solid " ++ panelBorder),
      borderRadius: "8px",
      padding: "12px 14px",
      maxWidth: "720px",

    <div style={json% {fontSize: "11px", color: $keyColor, marginBottom: "8px"}}>

    </div>
    {dreggForestGraph f}
  </div>

/-! **THE RENDER DRIVER.** Force-elaborate the forest graph over the REAL `goodFullForest` value. The
`#html` command runs the full derivation (walk + `ctorName`/`targetOf`/`attenuate`/`capTarget` over the
actual tree) and saves the widget — so the leaf build exercises the render path. Put your cursor
on the command to see the interactive graph. -/

/-! ## §6 — NON-VACUITY (`#eval`): the graph is COMPUTED from the value, and a DIFFERENT forest gives a
DIFFERENT graph. If the derivation were placeholder, these counts/labels would not track the value. -/

-- `goodFullForest`: 3 nodes (mint root, transfer child, burn grandchild) ⇒ 3 vertices, 2 delegation edges.
#guard (forestVertices goodFullForest).size == 3   -- 3
#guard (forestEdges goodFullForest).size == 2      -- 2

-- The derived node labels ARE the real constructors, in pre-order (mint → balance → burn):

-- The EDGE labels are the ATTENUATED conferred rights (not the declared cap). `goodFullForest`'s first edge
-- keeps `[read]` of an `endpoint [read,write]` cap ⇒ conferred drops `write` (the Granovetter shrink shows).

/-! ## §7 — Axiom hygiene. The pure derivations (the glyph + the walk) are pinned kernel-clean.

The label/summary/printer functions and the structural walk that PRODUCE the graph must themselves be
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`-clean — they carry the widget's "computed, not faked" credibility.
(The `Html` builders inherit ProofWidgets' own clean axioms; we pin the dregg-specific derivations.) -/
