# Dregg2.Deos.FireProgramAgreement — the fire→CellProgram seam: the surface state-gate and the
EXECUTOR's installed-program gate provably DECIDE THE SAME TRANSITIONS, so a darkened affordance
cannot be bypassed by firing the turn straight at the executor.

`Dregg2.Deos.{GatedAffordance, WorkflowBridge}` (the deos surface) + `Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.Policy`
(the executor's installed-policy enforcement).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Two gates over the SAME installed `RecordProgram` grew up apart, each proven on
its own side:

  * THE SURFACE GATE — `GatedAffordance.fireGated ga held ctx old new`. Its state leg is
    `ga.stateCond.admitsCtx ctx ga.method old new` (`RecordProgram.admitsCtx`, i.e. `evalConstraintCtx`).
    `fireGated_iff` is the surface keystone: the deos button lights IFF caps AND state both pass; the
    darkening teeth are `fireGated_state_fail_refuses` (the surface) and `gated_state_fail_is_out_of_order`
    (the workflow rendering).
  * THE EXECUTOR GATE — `Argus.Policy.policyGuarded view prog w s`. It runs the cell's INSTALLED program
    `prog : List StateConstraint` over the same `(old, new)` slot view via `programToGuard`
    (→ `constraintToGuard` → `evalConstraint`), and `policyGuarded_reject` is fail-closed: no effect
    commits unless every installed constraint admits.

What nobody had SHOWN is that these two gates, fed the SAME installed program, decide the SAME
transitions. Without that, "a gated affordance cannot be bypassed" is only TESTED: the surface
darkening and the executor refusal happen to coincide on the worked examples, but a malicious client
who skips the surface and fires the turn STRAIGHT at the executor has no PROVEN wall. This module is
that wall — the surface state-gate and the executor program-gate are the SAME predicate, both reducing
to `cs.all (evalConstraint · old new)` over the installed program, so the executor RE-ENFORCES exactly
what the surface would have refused.

THE BRIDGE (what is proven). For an installed program `cs : List StateConstraint` whose constraints
are all `locallyDecidable` (the first-party arms — every catalog atom except the cross-cell `boundDelta`,
which the single-cell evaluator routes to the §8 verify seam rather than the live gate), and any slot
`view` presenting the cell's `(old, new)` records:

  * §2 `installedProgram_gate_eq_surface_stateGate` (KEYSTONE) — the EXECUTOR program-gate verdict
    `(programToGuard view cs).admits k w` EQUALS the SURFACE state-gate verdict
    `(RecordProgram.predicate cs).admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty method (view k).1 (view k).2`. Same installed
    program ⇒ same verdict; both are `cs.all (evalConstraint · (view k).1 (view k).2)`. The two gates
    are not merely tested-equal — they ARE the same Boolean.
  * §3 `bypass_refused_by_executor` (THE BYPASS-IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM) — if the SURFACE darkens a fire
    on STATE grounds (the installed program rejects the slot transition), then the EXECUTOR's
    installed-program-gated effect ALSO refuses (`policyGuarded … = none`), REGARDLESS of the effect
    body. A turn the surface would not light cannot be slipped past the executor: the kernel re-enforces
    the installed program on the fired turn. (`surface_dark_iff_executor_refuses` packages the iff.)
  * §4 the WORKFLOW specialization — `workflow_out_of_phase_bypass_refused`: a workflow step fired from
    the WRONG phase (the surface's `gated_state_fail_is_out_of_order` darkening) is refused by the
    executor running the step's installed phase-precondition program `[stateCond-as-constraint]`. The
    "no merge before approval" dark button is ALSO a "no merge before approval" executor refusal.
  * §5 BITING `#guard`/theorem teeth: a concrete installed `memberOf` program where the surface lights
    (role ∈ allowlist) and the executor admits, and darkens (role ∉ allowlist) and the executor
    refuses — the SAME verdict on both sides, both polarities.

This is NOT new mathematics and NOT a third gate. The surface state-gate is the REAL
`RecordProgram.admitsCtx`; the executor gate is the REAL `Argus.Policy.policyGuarded`; the agreement is
the EXISTING `constraintToGuard_firstParty_eval` (executor per-constraint = `evalConstraint`) conjoined
list-wise and met against the EXISTING `admitsCtx_empty` (`admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty = admits` reduces a
`predicate` program to the same `cs.all evalConstraint`). The weld, not a build.

THE CTX SCOPE (honest). The executor's installed-program path (`constraintToGuard`) routes through the
ctx-LESS `evalConstraint` — exactly what `turn/`'s program-check runs for the first-party catalog. The
agreement is therefore stated at the surface's `TurnCtx.empty` specialization (`admitsCtx_empty`), the
faithful match: the context atoms (`senderIs`/`balance…`) are the ctx-aware EXTENSION both sides fail
closed on under the empty context, and a turn-context-bearing executor gate is the lift the convergence
carries forward — not weakened here, scoped honestly.

Discipline: `#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no
`native_decide`, no new axiom; NON-VACUOUS (§5 exhibits both verdicts). `lake build

/-! ## §1 — THE TWO GATES REDUCE TO THE SAME `evalConstraint` CONJUNCTION.

The surface state-gate `(RecordProgram.predicate cs).admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty m old new` is
`cs.all (evalConstraintCtx TurnCtx.empty · old new)` (the `predicate` arm), which is
`cs.all (evalConstraint · old new)` by `evalConstraintCtx_empty`. The executor program-gate
`(programToGuard view cs).admits k w` is the `Guard.all` meet of each `constraintToGuard view c`,
which (for `locallyDecidable` constraints) is `evalConstraint c (view k).1 (view k).2`. We prove the
executor gate equals that same conjunction by list induction, then meet the two against the surface
side. -/

/-- **`executorGate_eq_all_eval`** — the EXECUTOR's routed program-gate over an all-locally-decidable
installed program is exactly the `evalConstraint` conjunction on the slot view: `(programToGuard view
cs).admits k w = cs.all (fun c => evalConstraint c (view k).1 (view k).2)`. The meet of the routed
first-party guards IS the conjunction of the live-leg checks (each `constraintToGuard view c` reduces
by `constraintToGuard_firstParty_eval`). -/

`(RecordProgram.predicate cs).admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty m old new = cs.all (evalConstraint · old new)`.

/-! ## §2 — THE KEYSTONE: the executor's installed-program gate IS the surface state-gate. -/

/-- **`installedProgram_gate_eq_surface_stateGate` — THE KEYSTONE.** For one installed program `cs`
(all-locally-decidable) and the slot `view` presenting `(old, new) = (view k).1, (view k).2`, the
EXECUTOR program-gate verdict EQUALS the SURFACE state-gate verdict:

    (programToGuard view cs).admits k w
      = (RecordProgram.predicate cs).admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty method (view k).1 (view k).2

The two gates are the SAME Boolean — both `cs.all (evalConstraint · (view k))`. So the surface gate and
the kernel gate are PROVEN-equal, not merely tested-equal: whatever the deos button decides on state
grounds, the executor decides identically on the fired turn. -/

      surfaceStateGate_eq_all_eval cs method (view k).1 (view k).2]

/-! ## §3 — BYPASS-IMPOSSIBILITY: a fire the SURFACE darkens on state grounds is REFUSED by the EXECUTOR.

The threat is a malicious client who skips the deos surface and fires the turn STRAIGHT at the executor.
The defense is that the executor RE-ENFORCES the installed program. We prove it: if the SURFACE state-gate
fails (the installed `cs` rejects the slot transition the button reads), then the EXECUTOR's
installed-program-gated effect `policyGuarded view cs w s` REFUSES (`= none`), for ANY effect body `s`.
The surface darkening and the executor refusal are the SAME decision (the §2 keystone), so a darkened
affordance has a PROVEN wall, not a tested coincidence. -/

/-- **`bypass_refused_by_executor` — THE BYPASS-IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM.** Suppose the SURFACE state-gate
over the installed program `cs` darkens the fire at this slot — the program REJECTS the `(view k)`
transition the button reads (`(RecordProgram.predicate cs).admitsCtx TurnCtx.empty method (view k).1
(view k).2 = false`). Then the EXECUTOR's installed-program-gated effect REFUSES for ANY effect body
`s`: `interp (policyGuarded view cs w s) k = none`. The fired turn cannot bypass the surface gate by
going straight to the executor — the kernel re-enforces the SAME installed program and fails closed. -/

/-- **`surface_dark_iff_executor_refuses` (the iff, both polarities).** The SURFACE state-gate darkens
the fire IFF the EXECUTOR's installed-program-gated effect refuses on state grounds — equivalently, the
EXECUTOR ADMITS the installed program IFF the SURFACE state-gate lights. The two gates agree in BOTH
directions: no state the surface lights is refused by the executor's program-gate, and no state the
surface darkens is admitted. (Stated on the program-gate verdict; the §3 commit-side direction rides
`policyGuarded_commit_iff`.) -/

/-! ## §3a — THE SURFACE SIDE, MADE EXPLICIT: the darkened button and the refusing executor SHARE
the installed program.

`fireGated_state_fail_refuses` (the surface tooth) darkens the button when its `stateCond` state-gate
fails. When that `stateCond` IS the installed `RecordProgram.predicate cs` and `ctx = TurnCtx.empty`,
the SAME failing-state hypothesis darkens the button AND (via §3) refuses the executor — one predicate,
two gates, both dark. -/

/-- **`gated_surface_and_executor_both_dark` (the surface button AND the executor, one program).**
Take a `GatedAffordance` whose state-gate IS the installed program (`ga.stateCond = .predicate cs`,
`ga.method = method`), fired against the slot `(view k)` the executor reads. If the installed program
REJECTS that transition, BOTH gates are dark: the deos button refuses (`fireGated … = none`) AND the
executor refuses (`policyGuarded … = none`). The bypass route (skip the button, fire at the executor)
hits the SAME wall — the installed program is enforced on both sides. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE WORKFLOW SPECIALIZATION: an out-of-phase step the surface darkens is REFUSED by the
executor running the step's installed phase-precondition program.

`WorkflowBridge.stateCond s` is the step's installed phase-gate `phase == precond s` (a one-constraint
`RecordProgram.predicate [phaseConstraint s]`). The surface darkens an out-of-phase step
(`gated_state_fail_is_out_of_order`); here we show the EXECUTOR, running that SAME one-constraint
installed program over the phase-cell slot, ALSO refuses. The "no merge before approval" dark button is
a "no merge before approval" executor refusal — the choreography order enforced on BOTH sides. -/
