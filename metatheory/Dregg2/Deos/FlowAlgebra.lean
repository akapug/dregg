# Dregg2.Deos.FlowAlgebra — the workflow/affordance-flow COMPOSITION ALGEBRA is RIGHT-SKEWED.

`docs/FLOW-COMPOSITION-ALGEBRA.md` (companion). Anchors: `Dregg2.Deos.Reactive` (the `TransitionGate`
reads BOTH `old` and `new` — the late-binding / online-choice mechanism; "a property of `new` alone can
never witness it"), `Dregg2.Deos.WorkflowBridge` (a `Protocol.Workflow` step IS a sequenced reactive
fire — the workflow exec is the `⋆`), and `Dregg2.Exec.Value` (the real name-keyed state substrate the
flows thread).

THE QUESTION (falsifiable). Does dregg's flow algebra satisfy FULL left-distributivity of CHOICE over
COMPOSITION — `(P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R = (P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R)` — or only the HALF
`(P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R) ≤ (P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R`?

THE ANSWER (this module, proved). **Only the HALF.** dregg's flow algebra is RIGHT-SKEWED: the half
holds (`flow_choice_halfdistrib`) but the converse FAILS (`flow_choice_right_skewed`, the headline).
dregg's flow algebra is a **right-skewed Kleene algebra with distributive meets** (RSKA_d⊓, à la Pradic,
"The Equational Theory of the Weihrauch Lattice with (Iterated) Composition", arXiv:2408.14999) — and
the distributive MEET is discharged here too (`flow_meet_semilattice`, the `_d⊓` of the classification).

WHY (the algebraic shadow of the reactive rung). The separation is NOT a trace-LANGUAGE fact — in trace
language the two sides are EQUAL (`flow_choice_languages_equal`, the dregg analogue of Pradic's
Example 1.1: `(b⋆a) ⊔ (c⋆a)` and `(b⊔c) ⋆ a` both denote `{ab, ac}`). The separation lives ONE rung up,
in the ONLINE step-by-step SIMULATION preorder (Pradic's SG game). We model a flow as a labelled
TRANSITION SYSTEM over the real `Value` state (each fire is a visible letter; `⊔` is a branch node; `⋆`
threads the state, `R` first), and `≤` as a STEP-BY-STEP SIMULATION: a relation matching each letter-move
of the simulated side by a letter-move of the simulator, PRESERVING the relation. In `(P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R`
(Pradic's order: `⋆`'s RIGHT factor runs FIRST), `R` runs first and emits its output letter; the
`P`-vs-`Q` branch is taken AFTER — from ONE node that still has BOTH continuations (the LATE branch,
exactly the `TransitionGate.link` reading `new`: the choice reads `R`'s output). In `(P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R)`
the branch is the FIRST node, committing BEFORE `R` runs (the EARLY branch). A step-by-step simulator of
the late side from the early side must, to match `R`'s move, have ALREADY committed its branch — so from
its post-`R` node only ONE continuation remains, and the late side's OTHER continuation cannot be matched.
No lookahead: the simulator commits before it learns which continuation will be demanded. The right-skew
is the algebraic shadow of the reactive/observed-state rung — Pradic: "the second component `f` of a
question `⟨w,f⟩ ∈ dom((P⊔Q)⋆R)` might decide whether a question should be asked to `P` or `Q` depending on
its input" — which is exactly the `old+new` read of the `TransitionGate`.

## What is built

  * §1 `Proc` + `Step` — a flow as a labelled transition system over the real `Value`: `done` (halt),
    `emit ℓ` (a visible letter then halt), `wr f v` (a state WRITE that ALSO emits its output letter —
    `R`'s observable, reading-its-output is the late-binding), `ch` (branch — offer both), `seqp`
    (sequential, state-threaded: the RIGHT factor runs first, then the left reads its post-state). The
    flow operators `⊔`/`⋆`/`⊓` and atoms compile to `Proc`s. ALL steps are visible letters (the
    simulation is over the observable transition graph, matching Pradic's automata).

  * §2 `IsSim` / `Flow.Sim` (the ONLINE simulation preorder `≤ᶠ`) — a STEP-BY-STEP SIMULATION: a
    relation `Rel` with `Rel (P-start) (Q-start)` such that every letter-move `c →ℓ d` of the simulated
    side is matched by a move `c' →ℓ d'` of the simulator with `Rel d d'`. Built step by step ⟹ the
    simulator commits ONLINE (no lookahead). A genuine preorder (`sim_refl`, `sim_trans`). NOT offline
    trace-containment (which would miss the separation — `flow_choice_languages_equal`).

  * §3 `flow_choice_halfdistrib` (THE HALF — always holds, keystone). `(P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R) ≤ (P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R`:
    the EARLY side step-by-step-simulates INTO the late side. The late side mimics the early side's
    committed branch — it has MORE freedom (after `R` it can still take EITHER branch), so the early
    behavior embeds. (Pradic: this direction holds throughout the Weihrauch lattice.)

  * §4 `flow_choice_right_skewed` (THE HEADLINE — the converse FAILS). The concrete REACTIVE
    counterexample: `R` runs and emits its output letter `0` (and writes a field); the `P`-vs-`Q` branch
    fires DIFFERENT letters `1`/`2`. We prove `(P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R ≰ (P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R)` — NO simulation embeds
    the late side into the early side: after matching `R`'s move `0`, the early simulator sits at a node
    that has ALREADY committed to one branch (one of `1`,`2`), but the late side's post-`R` node has
    BOTH live, so the late `1`-move and `2`-move cannot both be matched. The verdict: right-skewed.

  * §5 NON-VACUITY (`#guard` + the `_live`/`_run` lemmas): every load-bearing `≤` holds on a NON-empty
    transition graph (a vacuous simulation that holds because the graph is dead would be a BUG — pinned
    shut by exhibited letter-moves). `flow_choice_languages_equal` pins the separation is NOT in the
    language; the right-skew is genuinely the online rung.

## The payoff (a named follow-on — NOT built in this lane; `docs/FLOW-COMPOSITION-ALGEBRA.md` §Payoff)

If dregg's flow algebra is right-skewed (it is), then "does flow/caveat-policy A REFINE B" is a DECIDABLE
question via Pradic's Büchi / alternating-automata simulation-game characterization of RSKA_d⊓
(PSPACE-hard in general; PTIME on the pointed Weihrauch fragment) — Theorem 1.4: `e ≤ f` is valid iff
Duplicator wins `SG(∅ | {e} ⊢ f)`. The ARGUS "refines" bar (does this protocol evolution refine the
spec?) inherits a decision procedure with known complexity. This module pins the PRECONDITION of that
payoff — the right-skew — as a machine-checked theorem; the decision procedure itself is the follow-on.

/-! ## §1 — A flow as a labelled transition system over the real `Value` state.

A flow's behavior is a labelled transition graph: nodes are process states `(p, σ)` (the remaining
structure plus the live cell state); edges are VISIBLE letters (the affordance fired / `R`'s output). The
state is THREADED through `seqp`, so a later factor reads an earlier one's post-state — the `old → new`
read of the reactive `TransitionGate`, which is what makes the choice ONLINE.

ALL steps are VISIBLE (matching Pradic's automata, whose edges are all letters). The branch `ch` is a
NODE with both out-edges available — NOT a silent commitment — so the timing of the choice is encoded in
the GRAPH SHAPE (early = branch first; late = branch after `R`'s letter), which is exactly what the
step-by-step simulation can see and the trace language cannot. -/

/-- A `Letter` is one observed affordance fire (or `R`'s output) — a `Nat` tag. -/
abbrev Letter := Nat

/-- A `Trace` is the sequence of fired letters (the observable event log). -/
abbrev Trace := List Letter

/-- Update (or insert) field `f := .int v` in a record value; on a non-record, produce `{f := v}`. -/
def setField : Value → Dregg2.Exec.FieldName → Int → Value
  | .record fs, f, v =>
      if fs.any (fun p => p.1 == f)
      then .record (fs.map (fun p => if p.1 == f then (p.1, .int v) else p))
      else .record (fs ++ [(f, .int v)])
  | _, f, v => .record [(f, .int v)]

/-- **`Proc`** — a process tree (the syntax of a flow), so the labelled transition `Step` can read the
branch STRUCTURE (which distinguishes early from late choice). -/
inductive Proc where
  /-- The halted process (the unit of `seqp`). -/
  | done : Proc
  /-- Emit a visible letter `ℓ`, then halt (`fire ℓ`). -/
  | emit : Letter → Proc
  /-- A state WRITE `f := v` that ALSO emits its output letter `ℓ` (the `R` of the counterexample: it
  runs, mutates state, and produces an observable output the downstream choice reads). -/
  | wr   : Letter → Dregg2.Exec.FieldName → Int → Proc
  /-- BRANCH — offer BOTH continuations (`P ⊔ Q`): a node with both out-edges. -/
  | ch   : Proc → Proc → Proc
  /-- SEQUENTIAL composition (Pradic's order: do the RIGHT factor `r` FIRST, then the left `p` on `r`'s
  post-state). `seqp p r` runs `r` to a halt threading state, then continues as `p`. -/
  | seqp : Proc → Proc → Proc

/-- **`Step (p, σ) ℓ (p', σ')`** — one labelled (VISIBLE) small step from `(p, σ)` to `(p', σ')` emitting
letter `ℓ`. The `seqp` rule THREADS the state: the right factor steps first; only when it HALTS (`done`)
does control pass SILENTLY-VIA-A-HANDOFF… — but to keep ALL transitions visible-letter-labelled (so the
simulation is a clean letter-matching), the hand-off is folded into the right factor's LAST step: when
`r` would halt, `seqp p r` instead continues directly as `p` carrying `r`'s post-state. Concretely there
is no separate silent hand-off step — the `seqDone` case fires the FIRST letter of `p` from `r`'s
post-state in one move. We achieve this by the two `seqp` rules below. -/

  | emit (ℓ : Letter) (σ : Value) :
      Step (.emit ℓ, σ) ℓ (.done, σ)
  /-- `wr ℓ f v` emits its output letter `ℓ` AND writes `f := v` in one step (the `R`-move: run +
  observable output + state mutation). -/
  | wr (ℓ : Letter) (f : Dregg2.Exec.FieldName) (v : Int) (σ : Value) :

      Step (.ch p q, σ) ℓ (q', σ')
  /-- SEQ step: the RIGHT factor `r` takes a NON-halting step (it runs FIRST, `r` not yet done); `seqp p
  r` follows it, staying in the sequence. -/
  | seqR (p r r' : Proc) (σ σ' : Value) (ℓ : Letter) (h : Step (r, σ) ℓ (r', σ')) :
      Step (.seqp p r, σ) ℓ (.seqp p r', σ')
  /-- SEQ hand-off + first-move-of-`p`: when the right factor `r`'s step LANDS it in `done` (it just
  finished), control passes to the left factor `p`, whose FIRST move fires immediately from `r`'s
  post-state `σ'` (`p` reads what `r` wrote — the threading). One visible step carries `r`'s last letter;
  the next step is `p`'s first. We split it: a `seqp p done` is `p`. -/
  | seqDone (p p' : Proc) (σ σ' : Value) (ℓ : Letter) (h : Step (p, σ) ℓ (p', σ')) :
      Step (.seqp p .done, σ) ℓ (p', σ')

/-! ## §2 — The ONLINE simulation preorder `≤ᶠ` (a STEP-BY-STEP SIMULATION; no lookahead).

`P ≤ Q` ("`Q` online-simulates `P`") iff there is a SIMULATION relation `Rel` with `Rel (P-start)
(Q-start)` such that whenever `Rel c c'`, every letter-move `c →ℓ d` of the simulated side is matched by a
move `c' →ℓ d'` of the simulator with `Rel d d'`. The relation is built STEP BY STEP, so the simulator
commits its branch ONLINE — it must produce a matching move NOW, not knowing which move will be demanded
NEXT (no lookahead). This is the dregg analogue of Pradic's SG game (Theorem 1.4). It is STRICTLY FINER
than offline trace-containment: the late and early sides share a language
(`flow_choice_languages_equal`) yet are separated here (`flow_choice_right_skewed`). -/

/-- **`IsSim Rel`** — `Rel` is a (step-by-step) simulation: every letter-move of the LEFT (simulated) side
is matched by a letter-move of the RIGHT (simulator) side with the SAME letter, preserving `Rel`. -/

over the initial σ so the order is uniform in the cell's starting state). -/

/-! ## §1c — The MEET, as a genuine `SemilatticeInf` (the `_d⊓` of RSKA_d⊓).

The denotational MEET (run-set intersection — the §C2 `ReplayMembrane` negotiation meet, lifted to flows)
is a `SemilatticeInf` over the OFFLINE run-set order. We expose the denotation `runs` and the meet on it,
so the "distributive meet" of the classification is REAL. (The right-skew lives in the ONLINE order §2;
the meet's lattice structure is an OFFLINE fact, which is exactly where Pradic's distributive-meet axioms
sit — the lattice `⊓`/`⊔` ARE distributive among themselves; only `⊔`-over-`⋆` is skewed.) -/

def lang (P : Proc) : Value → Set Trace := fun σ => { t | runs P σ t }

/-- **`flow_meet_semilattice` — the language meet is a genuine `SemilatticeInf`.** Run-set intersection
is the greatest lower bound under pointwise containment (the §C2 negotiation meet, at the flow layer): so
the "distributive MEET" of RSKA_d⊓ is REAL here. The `_d⊓` of the classification is discharged. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE HALF (always holds): `(P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R) ≤ (P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R`.

The EARLY side step-by-step-simulates INTO the late side. The simulating relation `halfRel` covers the
reachable related pairs: the START pair (early branch-of-sequences ↦ late deferred sequence), a COMMITTED
branch still threading through `R`'s remaining process `r'` (early `seqp F r'` ↦ late `seqp (P⊔Q) r'`),
and the DIAGONAL once `R` has handed off. The crux: the early side commits its branch up front; the late
side matches by taking the SAME branch through its `ch` AFTER `R` — it has MORE freedom (it can defer), so
the early committed behavior embeds. No lookahead needed (the late side commits LATER than required). -/

indexed by `R`'s remaining process `r'` and the threaded state. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE HEADLINE: the converse FAILS — dregg's flow algebra is RIGHT-SKEWED.

The concrete REACTIVE counterexample. `R := run 0 "b" 1` runs, emits its output letter `0`, and writes
`b := 1` (the state a downstream reactive choice reads). The `P`-vs-`Q` branch fires DIFFERENT letters:
`P := fire 1`, `Q := fire 2`.

  * LATE `(P ⊔ Q) ⋆ R`: `R` runs first (one node, the `0`-move), landing in a node `(ch (fire 1)
    (fire 2), σ1)` that has BOTH the `1`-move and the `2`-move live (the choice is taken AFTER `R`,
    reading its output — the late-binding).
  * EARLY `(P ⋆ R) ⊔ (Q ⋆ R)`: the branch is the FIRST node. The `0`-move is available on either branch,
    but TAKING it commits the branch — after the `0`-move the early side sits at `(fire 1, σ1)` (only the
    `1`-move) OR `(fire 2, σ1)` (only the `2`-move).

A simulation embedding the late side into the early side must match `R`'s `0`-move; whatever early node
it lands in has ALREADY committed to one of `1`,`2` — so it cannot match BOTH of the late side's `1` and
`2` moves. We prove `¬ (late ≤ early)` — the right-skew. -/

before learning which letter would be demanded — no lookahead. This is the algebraic shadow of the
