# Dregg2.Deos.ConstraintBinding — a DECLARED capacity caveat cannot be OMITTED
(the soundness core of the house-capacity in-circuit welds: the manifest is no longer
prover-optional once the declared constraint-set is bound into committed state).

## The gap this closes

The §6 weld rungs (`SealedEscrow.lean`, `StandingObligation.lean`, `Vault.lean`) prove that
**if** a `SettleEscrow` / `DischargeObligation` / `VaultDeposit` manifest entry is PRESENT, its
re-evaluation FORCES the capacity invariant (atomicity / on-schedule / no-dilution). What they do
NOT establish is that the entry must be present at all: the slot-caveat manifest
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/verify.rs::verify_slot_caveat_manifest`) iterates the prover-published
`count` entries and re-evaluates each, but a forger who simply OMITS the entry (publishes
`count = 0`, or a manifest with no tag-17 entry) leaves the verifier nothing to check. The gate is
prover-OPTIONAL — the load-bearing soundness gap named in
`docs/deos/VK-EPOCH-CONSTRAINT-BINDING-DESIGN.md`.

## The fix, as a theorem

The closure binds each cell's DECLARED constraint-set into the cell's COMMITTED state (already true:
`cell/src/commitment.rs::compute_authority_digest_felt` folds `cell.program` — hence its
`state_constraints` — into `record_digest`, the `B_AUTHORITY_DIGEST` limb of the ~124-bit wide
commit a light client binds). A verifier that RE-DERIVES the required capacity tags from the
committed declaration and DEMANDS each is covered (present AND its gate re-evaluates true) cannot be
fooled by omission. This module is the Lean rung for that:

  * `verifierAccepts required m` — accept iff EVERY required tag is `covers`ed (present and
    satisfied). The omission-PROOF gate.
  * `omission_rejected` / `unsatisfied_rejected` — a manifest that omits a required tag, OR presents
    it with a failing gate, is REJECTED. The forger cannot drop the entry, nor present a hollow one.
  * `omission_caught_under_binding` — **THE SOUNDNESS CORE.** Under the declaration-commitment
    collision-resistance floor (`DeclCommitBinds`: equal commitments ⟹ equal required tags), a
    forger who presents an ALTERNATE declaration (e.g. one requiring nothing) to dodge coverage must
    publish a declaration whose commitment matches the committed one — and CR then forces the SAME
    required tags. So a turn on a capacity cell that omits its declared entry is rejected, whatever
    declaration the prover presents. Omission is caught, not prover-optional.
  * The escrow BRIDGE (`honest_settle_covers` / `partial_settle_not_covered`) ties the abstract
    `satisfied` bit to the genuine §6 `SealedEscrow.SettleGate` — so this is concretely about the
    sealed-escrow weld, reusing its proven `settle_passes_gate` / `partial_settle_rejected` teeth,
    not a free-floating list lemma.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` at the close. The only named hypothesis is the declaration-commitment binding
`DeclCommitBinds` (the authority-digest collision-resistance floor, the SAME shape as the
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor the heap/cap roots carry) — never an axiom. No core edit.

/-! ## §3 — THE SOUNDNESS CORE: the required set is fixed by the COMMITTED declaration.

`required` above is the re-derived required-tag set. The closure is that it is re-derived from the
cell's COMMITTED declaration, not chosen by the prover. We model a declared constraint-set `Decl`, a
commitment `declCommit : Decl → C` (the authority-digest fold), and the re-derivation
`requiredTags : Decl → List Tag`. The `DeclCommitBinds` floor — equal commitments ⟹ equal required
tags — is the collision-resistance of the authority digest (the SAME shape as the `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
floor the heap and cap roots carry; here over the program byte-fold). With it, a forger cannot escape
coverage by swapping in a hollow declaration. -/

/-- **The declaration-commitment binding floor.** Two declarations with the SAME commitment re-derive
the SAME required tags. The collision-resistance of `compute_authority_digest_felt` over the program
field (equal authority digests ⟹ equal declared `state_constraints` ⟹ equal required tags). Stated as
a named hypothesis, never an axiom — the analog of `Poseidon2SpongeCR`. -/
def DeclCommitBinds {Decl C : Type} (declCommit : Decl → C) (requiredTags : Decl → List Tag) : Prop :=
  ∀ d d' : Decl, declCommit d = declCommit d' → requiredTags d = requiredTags d'

/-- **THE SOUNDNESS CORE.** A turn on a capacity cell whose COMMITTED declaration requires tag `t`
is REJECTED if the manifest omits `t` — WHATEVER declaration the prover presents, so long as it hits
the committed declaration's commitment (which the ~124-bit wide commit forces). The forger cannot
dodge by presenting a hollow declaration: `DeclCommitBinds` makes the presented declaration's
required tags equal the committed one's, and then `omission_rejected` bites. This is the gate made
omission-proof, not prover-optional. -/

  rw [hbinds presented committed hcommit]
  -- Now `t` is required by the committed declaration; omission rejects.
  exact omission_rejected t (requiredTags committed) hreq m homit

/-- The hollow-declaration corollary in its starkest form: a forger that presents a declaration
requiring NOTHING (`requiredTags presented = []`) to dodge coverage cannot also match the committed
commitment when the committed declaration genuinely requires `t` — the two facts are contradictory
under the binding floor. So the empty-declaration dodge is impossible. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE ESCROW BRIDGE: the abstract `satisfied` bit IS the §6 `SettleGate`.

The `satisfied` bit is the verifier's verdict; here we pin it to the genuine sealed-escrow gate so

produces a covered tag-17 entry: the entry is present and its gate verdict is `true` (by the §6

/-- **PARTIAL SETTLE IS NOT COVERED.** A forged partial settle (leg B left `Deposited`) produces a

cover — coverage then rejects the turn via `unsatisfied_rejected`. The half-open trade cannot be
laundered through the manifest. -/
