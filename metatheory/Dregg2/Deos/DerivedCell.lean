# Dregg2.Deos.DerivedCell — a derived/relational cell's committed value EQUALS `f(sources)` (the
materialized-view house-capacity, grounded BY REUSE of the committed-heap root).

`cell/src/derived.rs` is the Rust house-capacity: a cell whose committed state IS a verifiable
function of OTHER cells' committed states (`Σ balances`, a field-sum, a count, a filter-then-sum) —
a light-client-checkable materialized view. Its soundness is *forge/stale rejection*: a derived
cell is sound iff its committed **claimed value** equals the derivation **evaluated over its
sources**; a forged claim (claim ≠ `f(sources)`) and a stale claim (sources moved, claim did not)
are rejected by the SAME check.

This module is the Lean RUNG for that capacity, in the shape `cae5b2fe` set for the MEMBRANE: add
the invariant leg, prove it **by reuse** of an already-proven commitment (here `Substrate.Heap`'s
sorted-Poseidon2 root), exhibit both-polarity `#guard` witnesses, `#assert_all_clean`, and wire the
Rust to it (`cell/src/derived.rs::tests::invariant_matches_lean_rung`).

## What is proven — and what it REUSES (no derived-cell-local commitment)

The derived cell binds two facts into its committed heap (the SAME `set_heap`/`compute_heap_root`
sorted-Poseidon2 map `cell/src/derived.rs` writes, folded into the canonical state commitment with
NO VK bump): a SPEC DIGEST (which derivation) at `keyDigest`, and the CLAIMED VALUE at `keyValue`.
A verifier holding the cell's committed heap, the spec, and the sources recomputes `f(sources)` and
checks it equals the committed claim. The rung proves:

  * `bind_verifies` (HONEST ROUND-TRIP) — re-deriving (`bind`) writes the freshly-folded value, so a
    verifier with the SAME spec and sources accepts. Read-after-write is `Heap.hget_hset_self`
    (crypto-free); the digest slot survives the value write by `Heap.hget_hset_frame` (the ONE named
    `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor — the cap-root floor, reused).

  * `forged_value_rejected` (THE FORGE TOOTH) — a cell whose committed claim ≠ `f(sources)` does NOT
    verify. The `cell/src/derived.rs` `forged_value_is_rejected` (claim 999 over Σ = 350), as a
    theorem.

  * `stale_rejected` (THE STALE TOOTH) — a cell honestly derived at `oldSrcs`, verified against
    `newSrcs` whose fold differs, is rejected by the SAME value check. The Rust
    `stale_after_source_change_is_rejected`, as the forge tooth instantiated at a moved source.

  * `wrong_spec_rejected` / `wrong_spec_after_bind` — a cell bound under spec A cannot be
    re-interpreted as deriving under a different spec B (distinct digest). The Rust
    `wrong_spec_is_rejected`.

  * **`claim_bound_in_root` (THE REUSE KEYSTONE)** — equal committed roots ⟹ equal committed claim:
    the claimed derived value is bound into the heap root, so a verifier (and a light client) sees
    the SAME claim the cell committed. A DIRECT instance of `Heap.root_binds_get` — the
    `cell/src/derived.rs` `claim_is_bound_into_commitment` test, as a theorem. With it,
    `forged_claim_moves_root` (the anti-ghost): a forged claim CANNOT keep the honest root — it must
    publish a different one, where the value tooth then bites. `spec_bound_in_root` is the twin for
    the spec slot.

This is NOT new mathematics: the fold `f` is an ordinary list aggregate, and the BINDING is the
proven sorted-Poseidon2 root (`Substrate.Heap`, the cap-root machinery generalized to a generic
leaf). The derived cell is a NAMING of "a committed-heap binding whose value slot equals a fold over
sources" — exactly as the membrane is a naming of iterated kernel attenuation.

## The named follow-up (VK-affecting, NOT forced here)

This rung grounds the EXECUTOR-witnessed invariant: a verifier WITH the sources rejects forges and
staleness. Binding the constraint `claim == f(sources)` into the EffectVM circuit — so a light
client verifying a *batch* sees the cross-cell derivation enforced as part of the proven kernel
transition (the sources' commitments as in-circuit membership witnesses) — is the VK-affecting weld
named in `metatheory/docs/HOUSE-CAPACITIES-WELD-PLAN.md` (derived row: "Medium, likely VK-affecting
— new cross-cell `DerivedEquals` constraint in the AIR"), the same lane the cap-root reshape drives.
The value tooth here is the *executor* tooth; the circuit tooth is its shadow.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` at the close. Crypto enters ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis
(the cap-root floor the heap carries), never as an axiom. NO core/heap edit — every binding is the
REAL `Substrate.Heap.hset`/`hget` and the root is the REAL `Substrate.Heap.root`.

/-! ## §1 — the derivation (the fold a derived cell's value MUST equal).

A source cell contributes a (signed) `balance` and one state `field` slot — the two scalars the Rust
`Aggregate` reads (`cell/src/derived.rs`'s `SumBalance` / `SumField`). The aggregate is a
deterministic function of the sources' committed scalars, the SAME function the binder and the
verifier compute — so a forge cannot hide in a discrepancy between them. -/

/-- A source cell's committed scalars the derivation reads: its signed `balance` and one `field`
slot. The Lean image of the bytes a light client sees for a source cell. -/

  | .filteredSumBalance t, srcs =>
      srcs.foldr (fun s acc => (if t ≤ s.balance then s.balance else 0) + acc) 0

/-- **`specDigest agg`** — a digest binding WHICH derivation a cell claims (the Lean image of
`DerivationSpec::digest`). Concretely injective on the witnesses below; the rung only needs that a
distinct spec carries a distinct digest, which the `#guard`s exhibit. -/

  | .filteredSumBalance t => 1000 + t

/-! ## §2 — a derived cell IS a committed-heap binding (REUSE of `Substrate.Heap`).

The derivation binding lives in a reserved heap collection (`cell/src/derived.rs`'s
`DERIVATION_COLL`), with the spec digest at `keyDigest` and the claimed value at `keyValue` — both
folded into the canonical state commitment by the SAME sorted-Poseidon2 `Heap.root`. We do not add a
commitment: we WRITE into the proven one. -/

  hset hash (hset hash h derivColl keyDigest (specDigest agg)) derivColl keyValue (agg.fold srcs)

/-- **`Verifies hash h agg srcs`** — the forge detector accepts: the committed spec digest matches
the supplied spec AND the committed claimed value equals the derivation evaluated over the sources.

/-! ## §3 — THE HONEST ROUND-TRIP + THE TEETH.

`bind` produces a cell the SAME spec+sources verify (round-trip); a forged claim, a stale claim, and
a wrong spec are each rejected. The forge/stale teeth are crypto-free (the value read-back); the
round-trip's digest leg rides the ONE named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (frame off the value write). -/

/-- **HONEST ROUND-TRIP.** A freshly re-derived cell verifies against the spec+sources it was bound
to. The value slot reads back by `Heap.hget_hset_self` (crypto-free); the digest slot survives the
value write by `Heap.hget_hset_frame` (the named cap-root `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor). -/

verify. `cell/src/derived.rs::forged_value_is_rejected` (claim 999 over Σ = 350), as a theorem. -/

fold differs, is rejected by the SAME value check — staleness IS a forge against the current

/-! ## §4 — THE REUSE KEYSTONE: the claim is bound into the committed root.

The claimed derived value rides the SAME sorted-Poseidon2 `Heap.root` the cap crown proves binds.
So equal committed roots open to the SAME claim (and the SAME spec) — a verifier and a light client
see EXACTLY the value the cell committed; a forge cannot present the honest root with a lying claim.
A DIRECT instance of `Heap.root_binds_get` (the anti-ghost), under the one named `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
floor. -/

/-- **THE REUSE KEYSTONE — the claimed value is bound into the committed root.** Two heaps with EQUAL
roots open to the SAME claimed value. The `cell/src/derived.rs::claim_is_bound_into_commitment`

/-- **THE ANTI-GHOST.** A forged cell whose committed claim differs from the honest one CANNOT keep
the honest root — it must publish a different root (where the forge tooth then bites). The
contrapositive of `claim_bound_in_root`: there is no honest way to present a different claim under
the same commitment. -/
