# Market.DarkAmmBoundReceipt — exact-opening-required hosted AMM transition.

This file is the Lean semantic model for the versioned v3 host boundary.  A
HidingFri proof-only v2 request is not enough: acceptance additionally consumes
an explicit exact-opening capability whose public claim pins the hosted
session/sequence, the complete private-receipt statement, both ciphertext
identities, both public wrap-safety bounds, the configured authority
roster/verifier/tier/threshold, and the exact fresh replay slot.

The capability is deliberately a premise, not a theorem that BFV,
HidingFri, or Ed25519 is sound.  `CipherOpensTo` is an uninterpreted relation,
and `verifiedMeaning` explicitly carries the semantic refinement which an
external same-opening authority must establish.  The independent encrypted
candidate gate is likewise represented by `DarkAmmDecisionReceipt.TrustedMeaning`;
no signature bit is promoted into that meaning inside Lean.
