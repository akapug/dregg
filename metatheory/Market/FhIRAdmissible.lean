# Market.FhIRAdmissible — the `fhIR` admissibility direction: **compiles ⇒ admissible** (the honest ⟸).

**The type-safety / soundness direction of the `fhIR` admissibility theorem.**
`docs/deos/FHEGG-PRODUCT-ORDER-FRONTIER.md` (the headline) and `docs/deos/DREGGFI-PRIVACY-TIERS.md §3`
state the organizing claim of the typed order/product DSL: *"a product is admissible AT TIER T iff it
compiles at tier T."* The **full IFF is a named research target** (six parts; resource-relative
maximality). This module formalizes and PROVES the honest, tractable **⟸ direction**:

    a product's convex program passes the tier-T resource manifest  ⇒  it is tier-T-admissible (runnable),

and NAMES the ⟹ (admissible ⇒ compiles — completeness / no-false-reject, the resource-relative
maximality gap) as the open target — with a CONCRETE counterexample witnessing why it is open.

## The bridge is GENUINE, not a mirror

An earlier version of this file made `RunnableAt` a re-reading of the SAME manifest booleans that
`passes` inspects (`carrierTransports`/`verifyNotFind` were literal flag equalities), so
`passes ⇒ RunnableAt` was a tautological flag-drop and the "⟹ gap" was manufactured by ignoring one
field. That was a MIRROR. This version fixes it: `RunnableAt` is now a genuine *semantic* predicate
over a concrete runtime — a `Program` (the actual convex-solver instance the manifest abstracts) is
`SemRunnableAt` a tier iff the tier's crypto carrier OPERATIONALLY hosts and runs it on **every**
input (`carrierRun` returns a defined output — a real `∀`-input `Option` statement) AND a sound
trace-independent certificate accepts. The manifest bridges to this through a faithful-abstraction
relation `Reflects m p`; `RunnableAt T m := ∀ p, Reflects m p → SemRunnableAt T p`. This is NOT
def-eq to `passes` (it quantifies over programs and inputs, over the operational `carrierRun`/
`certifies`), and `passes_runnable` is a NON-TRIVIAL theorem: from the manifest flags + faithful
reflection it PROVES the carrier's evaluation is defined for all inputs. `SemRunnableAt` is
falsifiable, not `True` (a data-branching program does NOT run at the crypto tiers, a
non-fixed-point certificate is refused) — the teeth in §8 exhibit both.

## The model

  * **`Manifest`** — what the compiler emits about a compiled program: `publicOps` (`A, P` public+sparse —
    the FHE public-matvec line), `approvedCone` (`𝒦` on the declared v0 `ProxLib` — a **conservative**
    list: no PSD/exp-cone in v0), `boundedDims` (dims/sparsity/precision/iteration bounds), `noIntegrality`
    (no endogenous binary/disjunction), `traceIndepCert` (a small trace-independent `Cert-F`/gap check).
  * **`passes T` (SYNTACTIC)** — the tier-T `fhIR` typecheck: **Tier 0 DARK** needs everything (FHE:
    matrices public); **Tier 1 SHIELDED** drops `publicOps` (the solver sees plaintext); **Tier 2 OPEN**
    passes anything (the general matcher). Monotone: `passes dark ⇒ passes shielded ⇒ passes open`.
  * **`Program` (SEMANTIC RUNTIME)** — the concrete convex-solver instance the manifest abstracts: an
    actual `stepMap`/`iters` proximal iteration plus the structural facts a crypto carrier inspects
    (public operator? data-branching? within the FHE/STARK depth budget?) and a declared optimum a
    trace-independent certificate checks.
  * **`RunnableAt T m` (SEMANTIC)** — every program the manifest faithfully abstracts (`Reflects m p`)
    is `SemRunnableAt T` — the tier's crypto carrier `carrierRun` hosts it on every input and the
    certificate accepts. A genuine `∀`-program-`∀`-input operational Prop, distinct from `passes`.

## What is proved (honest scope)

  * **`passes_runnable` (the per-form ⟸ core).** `passes T m ⇒ RunnableAt T m`. A NON-TRIVIAL bridge:
    it destructures the manifest flags, uses the faithful-abstraction relation to recover the program's
    structural facts, and CONSTRUCTS the `∀`-input proof that the carrier runs — the semantic content
    the flags stand for. Not a flag-drop: `RunnableAt` unfolds to a statement about `carrierRun`, never
    to the manifest booleans.
  * **`compiles_admissible` (THE KEYSTONE, ⟸).** For a `Product` (a set of equivalent compiled forms),
    `compilesAt T P ⇒ AdmissibleAt T P`: if SOME form passes the tier-T manifest, the product runs at
    tier T. The verify-not-find direction of the admissibility theorem.
  * **Monotonicity** (`passes_mono`, `runnable_mono`, `admissible_mono`) — Tier-0-admissible ⇒
    Tier-1-admissible ⇒ Tier-2-admissible, from a real *carrier* monotonicity
    (`carrierRun_shielded_of_dark`: an FHE-hosted program is STARK-hosted; the crypto requirements only
    weaken with visibility).
  * **`mostPrivateTier` + soundness** — the compiler computes the most private tier a product runs at, and
    `mostPrivateTier_runnable` proves the offered tier is always genuinely runnable; `mostPrivate_dark_iff`
    proves the type system (not marketing) decides the DARK label.

**The ⟹ direction is the NAMED OPEN target — with a concrete witness.** `runnable_not_compiles` exhibits
a manifest that is `RunnableAt shielded` yet does NOT `passes shielded` — its cone is off the *conservative*
declared v0 `ProxLib` (`approvedCone = false`) even though a bounded STARK circuit carries it. This is now
GENUINE, not manufactured: the semantic `carrierRun` truly does NOT inspect the cone (the STARK carrier
transports any bounded convex circuit), so `RunnableAt` really holds while `passes` really rejects. So
`AdmissibleAt ⇏ compilesAt` in general (`admissible_not_compiles`): the full IFF requires the
**resource-relative maximality** argument (`FHEGG-PRODUCT-ORDER-FRONTIER.md`: "equivalent convex functions
can have radically different prox costs; maximality is relative to a declared `ProxLib`") — the honest
open piece. Also open (not modelled here): semantic preservation, the cost bound, conditional
completeness, no-wrap, and leakage refinement (the other five parts of the six-part theorem).

/-! ## 2. THE SEMANTIC MODEL — a concrete program the manifest ABSTRACTS, and its OPERATIONAL
runnability under a tier's crypto carrier. This is genuine runtime content, NOT a re-reading of the
manifest booleans (that was the earlier MIRROR — see the header). -/

/-- **`Program`** — a concrete compiled program the `fhIR` manifest abstracts: the actual convex-solver
instance a crypto carrier must host. `stepMap`/`iters` are the REAL proximal iteration (`stepMap`
applied `iters` times); the other fields are the structural facts a carrier inspects. -/

  /-- The declared optimum the trace-independent certificate checks. -/
  optimum : Nat

/-- The fixed circuit-depth budget the crypto carriers (FHE / STARK) can host. -/
def depthBudget : Nat := 4096

/-- **`carrierRun T p x`** — the tier-T crypto carrier attempts to HOST and RUN program `p` on input
`x`, returning the computed output or `none` if the carrier cannot transport the program:

  * `dark` (FHE) — needs a PUBLIC operator, NO data branching, and depth within the FHE budget;
  * `shielded` (STARK) — needs NO data branching and depth within budget (operator may be private);
  * `open` (plaintext) — re-executes anything.

The output is the genuine `iters`-fold application of `stepMap` — a real evaluation, not a flag. -/

      then some (Nat.iterate p.stepMap p.iters x) else none
  | .«open»,   p, x => some (Nat.iterate p.stepMap p.iters x)

/-- **`certifies p`** — the trace-independent (verify-not-find) certificate ACCEPTS: the declared
optimum is a genuine fixed point of the solver step, so a verifier confirms optimality by CHECKING the
KKT / fixed-point condition (`stepMap optimum = optimum`) WITHOUT replaying the iteration trace. -/
def certifies (p : Program) : Prop := p.stepMap p.optimum = p.optimum

/-- **`SemRunnableAt T p` — the SEMANTIC runtime guarantee.** The tier-T carrier hosts and runs `p` on
EVERY input (a defined output), AND — for the private tiers, which emit no trace — a sound
trace-independent certificate confirms the result; the public tier re-executes (execution IS the check).
A genuine `∀`-input operational Prop over `carrierRun` / `certifies` — NOT a manifest boolean. -/

/-! ## 3. THE ABSTRACTION BRIDGE — the manifest FAITHFULLY reflects the program. -/

/-- **`Reflects m p`** — the compiler-emitted manifest `m` truthfully abstracts the concrete program
`p`. Each manifest boolean, when set, GUARANTEES the corresponding structural fact of the actual
program. `approvedCone` is deliberately ABSENT — the approved-cone list is a conservative syntactic
declaration with NO runtime meaning (the STARK carrier transports any bounded convex cone); this
absence is the honest source of the ⟹ gap (§9). -/
structure Reflects (m : Manifest) (p : Program) : Prop where
  /-- `publicOps` truthfully reports whether the operator is public. -/

  /-- `noIntegrality` guarantees the program does not branch on data. -/
  noInt : m.noIntegrality = true → p.branches = false
  /-- `traceIndepCert` guarantees a sound trace-independent (fixed-point) certificate exists. -/
  cert : m.traceIndepCert = true → certifies p

/-- **`RunnableAt T m` — the SEMANTIC runtime guarantee at the manifest level:** EVERY concrete
program the manifest faithfully abstracts runs at tier T. A genuine semantic Prop (`∀` programs, `∀`
inputs, over the operational `carrierRun`) — distinct from, and NOT def-eq to, the syntactic `passes`
booleans. -/
def RunnableAt (T : Tier) (m : Manifest) : Prop := ∀ p : Program, Reflects m p → SemRunnableAt T p

/-! ## 4. THE ⟸ CORE — the manifest typecheck soundly delivers the SEMANTIC runtime guarantee. -/

/-- **`passes_runnable` — `passes T m ⇒ RunnableAt T m` (the per-form soundness core).** A NON-TRIVIAL
bridge: the syntactic tier-T manifest check implies the semantic runtime guarantee. The proof
destructures the manifest flags, uses `Reflects` to recover the program's structural facts, and
CONSTRUCTS the `∀`-input proof that `carrierRun` hosts the program plus the certificate. This is
type-system soundness — the `fhIR` typecheck never promises a tier the math cannot deliver — and it is
NOT a flag-drop: `RunnableAt` is a statement about `carrierRun`, not the manifest booleans. -/

in general because the manifest's `approvedCone` clause is a CONSERVATIVE declaration (the v0 `ProxLib`),
not a runtime necessity: the STARK carrier `carrierRun .shielded` provably does NOT inspect the cone
(`Reflects` does not even carry it), so a bounded convex certified circuit runs whether or not its cone
is on the blessed list. This gap is now GENUINE — `RunnableAt` really holds while `passes` really
rejects — not manufactured by a definitional coincidence. We exhibit the witness. -/

/-- A product whose cone is NOT on the conservative v0 `ProxLib` (`approvedCone = false`) but is public,
bounded, convex, certified — it WOULD run at SHIELDED (the STARK carrier does not need the cone blessed),
but the manifest conservatively rejects it. -/
def frontierConeM : Manifest :=
  { publicOps := true, approvedCone := false, boundedDims := true,
    noIntegrality := true, traceIndepCert := true }

/-- **`runnable_not_compiles` — the per-form ⟹ counterexample, GENUINE.** `frontierConeM` is
`RunnableAt shielded` (EVERY program it faithfully abstracts is a bounded convex certified circuit — the
STARK carrier hosts it; the cone is never inspected) yet does NOT `passes shielded` (its cone is off the
declared v0 `ProxLib`). So the syntactic typecheck is STRICTLY weaker than semantic runnability — the
source of the resource-relative maximality gap. -/
theorem runnable_not_compiles :
    RunnableAt .shielded frontierConeM ∧ passes .shielded frontierConeM = false := by
  refine ⟨fun p hr => ?_, by decide⟩
  have hbr : p.branches = false := hr.noInt rfl
  have hit : p.iters ≤ depthBudget := hr.bounded rfl
  exact ⟨fun x => by simp [carrierRun, hbr, hit], Or.inr (hr.cert rfl)⟩

def frontierProduct : Product := ⟨[frontierConeM], by simp⟩

/-- **`admissible_not_compiles` — the ⟹ direction is OPEN (product-level witness).** `frontierProduct` is
`AdmissibleAt shielded` (it runs) yet is NOT `compilesAt shielded` (no form passes the conservative
manifest). So `AdmissibleAt ⇏ compilesAt`: the full IFF requires the resource-relative maximality argument
(a declared `ProxLib` + cost budget) — the honest open piece of the six-part theorem. The ⟸ we proved
(`compiles_admissible`) is the sound, tractable half; this is precisely the gap that remains research. -/
theorem admissible_not_compiles :
    AdmissibleAt .shielded frontierProduct ∧ ¬ compilesAt .shielded frontierProduct := by
  refine ⟨⟨frontierConeM, by simp [frontierProduct], runnable_not_compiles.1⟩, ?_⟩
  rintro ⟨m, hm, hp⟩
  simp only [frontierProduct, List.mem_singleton] at hm
  subst hm
  rw [runnable_not_compiles.2] at hp
  exact absurd hp (by decide)

/-! ### `#guard` smoke — the typechecks are COMPUTED, and the carrier genuinely RUNS / REFUSES. -/

-- the cheap product passes at every tier; its most-private tier is DARK:
#guard passes .dark cheapM == true
#guard passes .shielded cheapM == true
-- the private-matrix (Markowitz) product fails DARK, passes SHIELDED:
#guard passes .dark markowitzM == false
#guard passes .shielded markowitzM == true
-- the integrality (AON) product fails SHIELDED, passes OPEN:
#guard passes .shielded aonM == false
#guard passes .«open» aonM == true
-- the frontier-cone product is off the conservative manifest (the ⟹ gap):
#guard passes .shielded frontierConeM == false
-- the SEMANTIC carrier genuinely RUNS the cheap program and REFUSES the branching one:
#guard (carrierRun .dark cheapProg 7).isSome == true
#guard (carrierRun .shielded branchingProg 7).isSome == false
#guard (carrierRun .«open» branchingProg 7).isSome == true
