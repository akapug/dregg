# Market.ProtocolAssurance — the honest STARK ↔ Market ↔ settlement seam.

`Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundness` and the Market tower were previously imported by the same root file,
but no theorem connected them.  In particular, an accepted batch exposed only
`(effect, pre, post, turn)`, while `DrexClearing` was handed directly to `settleDrex`; neither the STARK
extractor nor a modeled settlement-proof verifier produced that clearing.

This module makes the seam explicit without inventing it:

* `MarketBoundaryBinding` is the smallest faithful endpoint relation: the accepted batch's public roots
  are exactly the commitments of a real `DrexClearing`.  Commitment binding then forces the decoded
  STARK endpoints to be that clearing's endpoints.
* `MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing` is the maximally narrow endpoint fact: the kernel endpoints of a
  step extracted for the designated effect are realized by a proof-carrying clearing.  The ordinary
  STARK extraction, witness decode, and commitment binding are no longer hidden in a second accept-level
  hypothesis; the theorems below invoke `lightclient_unfoolable` themselves.
* `DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual` names the strictly stronger fact still absent: the clearing's
  exact allocation lowers to the ordinary balance-action list that the extracted step denotes.  This
  distinction prevents endpoint equivalence from being mislabeled as trace/allocation identity.
* `starkMarketClaimExtraction_of_effect_step`, `lightclient_market_seam`, and
  `accepted_market_settles_on_same_commitment_surface` prove everything above that exact descriptor
  fact: the decoded STARK transition is the fair, kernel-real clearing; it conserves every asset; and
  the cross-chain register advances from the same pre-commitment to the same post-commitment.
* `SettlementVerifierRefines` names the second missing theorem.  The current `settleDrex` consumes a
  pre-proved `DrexClearing` and models only continuity plus register update.  The deployed Groth16
  verifier consumes bytes.  Its soundness must imply existence of the `DrexClearing` whose roots and
  turn count it accepted.

The repaired cross-chain witness is also shown to satisfy `AccountsWF`, the structural invariant
required by `StateDecode`.  Previously its `cell` function was non-default outside `{1,2}`, so the
Market demo could not inhabit the light-client boundary at all.

At HEAD the single-effect dispatcher has no `DrexClearing` constructor: a clearing contains at least
two settlement legs, while `BatchPublicInputs.effect` selects one `FullActionA`.  The operated DrEX
path lowers a clearing to a list of ordinary effects, but that list/allocation is not part of this
single-effect apex.  Therefore the final descriptor/whole-turn extraction remains named precisely
below; it cannot honestly be manufactured from the four public-input fields.

Pure.  No axioms; the two missing links remain named propositions.

/-! ## 3. The precisely named Market-effect semantic extraction. -/

/-- **The maximal endpoint-level fragment at the current apex.**  The designated single effect's
kernel endpoints admit a fair, kernel-real clearing.  Because `DrexClearing.settled` executes the
allocation's settlement list, this is a real state-transition statement, but it deliberately does NOT
claim that the single `FullActionA` retained the allocation identity. -/
def MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing (marketEffect : EffectIdx) : Prop :=
  ∀ (pre post : RecChainedState), dispatchArm marketEffect pre post →
    ∃ c : DrexClearing, c.pre = pre.kernel ∧ c.post = post.kernel

abbrev MarketEffectEndpointExtractionResidual := MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing

/-- The exact ordinary effect list induced by a clearing allocation. -/
def clearingActions (c : DrexClearing) : List FullActionA :=
  (settlementsOf c.nodes).map fun l => .balanceA l.toTurn l.asset

/-- **`DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual` (OPEN):** the missing per-effect/whole-turn descriptor
theorem.  Besides matching kernel endpoints, the extracted step must denote the exact list of ordinary
balance effects lowered from `c.nodes`; thus the allocation, not merely its final roots, is retained.

A faithful implementation can discharge this by adding a genuine clearing action whose descriptor
carries the allocation, or by lifting the apex to the emitted effect list.  At HEAD a public input names
one `FullActionA`, so this statement is named and not fabricated.

TRIAGE (2026-07-15, `assurance-audit`): the fair allocation is NOT trusted — it is CIRCUIT-ENFORCED. The
deployed `circuit-prove/src/shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs` binds each leg's cleared offer to a spent member
note by an in-circuit `connect` (forged leg ⇒ UNSAT), enforces the matching descriptor, nullifier
distinctness, and BOTH coordinate + range-checked INTEGER conservation; and `LedgerRealizationExt.
shielded_ring_fused_clears` proves the `CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring that settles via `settleRing` is
conserving + `RingBalanced`-fair + fused. So this residual is NOT a trust hole — it is exactly two named,
concrete bridges:
  (1) THE LOWERING — `settleRing k (settlementsOf c.nodes) = some k'` ⟹ `turnSpec ⟨k,…⟩ (clearingActions c)
      ⟨k',…⟩`. Both are folds over the same `settlementsOf c.nodes`: `settleRing` (`Intent/Ring.lean:94`)
      folds `recKExecAsset s l.toTurn l.asset`; `turnSpec` folds `fullActionStep`, whose `.balanceA` arm is
      `BalanceMovementSpec`. So (1) reduces to the CONCRETE per-step lemma
      `recKExecAsset s l.toTurn l.asset = some s' ⟹ BalanceMovementSpec ⟨s,…⟩ l.toTurn l.asset ⟨s',…⟩`
      (the non-facet analog of `RotatedKernelRefinementFacet:131`, which does NOT yet exist — the concrete
      first piece), plus induction on the settlement list and the `RecChainedState` wrapping (balance moves
      touch only `.kernel`, so the non-kernel fields carry).
  (2) THE APEX-LIFT — the single-effect dispatch must extract the whole `CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring, not
      one `FullActionA` (the `shielded_ring_clearing_air` refinement into the Lean ring). -/
def MarketEffectAllocationIdentity (marketEffect : EffectIdx) : Prop :=
  ∀ (pre post : RecChainedState), dispatchArm marketEffect pre post →
    ∃ c : DrexClearing,
      c.pre = pre.kernel ∧ c.post = post.kernel ∧
      turnSpec pre (clearingActions c) post

abbrev DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual := MarketEffectAllocationIdentity

/-- Exact allocation refinement implies the endpoint fragment used by the current commitment-surface
composition.  The converse is intentionally absent. -/

/-- The historical outward statement: for the registry's designated Market effect, an accepted STARK
extracts a real `DrexClearing` whose executor endpoints are the public roots.

This is stronger than importing both towers and weaker than revealing the private order book.  The
clearing can remain existential/zero-knowledge; its `valid`, `wantPos`, and `settled` proofs ensure
fairness and kernel-real conservation.  It is retained as the convenient outward interface, but the
theorem below derives it from the ordinary STARK floors plus only the narrowly named
`MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing` descriptor fact. -/

trace and decoded kernel step; the sole Market-specific input is that the designated step's endpoints
admit a proof-carrying clearing.  Commitment roots are inherited from `StateDecode` rather than assumed
by the Market fact.  Allocation identity remains the stronger named residual above. -/
