# Market.ProtocolAssurance — the honest STARK ↔ Market ↔ settlement seam.

`Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundness` and the Market tower were previously imported by the same root file,
but no theorem connected them.  In particular, an accepted batch exposed only
`(effect, pre, post, turn)`, while `DrexClearing` was handed directly to `settleDrex`; neither the STARK
extractor nor a modeled settlement-proof verifier produced that clearing.

This module makes the seam explicit without inventing it:

* `MarketBoundaryBinding` is the smallest faithful endpoint relation: the accepted batch's public roots
  are exactly the commitments of a real `DrexClearing`.  Commitment binding then forces the decoded
  STARK endpoints to be that clearing's endpoints.
* `MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing` is the maximally narrow endpoint fact: the kernel endpoints of a
  step extracted for the designated effect are realized by a proof-carrying clearing.  The ordinary
  STARK extraction, witness decode, and commitment binding are no longer hidden in a second accept-level
  hypothesis; the theorems below invoke `lightclient_unfoolable` themselves.
* The exact clearing-allocation lowering is now proved by `drexClearing_refines_turnSpec`.
  `DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual` reduces to the one fact still absent: the apex descriptor must
  retain/extract the fused ring and its endpoints rather than erase it to one arbitrary action.
* `starkMarketClaimExtraction_of_effect_step`, `lightclient_market_seam`, and
  `accepted_market_settles_on_same_commitment_surface` prove everything above that exact descriptor
  fact: the decoded STARK transition is the fair, kernel-real clearing; it conserves every asset; and
  the cross-chain register advances from the same pre-commitment to the same post-commitment.
* `SettlementVerifier25Refines` names the second missing theorem over the exact canonical 25-lane ABI.
  The current `settleDrex` consumes a pre-proved `DrexClearing` and models only continuity plus register
  update.  Groth16 soundness must imply existence of the clearing whose eight-lane roots and turn count
  it accepted; the byte packing below is no longer generic prose.

The repaired cross-chain witness is also shown to satisfy `AccountsWF`, the structural invariant
required by `StateDecode`.  Previously its `cell` function was non-default outside `{1,2}`, so the
Market demo could not inhabit the light-client boundary at all.

At HEAD the single-effect dispatcher has no `DrexClearing` constructor: a clearing contains at least
two settlement legs, while `BatchPublicInputs.effect` selects one `FullActionA`.  The direct ring-
descriptor route below has the right theorem shape, but the current six-lane note apex omits creators,
kernel endpoints, turn count, and receipt-chain output.  Therefore only that endpoint-carrying
descriptor/whole-turn extraction remains named; it cannot be manufactured from the note claim.

Pure.  No axioms; the two missing links remain named propositions.

/-! ## 1a. The concrete settlement-list lowering.

There is one important guard distinction at this seam.  `settleRing` folds the kernel-only
`recKExecAsset`, whereas the ordinary `.balanceA` action uses `recCexecAsset`: the latter additionally
requires the destination to be Live and prepends the movement receipt to `RecChainedState.log`.
Consequently the standalone implication from a raw kernel step to `BalanceMovementSpec` is false
without the destination-liveness premise.  A successfully settled *cycle* supplies that premise:
every receiver is another leg's sender, and every successfully executing sender is Live.  The lemmas
below make those two facts explicit and then perform the exact fold, including the receipt log. -/

/-- The receipt-chain suffix produced by executing a ring left-to-right.  Each action prepends its
receipt, so the final log contains the ring's turns in reverse execution order before the old log. -/

/-- A committed raw per-asset step forces its source lifecycle to be Live.  This is the seventh
conjunct of `recKExecAsset`'s real acceptance guard, retained here because the older public
`recKExecAsset_committed` projection deliberately exposes only its first six conjuncts. -/

/-- **`DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual` (OPEN):** the missing per-effect/whole-turn descriptor
theorem.  Besides matching kernel endpoints, the extracted step must denote the exact list of ordinary
balance effects lowered from `c.nodes`; thus the allocation, not merely its final roots, is retained.

A faithful implementation can discharge this by adding a genuine clearing action whose descriptor
carries the allocation, or by lifting the apex to the emitted effect list.  At HEAD a public input names
one `FullActionA`, so this statement is named and not fabricated.

TRIAGE (2026-07-15, `assurance-audit`): the fair allocation is NOT trusted — it is CIRCUIT-ENFORCED. The
deployed `circuit-prove/src/shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs` binds each leg's cleared offer to a spent member
note by an in-circuit `connect` (forged leg ⇒ UNSAT), enforces the matching descriptor, nullifier
distinctness, and BOTH coordinate + range-checked INTEGER conservation; and `LedgerRealizationExt.
shielded_ring_fused_clears` proves the `CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring that settles via `settleRing` is
conserving + `RingBalanced`-fair + fused.

The LOWERING is now CLOSED by `drexClearing_refines_turnSpec`.  The raw per-leg implication originally
suggested here was slightly too weak: `recKExecAsset` omits the chained destination-liveness gate and
receipt append.  `recKExecAsset_refines_balanceMovement` states the exact step; cycle closure plus whole-
ring success derive destination liveness, and `settleRing_refines_turnSpec` performs the fold with the
exact reverse-prepended receipt log.

The sole remaining bridge is the APEX-LIFT: the verifying descriptor must extract the whole
`CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring and its kernel endpoints, not one `FullActionA`.  The current Rust-authored
`shielded-ring-clear-2` leaf cannot discharge that proposition: its public claim is exactly the six
note lanes `[nf₀,root₀,vb₀,nf₁,root₁,vb₁]`; neither creator, eight-lane kernel pre/post commitments,
turn count, authorization/lifecycle state, nor receipt-chain output is present.  It proves the hidden-
note fusion/cycle/conservation algebra, but not an executor transition.  Closure therefore requires a
Lean-authored endpoint-carrying outer descriptor (architectural law #1), binding these note rows to the
two ordinary balance actions and the batch's decoded pre/post commitment surface. -/

/-- The historical outward statement: for the registry's designated Market effect, an accepted STARK
extracts a real `DrexClearing` whose executor endpoints are the public roots.

This is stronger than importing both towers and weaker than revealing the private order book.  The
clearing can remain existential/zero-knowledge; its `valid`, `wantPos`, and `settled` proofs ensure
fairness and kernel-real conservation.  It is retained as the convenient outward interface, but the
theorem below derives it from the ordinary STARK floors plus only the narrowly named
`MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing` descriptor fact. -/

/-! ### The direct shielded-descriptor route.

The generic single-action `dispatchArm` is not needed once the market registry entry itself refines to
`ShieldedRingApexStep`.  This is the faithful apex shape for a ring descriptor: STARK extraction gives
its satisfying trace, state decode gives the committed endpoints, and the descriptor theorem gives the
whole fused clearing. -/
