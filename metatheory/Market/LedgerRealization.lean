# Market.LedgerRealization — DrEX: WELDING the priced tower (rung 5) to the REAL kernel executor.

**The seam this closes (named by the scope audit, `docs/deos/DREX-DESIGN.md` §2/§6 and
`DREGGFI-VISION.md` §7, committed in `03a5bad91`).** DrEX's rungs split into two grades of
groundedness:

  * **rung 1 (`Market/{Clearing,Fairness}.lean`) is LEDGER-REALIZED** — its conservation is the REAL
    executor's. `cycleValid_fulfilled_respects_limits` is stated over `settleRing k (settlementsOf ns)
    = some k'` and asserts `recTotalAsset k' b = recTotalAsset k b` (the per-asset ledger measure the
    `@[export] recKExec` FFI actually runs, `Dregg2/Intent/RingFFI.lean`);
  * **rungs 4/5/6 (`Market/{Optimality,Priced,Liquidity}.lean`) were MODEL-VERIFIED** — proved over
    the priced `Fill`/reserve MODEL (`netFlow = 0` over ℚ, `Priced.lean`), a self-contained
    bookkeeping identity NOT welded to `settleRing`/`recKExec`. The `netFlow` was a LOCAL sum, not the
    kernel's `recTotalAsset`/`toBal`.

This module drives rung 5's conservation DOWN to the kernel for the case where it cleanly lowers: the
**full-fill uniform-price clearing** (the degeneration `PricedOrder.ofMatchNode` /
`ofMatchNode_full_fill_meets_wantMin` already support — a full fill at the limit price recovers
rung-1's exact-book leg). For such a clearing over a solver-admitted cycle, the priced model's
`netFlow = 0` and the KERNEL's `recTotalAsset`-preservation are two readings of ONE settlement — the
priced conservation IS the kernel conservation.

## What is proved (and its EXACT scope)

  * **`fullFill_cycle_ledger_realized` (THE BRIDGE).** For a `CycleValid ns` whose legs are TIGHT
    (`TightCycle ns` — every sender's full offer is exactly the next party's minimum, the full-fill /
    exact-swap regime), with positive offers, that settles through the verified executor
    (`settleRing k (settlementsOf ns) = some k'`):
      1. **(kernel-real)** `∀ b, recTotalAsset k' b = recTotalAsset k b` — the REAL ledger preserves
         every asset's supply. This IS rung-1's `settleRing_conserves` tie (the same clause
         `cycleValid_fulfilled_respects_limits` carries);
      2. **(model)** `Conserves (pricedFullFills ns)` — the priced full-fill lowering has `netFlow = 0`
         over ℚ on EVERY asset, PROVED (from tightness + chaining, by the rotation reindexing
         `offerContrib_sum_eq_wantContrib_sum`), not assumed;
      3. **(model ↔ kernel)** each priced fill spends EXACTLY its kernel settlement leg's amount
         (`fullFill … .filledIn = ((settlementsOf ns).getD j default).amount`). The priced fills ARE the
         kernel legs, quantity for quantity.
    So (2) and (1) are the SAME trades (3): rung 5 is ledger-realized for the full-fill case.

  * **SCOPE, stated plainly.** This welds the **full-fill / tight-cycle** case (where the priced
    clearing recovers the `MatchNode` cycle). **Genuine partial-fill ledger-realization** — a fill
    that spends LESS than the offer, at a strictly interior price, does NOT lower to a single
    `settleRing` cycle (the settled leg amount is the RECEIVER's `wantMin`, and the ofMatchNode limit
    price only reproduces the executed rate at a full give) — that is the NEXT sub-rung, NAMED not
    claimed (`partial-fill ledger-realization`). Rung 6's portfolio `pool_solvent_forever` is a
    ∀-schedule reserve invariant over `Pool = AssetId → ℚ`, not a ring settlement, so it does NOT
    lower to `settleRing` at all — its kernel weld is a SEPARATE reserve-column readback, also NAMED.

NON-VACUITY, both polarities: a concrete TIGHT valid triangle (`tightTriangle`) has its full-fill
lowering CONSERVE (`netFlow = 0`, `#guard`-computed) with the per-leg correspondence pinned, and — the
tooth — the full-fill lowering of a NON-tight cycle (`Fairness.validTriangle`, offers 8/9/7 against
wants 4/6/5) does NOT conserve (`netFlow · 10 = -2 ≠ 0`): a full-fill of a non-tight cycle would mint
value, so it is NOT ledger-realized. Tightness is load-bearing.

Pure.

/-- **`fullFill n`** — the FULL fill of `n` at its limit price: spend the ENTIRE `offerAmount` at the
rate `ofMatchNode` carries (`limitPrice = wantMin / offerAmount`), so the fill delivers exactly `wantMin`
of `wantAsset` (`ofMatchNode_full_fill_meets_wantMin`). This is the priced Fill the exact-book leg

The rung-5 `Fill`-model image of the rung-1/2 `MatchNode` cycle `ns`. -/
def pricedFullFills (ns : List MatchNode) : List Fill := ns.map fullFill

/-- **`TightCycle ns`** — every leg is FULL: the sender's whole `offerAmount` equals the next party's
`wantMin` (the amount the kernel leg actually settles, `chainedLeg … .amount`). This is the exact-swap
regime `CycleValid`'s `wantMin ≤ offerAmount` (`cycleValid_chains`) degenerates to at equality — the
case where a full fill at the limit price reproduces the executed leg exactly. -/

`wantMin` of `wantAsset` (by `ofMatchNode_full_fill_meets_wantMin`, needs `offerAmount ≠ 0`) and spends
`offerAmount` of `offerAsset` — so its per-asset net change is the credit minus the debit. -/

/-! ## 3. THE REINDEXING — the Σ of debits equals the Σ of credits (a rotation of the cycle). -/

/-- **`offerContrib_sum_eq_wantContrib_sum` — the debit total equals the credit total.** For a tight
valid cycle, `Σ offerContrib = Σ wantContrib` on every asset. The proof is the cycle's OWN rotation:
leg `k`'s debit (`offerContrib ns[k]`) equals node `(k+1) % m`'s credit (`wantContrib ns[(k+1)%m]`) —
by `cycleValid_chains` (`offerAsset[k] = wantAsset[(k+1)%m]`, the asset matches) and `TightCycle`
(`offerAmount[k] = wantMin[(k+1)%m]`, the amount matches). So `ns.map offerContrib` is
`(ns.rotate 1).map wantContrib`, whose sum is `(ns.map wantContrib)`'s by `rotate_perm`. This is the
telescoping that makes a full-fill clearing conserve. -/

`netFlow (pricedFullFills ns) a = 0` for all `a`: the priced model neither mints nor burns. The
rung-5 `Conserves` predicate, PROVED (not assumed) for the lowering of a solver-admitted tight cycle —
the model conservation the bridge realizes on the kernel. -/

/-! ## 5. THE MODEL ↔ KERNEL CORRESPONDENCE — a priced fill spends its settlement leg's amount. -/

/-- **`fullFill_filledIn_eq_settleLeg` — the priced fill's spend IS the kernel leg's debit.** For a
tight valid cycle, node `j`'s full fill spends `offerAmount[j]`, and the `settleRing` leg `j` debits
exactly that (`chainedLeg`'s amount is the receiver's `wantMin`, which tightness equates to
`offerAmount[j]`). So the priced batch and the kernel ring move the SAME quantities — the fills ARE the
legs. -/

/-! ## 6. THE BRIDGE — the full-fill clearing is LEDGER-REALIZED on the verified executor. -/

/-- **`fullFill_cycle_ledger_realized` — THE WELD (full-fill case).** A tight valid cycle that settles
through the VERIFIED executor is realized on the real ledger:

  1. **(kernel-real)** `∀ b, recTotalAsset k' b = recTotalAsset k b` — the REAL executor preserves
     every asset's supply (`settleRing_conserves`, the SAME tie rung 1's
     `cycleValid_fulfilled_respects_limits` carries);
  2. **(model)** `Conserves (pricedFullFills ns)` — the priced full-fill lowering has `netFlow = 0`
     over ℚ (PROVED, §4);
  3. **(model ↔ kernel)** each priced fill spends EXACTLY its kernel settlement leg's amount (§5).

So the priced model's `netFlow = 0` (2) and the kernel's `recTotalAsset`-preservation (1) are two
readings of the SAME trades (3). Rung 5's conservation is LEDGER-REALIZED for the full-fill / tight
case — no longer a self-contained ℚ bookkeeping identity but the verified executor's own conservation.

SCOPE (honest): this is the full-fill / tight-cycle case only. Genuine partial fills (interior price,
spend < offer) do not lower to a single `settleRing` cycle — `partial-fill ledger-realization` is the
NAMED next sub-rung. The refusing power: a full-fill of a NON-tight cycle does NOT `Conserves`
(`nonTight_fullFill_not_conserving` below), so it is not realized. -/

/-! ## 8. NON-VACUITY, negative polarity — a full-fill of a NON-tight cycle is NOT realized. -/

/-- **TOOTH: a full-fill of a NON-tight cycle does NOT conserve.** `Fairness.validTriangle` is a valid
cycle but NOT tight (offers 8/9/7 against wants 4/6/5 — strict surplus). Filling every node to its FULL
offer would spend 8/9/7 while delivering only 4/6/5, minting/burning value: `netFlow · 10 = 6 − 8 =
−2 ≠ 0`. So the full-fill model does NOT `Conserves` a non-tight cycle — it is NOT ledger-realized.
Tightness is load-bearing; the realization refuses a non-conserving full clearing. (The kernel's OWN
settlement of `validTriangle` settles the RECEIVER's `wantMin` per leg, not the full offer — that is
the genuine partial fill this module NAMES as the next sub-rung.) -/

/-- **TOOTH: an over-debiting cycle never even forms** (echo of `Fairness.overdebit_refused`). Ring's
`underfundCycle` (node 1 demands 50 of an offer of 3) is not `CycleValid`, so no `settlementsOf` /
