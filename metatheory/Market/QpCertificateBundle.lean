# Market.QpCertificateBundle — the semantic join behind `FHQPB001`.

The transport bundle carries two independently checked objects: an SDD
admission certificate for the objective matrix and an exact KKT certificate.
Neither fact is sufficient alone.  This file states the small composition law
at their decoded rational meaning:

* the SDD witness names a matrix `admittedP`;
* the KKT witness names a `RustQpProblem`;
* `admittedP = prob.p` is an explicit, load-bearing matrix pin; and
* exact feasibility, stationarity, and normal-cone acceptance imply that the
  witness minimizes the same objective over every feasible point.

Wire parsing, fixed-point decoding, checksums, and authentication remain
outside Lean.  In particular, this theorem does not turn positive-tolerance
`rustCertQpCheck = true` into exact KKT: `rustApprox_accepts_nonexact_stationarity`
proves that implication false.  A carrier refinement may use this theorem only
after establishing the exact propositions below for its decoded values.
