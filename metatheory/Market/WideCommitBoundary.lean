# Market.WideCommitBoundary — the faithful eight-lane light-client boundary.

The generic circuit apex historically collapsed a deployed state commitment to one `ℤ`.
This module keeps the deployed shape: the commitment is the eight-felt result of the
`wireCommitR8` chain over a 178-limb kernel payload, with the receipt-log root absorbed
last.  The payload's first limb is the already-proved `CommitSurface.commit`; the
remaining 177 lanes are domain-separated headroom for the deployed layout.  Thus the
wide chain adds no new trust: `wireCommitR8_binds` recovers the entire payload and receipt
root, then `CommitSurface.commit_binds` recovers the kernel.

No axiom, `sorry`, `admit`, or native decision procedure.
