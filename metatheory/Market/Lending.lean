# Market.Lending — DrEX rung 8: UNDERCOLLATERALIZATION-IMPOSSIBLE lending (the marquee dreggfi money market).

**The Certora canonical bad state has NO CONSTRUCTOR.** Every money-market blow-up of the last cycle
(Moonwell / Euler / the xUSD bad-debt event) is one shape: a position that is *underwater*
(`collateralValue < debt · liqRatio`) **and** cannot be liquidated (the liquidation predicate lags the
mark — a governance flag, a keeper grace-window, a paused market), so the shortfall rots into protocol
bad debt. This module builds a lending lifecycle where **that state is unrepresentable**: liquidation
eligibility is not a stored, laggable flag — it is a *pure function of the mark*, DEFINED to be exactly
"underwater" (via the operational transition, `liquidatable_iff_underwater`). The
"liquidatable-but-can't-repay" bad state is therefore a contradiction, `no_bad_debt` — a theorem, not a
monitor. Mirrors `Dregg2/Storage/DealLifecycle.lean`'s "illegal steps have no constructor".

This module **COMPOSES three already-PROVED objects; it re-proves none**:

  * **SOLVENCY** — `Market.pool_solvent_forever` (`Market/Liquidity.lean`): the lending reserve
    (per-asset `Pool`) is never negative at any reachable state along ANY schedule of valid fills
    (`ScheduleValid`), the ∀-adversary object lifted from `Dregg2/Verify/StripeReserve.lean`. Reused
    verbatim as the lending pool's never-insolvent guarantee, plus `stripe_reserve_solvent_forever` as
    the disclosed backing line — the pool of collateral + loans covers all liabilities across ANY
    schedule.
  * **THE LIFECYCLE-WITH-UNREPRESENTABLE-ILLEGAL-STEPS** — `DealLifecycle.lean`'s partial-transition
    pattern (`Open → Healthy → Liquidatable → Liquidated`, every transition a `none`-guarded partial
    function, illegal steps have no constructor): terminal finality, liquidate-requires-liquidatable,
    and the totality that a position **cannot silently rot underwater**.

## The keystones

  * **(a) NO-BAD-DEBT** — `no_bad_debt`: `∀ mark r p, ¬ BadDebt mark r p`, where `BadDebt` is the
    Certora bad state `0 < debt ∧ Underwater ∧ ¬ Liquidatable`. It is uninhabited because
    liquidatability ≡ underwater-ness (`liquidatable_iff_underwater`, proved through the actual
    `liquidate` transition being available). The bad state has NO CONSTRUCTOR. Structurally, the health
    classifier `LoanHealth` has no `badDebt` bucket (`classify_exhaustive`) and `classify` is total.
  * **(b) SOLVENCY** — `lending_pool_solvent_forever` (= `pool_solvent_forever`) + the reused backing
    line: the lending pool stays solvent over ANY schedule; composed into `lending_sound`.
  * **(c) LIQUIDATION IS TOTAL** — `liquidation_total_when_underwater` / `loan_liquidation_total`:
    whenever the ratio breaks, the liquidation transition is available (returns `some`). A position
    cannot silently rot underwater — liquidation is always callable exactly when needed.

## HONEST SCOPE (the oracle edge, DREGGFI-VISION §7)

The theorem is **CONDITIONAL ON THE MARK**: every statement is `∀ (mark : Mark) …` — "GIVEN the price
feed, no bad debt". Pulling the mark itself into the model as a proof-carrying witness (the oracle weld —
the price as a ZK/attested input, §2/§7 "force it in-circuit at settlement") is the NAMED next rung; it
is NOT claimed closed here. What IS proved: given the mark, the bad-debt state is unconstructable, the
pool is solvent forever, and liquidation is always available when the ratio breaks.

A SECOND scope edge, stated plainly so `no_bad_debt` is not over-read: the `Position`/`Mark` types here
are a FRESH economic MODEL (`collateral`/`debt`/`price : Rat`), NOT welded to `RecordKernelState`/the
executor ledger; and `no_bad_debt` holds because `Liquidatable` is DEFINED as a pure function of the mark
(`liquidatable_iff_underwater`: `Liquidatable` = `Underwater` by construction). So the theorem's content
is that a design in which eligibility is a pure function of the mark — NO stored, laggable flag — cannot
express the bad state; it is a faithful encoding of that design PRINCIPLE, NOT an operational proof that
an executor carrying a stored flag cannot desync from an oracle. It is non-vacuous (the `Underwater`
domain is inhabited: `demo_bad_debt_needs_only_unliquidatable` pins 2/3 conjuncts holding at the crash),
but "no constructor" is a modeling consequence of the pure-function choice, not an executor-welded
impossibility. The SOLVENCY half (`lending_pool_solvent_forever`) IS the rung-6 grounded-`Pool` model
reused; `lending_sound` conjoins the two (they share no state).

NON-VACUITY both polarities: a healthy position across an adversarial PRICE CRASH stays no-bad-debt and
the pool stays solvent (`demo_no_bad_debt_across_crash`, `lending_demo_solvent`; the values/marks are
`#guard`/theorem-pinned) — and the position goes healthy→liquidatable but liquidation is always available
(never bad debt); AND the teeth — the bad state is unconstructable (`bad_debt_unconstructable`, and the
only missing piece is the *impossible* unliquidatability, `demo_bad_debt_needs_only_unliquidatable`), an
under-collateralized origination is REFUSED (`undercollateralized_origination_refused`,
`demo_undercollateralized_refused`), and a healthy position cannot be liquidated
(`liquidate_none_when_healthy`). Mirrors the rung teeth.

/-- **A lending position** — collateral posted and outstanding debt (numeraire). Note there is NO
`liquidatable`/`healthy` FIELD: health is DERIVED from the mark, never a storable, laggable flag. That
absence is the whole point — a stored flag is exactly what rots underwater in the incumbent designs. -/

liquidation threshold `r` (e.g. `r = 3/2` = 150% over-collateralization). -/
def Healthy (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) : Prop := p.debt * r ≤ p.value m

/-- **UNDERWATER** — the collateral value has fallen below the debt scaled by `r`. Exactly `¬ Healthy`
(`underwater_iff_not_healthy`). -/

  unfold Underwater Healthy; exact not_le.symm

/-! ## 2. Liquidation as a TOTAL transition — and liquidatability DEFINED through it. -/

/-- **`liquidate m r p`** — the liquidation transition. It is AVAILABLE (returns `some`) exactly when the
position is underwater at the mark, and REFUSED (`none`) on a healthy position (you never seize good
collateral). On liquidation the debt is cleared and the collateral seized (`⟨0, 0⟩` — the shortfall is
absorbed at the tip, never left to rot). -/
def liquidate (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) : Option Position :=
  if p.value m < p.debt * r then some ⟨0, 0⟩ else none

/-- **LIQUIDATABLE** — the position IS eligible for liquidation, DEFINED as the liquidation transition
being available. Crucially it is *not* a separate, laggable predicate: it is the operational transition
itself. `liquidatable_iff_underwater` proves it coincides with the mark condition, closing by
construction the gap the Certora bad state lives in. -/
def Liquidatable (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) : Prop := (liquidate m r p).isSome = true

/-- **`liquidatable_iff_underwater`** — liquidation eligibility ≡ being underwater. The eligibility
predicate cannot lag the mark, because it IS the mark condition (routed through the actual transition).
This is the seam every incumbent leaves open (a governance flag / keeper window / paused market that
trails the price) welded shut. -/
theorem liquidatable_iff_underwater (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) :

  unfold Liquidatable liquidate Underwater
  by_cases h : p.value m < p.debt * r <;> simp [h]

/-- **`liquidation_total_when_underwater` (KEYSTONE c):** whenever the ratio breaks (underwater),
liquidation is a TOTAL transition — it always returns `some`. A position cannot silently rot underwater:
the moment it crosses the threshold, liquidation is available. -/

/-- **`liquidate_none_when_healthy` (TOOTH):** a HEALTHY position cannot be liquidated — the transition
is refused. Liquidation is available exactly when needed and never otherwise; good collateral is not
seized. -/

/-! ## 3. KEYSTONE (a) — NO-BAD-DEBT: the Certora bad state is unconstructable. -/

/-- **`BadDebt m r p` — the Certora canonical bad state**: a position with debt that is underwater AND
NOT liquidatable. This is the "liquidatable-but-can't-repay" shortfall that becomes protocol bad debt in
Moonwell / Euler / xUSD. Below (`no_bad_debt`) it is proved UNINHABITED. -/
def BadDebt (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) : Prop :=
  0 < p.debt ∧ Underwater m r p ∧ ¬ Liquidatable m r p

/-- **`no_bad_debt` (THE KEYSTONE):** for EVERY mark, ratio, and position, the Certora bad state is
UNINHABITED — there is no underwater-and-unliquidatable position. Bad debt is unconstructable, not
monitored. The proof: `¬ Liquidatable` is (`liquidatable_iff_underwater`) exactly `¬ Underwater`, which
contradicts the `Underwater` conjunct. The state has no constructor. -/

  rintro ⟨_, hu, hnl⟩
  exact hnl ((liquidatable_iff_underwater m r p).2 hu)

/-- **`bad_debt_unconstructable` (TOOTH, the marquee):** restated as the refusal — the bad-debt state is
never inhabited, at any mark. This is the undercollateralization-impossible claim: given the mark, a
position that is underwater but cannot be liquidated simply does not exist in the state space. -/
theorem bad_debt_unconstructable : ∀ (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position), ¬ BadDebt m r p := no_bad_debt

/-! ### The structural face — the health classifier has NO bad-debt bucket. -/

/-- **`LoanHealth`** — the total health classification of a position. It has exactly THREE constructors;
there is **no `badDebt` / `underwaterSafe` constructor**. The "underwater but not liquidatable" bucket is
structurally absent from the type — unrepresentable, `DealLifecycle`-style. -/
inductive LoanHealth
  | clear        -- no debt
  | healthy      -- debt, adequately collateralized at the mark
  | liquidatable -- underwater — liquidation available (never "underwater and safe")
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- **`classify`** — a TOTAL classifier: every position at every mark lands in exactly one of the three
buckets. There is no branch that yields an underwater-yet-safe state, because that constructor does not
exist. -/
def classify (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position) : LoanHealth :=
  if p.debt ≤ 0 then .clear
  else if p.debt * r ≤ p.value m then .healthy
  else .liquidatable

/-- **`classify_exhaustive`** — the classifier's codomain is exactly `{clear, healthy, liquidatable}`;
there is no fourth (bad-debt) case. -/
theorem classify_exhaustive (h : LoanHealth) :
    h = .clear ∨ h = .healthy ∨ h = .liquidatable := by
  cases h <;> simp

/-- **`underwater_classified_liquidatable`** — a position with debt that is underwater is ALWAYS
classified `liquidatable`; it can never be silently filed elsewhere. The classifier routes the entire
underwater region to the one liquidation bucket. -/
theorem underwater_classified_liquidatable (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (p : Position)

/-! ## 4. Origination — an under-collateralized loan cannot be born. -/

/-- **`originate m r collateral debt`** — open a loan. It is admitted (returns `some`) ONLY when the loan
is adequately collateralized at the mark (`debt · r ≤ collateralValue`); an under-collateralized
origination is REFUSED (`none`). A freshly originated position is therefore never born underwater
(`originate_healthy`). -/
def originate (m : Mark) (r : ℚ) (collateral debt : ℚ) : Option Position :=
  if debt * r ≤ collateral * m.price then some ⟨collateral, debt⟩ else none

/-- **`originate_healthy`** — every originated position is HEALTHY: the system never enters the underwater
region through the front door. -/

  · rw [if_neg hc] at h; simp at h

/-- **`undercollateralized_origination_refused` (TOOTH):** a loan whose debt exceeds what the collateral
backs at the mark cannot be originated — it returns `none`. Under-collateralization is refused at the
tip, not cleaned up later. -/

    (h : collateral * m.price < debt * r) : originate m r collateral debt = none := by
  unfold originate; rw [if_neg (not_le.2 h)]

/-! ## 5. THE LENDING LIFECYCLE — partial transitions; illegal steps have no constructor. -/

/-- The lifecycle states, `Open → Healthy → Liquidatable → Liquidated` plus the happy `Repaid` terminal.
`Open` is the pre-origination edge (`originate`, §4, produces a `.healthy` loan); the state machine
proper spans `Healthy → Liquidatable → {Liquidated | Repaid}`. -/
inductive LoanState
  | healthy      -- originated + adequately collateralized at the mark
  | liquidatable -- the mark moved: underwater, liquidation available
  | liquidated   -- closed by liquidation (collateral seized, debt cleared, shortfall absorbed)
  | repaid       -- closed by repayment (happy terminal)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The two terminal states admit no further transition. -/
def LoanState.isTerminal : LoanState → Bool
  | .liquidated | .repaid => true
  | _ => false

/-- **A loan** — its lifecycle state, the position it carries, and the mark + required ratio it is read
against. (The mark travels with the loan so each transition guards on the CURRENT valuation.) -/
structure Loan where
  state : LoanState
  pos   : Position
  mark  : Mark
  ratio : ℚ

/-- **`Healthy → Liquidatable`** (partial): the mark moves to `m'` and the position is now underwater at
it. Returns `none` unless the loan is `.healthy` AND underwater at the new mark — you cannot mark a
solvent loan into liquidation. -/

  | _ => none

/-- **`Liquidatable → Liquidated`** (partial): a liquidatable loan is closed — collateral seized, debt
cleared. Returns `none` on any non-liquidatable state. -/
def liquidateLoan (l : Loan) : Option Loan :=
  match l.state with
  | .liquidatable => some { l with state := .liquidated, pos := ⟨0, 0⟩ }
  | _ => none

/-- **`Healthy → Repaid`** (partial): the borrower repays a healthy loan (debt cleared, collateral
returned). Returns `none` unless the loan is `.healthy`. -/
def repayLoan (l : Loan) : Option Loan :=
  match l.state with
  | .healthy => some { l with state := .repaid, pos := ⟨0, 0⟩ }

ALWAYS be liquidated — the transition is total there. Composed with `markDown_requires_underwater`, a
loan that goes underwater is moved to `liquidatable` and from `liquidatable` liquidation never blocks: a
loan cannot silently rot underwater. -/

/-! ## 6. KEYSTONE (b) — SOLVENCY: the lending pool covers all liabilities over ANY schedule. -/

/-- **`lending_pool_solvent_forever` (THE SOLVENCY KEYSTONE):** the lending reserve (a per-asset `Pool`
of collateral + loanable inventory) is SOLVENT at every reachable state, along ANY schedule of valid
fills — repayments, liquidations, draws — that respect the reserve floor. This is `pool_solvent_forever`
(`Market/Liquidity.lean`, the ∀-schedule portfolio invariant lifted from

/-- **`lending_backing_solvent_forever`** — the lending pool's disclosed backing line (a single
`MoneyInReserve` funded to `R`) is itself solvent forever, over EVERY attest/reverse/spend/finalize
schedule: `stripe_reserve_solvent_forever` reused verbatim (no new proof). The pool's inventory is
solvent (above) AND its funding is solvent (this) — never insolvent, never funded from thin air. -/

/-! ## 7. THE COMPOSED KEYSTONE — no bad debt AND solvent forever. -/

/-- **`lending_sound` — undercollateralization-impossible lending, in one theorem.** Given the mark, a
lending system with a solvent reserve and a valid fill schedule is simultaneously:

  * **(a) NO-BAD-DEBT** — the Certora bad state is unconstructable (`no_bad_debt`);
  * **(b) SOLVENT FOREVER** — the reserve is never negative at any reachable state
    (`pool_solvent_forever`), and its backing line is solvent (`stripe_reserve_solvent_forever`).

Not one line of the solvency backbone or the no-bad-debt derivation is re-proved elsewhere; this is their
