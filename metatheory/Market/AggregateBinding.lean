# Market.AggregateBinding — aggregate binding as a proof-carrying MSIS obligation

**codex fhEgg Round-3 Q1, the linked `(ct, C, Π)` carrier.** Each order carries a BDLOP-family
*additive* lattice commitment `C_i = Com(m_i; r_i)` whose BINDING is Module-SIS. The batch
AGGREGATES commitments by native ring addition: `C_agg = Σ C_i`. codex's sharp point, honored
exactly here: the SIS witness extracted from a binding break is

        A·(r − r') + G·(m − m') = 0

— it **includes the message difference `m − m'`** — so the Module-SIS instance must be sized to the
**accepted-aggregate opening radius**, not to a single order. A forgotten radius bound is a break.

## What this file is (honest scope)

This is the **reduction STRUCTURE**, not a security proof:

  * `Com` is the abstract *additive/linear* commitment shape `A·r + G·m` over a commutative ring
    `R`. The concrete BDLOP matrix distribution (`A, G` sampled, `‖·‖`-norms) is the crypto build,
    NOT this Lean. Linearity is the only load-bearing property, and it is exactly what turns a
    collision into a linear kernel witness.
  * `IsShort : R → R → Prop` is the abstract SIS norm bound on the *witness pair* `(dr, dm)` — it
    carries codex's radius, and it is a **REQUIRED field** of an `AggregateOpening`: an opening
    that forgot to establish its radius bound cannot be constructed (a forgotten radius = a type
    error).
  * `MSISHard A G IsShort` is a **NAMED hardness HYPOTHESIS** — "no short nonzero `(dr, dm)` lies in
    the kernel of `[A | G]`". It is **NEVER proven and NEVER laundered as an axiom** (`#assert_axioms`
    only inspects `axiom`-keyword decls; hardness enters solely as an explicit `Prop` hypothesis).

## Proven vs assumed

  * PROVEN (pure algebra): `collision_yields_msis_witness` — two distinct openings of one commitment
    yield the message-difference-carrying kernel witness, nonzero.
  * PROVEN (reduction): `aggregate_binding_of_msis` — GIVEN `MSISHard`, a radius-bounded collision of
    the aggregate commitment forces equality (binding). The security content is discharged onto the
    hypothesis; the theorem is the reduction, not the hardness.
  * ASSUMED: `MSISHard A G IsShort` (Module-SIS).  **Audit correction:** the historical
    `msisHard_trivial_model` below proves only logical consistency by defining the short set to contain
    `(0,0)` and nothing else.  It is not cryptographic non-vacuity: under that predicate the reduction's
    own `hshort` premise already forces the two openings equal.  The scalar `[A|G]` model is in fact
    refuted by the explicit radius-1 kernel witness `(1,-1)` at `A=G=1`
    (`AggregateBindingScalarFloorResidual`).  A faithful close must replace the scalar stand-in with
    the deployed matrix/ring distribution and an adversary-indexed Module-SIS advantage ensemble.

/-- The abstract additive/linear commitment shape: `Com A G r m = A·r + G·m`.

`A, G` are the (here scalar-modelled) BDLOP matrices, `r` the randomness, `m` the message. The
only property used downstream is LINEARITY in `(r, m)`, which is exactly what makes a collision a
linear kernel witness. The concrete matrix distribution is the crypto build, not this model. -/

/-- **The named Module-SIS hardness hypothesis** (assumption, never proven).

`MSISHard A G IsShort` asserts: there is NO short, nonzero pair `(dr, dm)` in the kernel of the
concatenated matrix `[A | G]`, i.e. with `A·dr + G·dm = 0`. `IsShort` carries codex's radius bound
on the *whole* witness pair — crucially INCLUDING the message component `dm`. This is carried as an
ordinary `Prop`; it is never an `axiom` and never discharged. -/

  ¬ ∃ dr dm : R, (dr ≠ 0 ∨ dm ≠ 0) ∧ IsShort dr dm ∧ A * dr + G * dm = 0

/-- **The crux (PROVEN, pure algebra).** Two DISTINCT openings `(r, m) ≠ (r', m')` of the SAME
commitment `Com A G r m = Com A G r' m'` yield the Module-SIS witness

        A·(r − r') + G·(m − m') = 0

with `(r − r', m − m')` nonzero. The witness **carries the message difference `m − m'`** — codex's
sharp point: the radius that sizes MSIS must bound this whole pair, not just `r − r'`. -/

/-- **Aggregate binding, the REDUCTION (PROVEN modulo the named hypothesis).**

GIVEN `MSISHard A G IsShort`, any two openings of the aggregate commitment whose difference is
short (radius-bounded, `IsShort (r − r') (m − m')`) and which open the SAME commitment must be
EQUAL. A binding break would be exactly the short nonzero kernel witness forbidden by `MSISHard`.

The security content lives entirely in the hypothesis `hard`; this theorem is the reduction. -/

radius. This is where a forgotten radius bound would be caught. -/

/-- **`collision_yields_msis_witness` FIRES on a concrete collision.** Over `ℤ` with `A = G = 1`,
`Com 1 1 2 3 = 5 = Com 1 1 1 4` while `(2,3) ≠ (1,4)`; the extracted witness `(2−1, 3−4) = (1, −1)`
is a nonzero kernel element `1·1 + 1·(−1) = 0`. The message component `3 − 4 = −1` is genuinely
present in the witness. -/

    (by simp only [Com]; norm_num)

/-- **Logical consistency witness only — NOT cryptographic non-vacuity.**  The model where the ONLY
short pair is `(0,0)` admits no short nonzero kernel element for any `A,G`.  Because a downstream
`hshort` in this model already states both opening differences are zero, this witness must not be used
as evidence that the deployed hardness floor is meaningful. -/

/-- **The reduction genuinely consumes `MSISHard`.** Instantiated at the trivial hardness model,
aggregate binding holds — and the ONLY way two openings can be short here is if their difference is
`(0,0)`, i.e. they were already equal; the reduction then returns equality. This exercises
`aggregate_binding_of_msis` against a live (non-`False`) hypothesis. -/
example (A G r m r' m' : R)
    (hshort : (r - r' = 0 ∧ m - m' = 0))
    (hcol : Com A G r m = Com A G r' m') :
    (r, m) = (r', m') :=

`(dr,dm)=(1,-1)` is nonzero, radius-one short, and lies in the kernel of `[A|G]` because
`1·1 + 1·(-1)=0`.  Thus the only positive floor witness in this file (`msisHard_trivial_model`) wins by
excluding this ordinary short vector.  Closing aggregate binding requires the actual BDLOP matrix/ring
instance and a resource-bounded adversary advantage statement, not this scalar existence-refutation. -/
