# Market.CrossChainSettlement — DrEX RUNG 8: CROSS-CHAIN SETTLEMENT (the ladder's capstone).

**A DrEX fill settles on ANY chain by proof.** This is the frontier of the DrEX rung ladder
(`docs/deos/DREX-DESIGN.md §4 rung 8, §3 #8`): a proven DrEX clearing produces a settled state root,
and any target chain's verifier — the LIVE EVM `DreggSettlement.sol`, the DEMONSTRATED CosmWasm
`cosmos-settlement/`, the DEMONSTRATED Solana `solana-settlement/` (alt_bn128) — checks that root and
advances its own `provenRoot` to include the DrEX fill. No bridge validators, no wrapped tokens, no
custody: dregg networks *proofs*, not tokens (`docs/deos/INTERCHAIN-MODEL.md`). The clearing itself is
a machine-checked, proof-carrying executor turn (rungs 1–7); this rung composes that with the
outbound settlement leg.

## The model (the clearing → root → settle chain)

A DrEX fill settles cross-chain when three things line up:

  (a) **the clearing is PROVEN** — a fair (`CycleValid`), conserving DrEX ring that SETTLES through
      the verified kernel executor (`settleRing pre (settlementsOf nodes) = some post`). This is
      rungs 1–7, KERNEL-REAL via `Market/LedgerRealizationExt.lean` (a cleared ring IS a
      `settleRing → recKExec` turn; its partial-fill lowering conserves on the real ledger,
      `partialFill_cycle_ledger_realized`). We bundle exactly this as `DrexClearing` — the
      proof-carrying fill the Groth16 settlement proof attests.

  (b) **the resulting state root is PROVEN to the target chain** — the settlement contract verifies a
      Groth16 proof of the dregg state transition `genesis_root → final_root` over `num_turns`
      (`DreggSettlement.sol::settle` step 4, the pairing check; the CosmWasm/Solana twins reproduce
      the SAME BN254 checks). The transition the proof attests is the DrEX clearing's `pre → post`:
      `final_root` IS `rootOf post`.

  (c) **the target chain ADVANCES its `provenRoot`** to include the DrEX fill — fail-closed on
      continuity (`genesisRoot == provenLanes`, the contract's `ContinuityBroken` check;
      `bridge/src/ethereum.rs::submit_eth_settlement`). We model this as `settleDrex`, the on-chain
      twin of `DreggSettlement.settle`'s accept-path.

## What is PROVED here (the composition) vs the honest scope

  * `drex_fill_cross_chain_settleable` (THE KEYSTONE) — a proven DrEX fill (`DrexClearing`: fair +
    conserving + kernel-real) whose pre-state root chains from the target chain's current proven root
    IS accepted by the settlement verifier: it advances the chain's `provenRoot` to the fill's
    post-state root (`rootOf post`) and its `provenHeight` by the batch's turn count — while the fill
    it settles is simultaneously the rung-1 conserving + fair clearing on the REAL executor ledger.
    So the clearing → root → settle chain is one theorem: a fair DrEX fill IS settle-able cross-chain.

  * FAIL-CLOSED, both teeth:
      - `settleDrex_continuity_broken` — a fill that does NOT chain from the current proven root is
        REFUSED (the `ContinuityBroken` gate — a fill cannot be replayed onto a foreign anchor);
      - `unfair_clearing_not_settleable` / `wrongAsset_clearing_not_settleable` — an over-debiting or
        wrong-asset "clearing" produces NO `DrexClearing` witness at all (it is not `CycleValid`,
        `Market.overdebit_refused` / `wrongAsset_refused`), so there is nothing to settle;
      - `no_minting_drex_clearing` / `minting_post_unsettleable` — a value-MINTING post-state is
        UNREACHABLE by `settleRing` (`settleRing_conserves`), so the verifier can NEVER advance its
        proven root to a value-minting root. A non-conserving/unfair clearing does not produce a
        settle-able root.

  * NON-VACUITY, both polarities: a concrete proven DrEX fill (`demoFill` — the `validSwapCycle`
    bilateral swap settling through a real kernel state with sufficient balances) settles cross-chain
    and genuinely ADVANCES the proven root (`demo_fill_settles_cross_chain`, `demo_root_advances`);
    and the same fill against a mismatched anchor is REFUSED (`demo_fill_refused_wrong_root`).

**HONEST GRADE — the clearing → root → settle chain is PROVED at SPEC level; the verifiers EXIST
(EVM LIVE, Cosmos/Solana demonstrated).** Two scope edges, named not hidden:

  * The **settlement verifier is modelled as its accept-path** (`settleDrex`: the continuity gate +
    the proven-root advance), the on-chain twin of `DreggSettlement.settle`. The Groth16 PAIRING
    check (`verifier.verifyProof`) — that a proof `π` attests the transition `pre → post` — is the
    circuit obligation `DrexClearing.settled`/`.valid` STAND IN for: here the transition is a genuine
    conserving executor turn by construction. The pairing itself is the crypto floor the deployed
    verifier already checks (Groth16 over BN254; `chain/gnark/`), on a single-party **dev ceremony**
    setup (toxic-waste-known), not mainnet MPC — the rung-8 caveat `DREX-DESIGN.md §6` names once.

  * The **DrEX → settlement PROOF-GENERATION wiring** — turning a real DrEX fill into a FRESH Groth16
    settlement proof whose `final_root` is `rootOf post` — is the NAMED build. At HEAD it is blocked
    on the fixture-geometry bug a sibling is fixing; the VERIFIERS that check such a proof already
    EXIST and one (`DreggSettlement.sol`) is LIVE on Base-Sepolia (`chain/DEPLOYMENTS.md`). This
    module proves the SPEC the proof-gen must realize: that a fair DrEX clearing's settled root IS a
    valid input to the settlement verifier's accept-path.

Cross-chain ATOMICITY of a *single multilateral cycle whose legs settle on different chains* (a
commit/abort protocol across verifiers) is a further open rung (`DREX-DESIGN.md §6`, RESEARCH); this
module settles a whole DrEX fill's root onto ONE target chain — the outbound leg, the buildable-now
capstone.

Pure. No new axioms — every bridge composes existing kernel + clearing keystones.

/-- **`settleDrex rootOf S c`** — the target chain's settlement verifier applied to a DrEX fill `c`
(the on-chain twin of `DreggSettlement.sol::settle`, and its CosmWasm/Solana peers). It advances the
proven-root register to the fill's post-state root iff the fill CHAINS from the current proven root:

  * **continuity** (`rootOf c.pre = S.provenRoot`) — the settlement's `genesis_root` must equal the
    current `provenRoot` (the contract's `ContinuityBroken` gate, `DreggSettlement.sol:210-215`;
    `bridge/src/ethereum.rs`'s `advance.old_root != state.proven_root` rejection). FAIL-CLOSED: a fill
    that does not chain from the current anchor is REFUSED (`none`) — it cannot be replayed onto a
    foreign root.

On accept, `provenRoot` advances to `rootOf c.post` (the proof's `final_root`) and `provenHeight`
grows by the batch's turn count (`_provenHeight += numTurns`). The Groth16 pairing check
(`verifier.verifyProof`, step 4) is what proves `c.pre → c.post` is a genuine transition; here that is
`c.settled`/`c.valid` by construction. `numTurns > 0` is automatic (`DrexClearing.numTurns_pos`). -/

PROVEN DrEX fill `c` (`DrexClearing`: fair `CycleValid`, conserving, KERNEL-REAL via `settleRing`)
whose pre-state root chains from the target chain's current proven root (`hcont`) is ACCEPTED by the
settlement verifier:

  * **(SETTLE)** `settleDrex` advances the chain's proven-root register: its new `provenRoot` is the
    DrEX fill's post-state root `rootOf c.post` (the settlement proof's `final_root`), and its
    `provenHeight` grows by the batch's turn count. The fill settles on the target chain.
  * **(CONSERVING, kernel-real)** the settled transition preserves every asset's supply on the REAL
    executor ledger (`settleRing_conserves` — the fill mints/burns nothing);
  * **(FAIR)** the settlement is structurally `RingBalanced` (no phantom value) AND every leg respects
    its declared limits — debited only its offered asset ≤ its offer, credited its wanted asset ≥ its
    minimum (`clearing_respects_limits`);
  * **(PRICED, kernel-real)** the priced partial-fill lowering conserves over ℚ
    (`pricedPartialFills_conserves`) — the settled root is the SAME trades as the rung-5 priced
    clearing, the model↔kernel correspondence `Market/LedgerRealizationExt.lean` welds.

The clearing → root → settle chain, as one theorem: a fair DrEX clearing's settled root IS a valid

fill queryable via `isProvenRoot(finalRoot)` on the target chain (`DreggSettlement.sol:227`,
