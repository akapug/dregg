# Market.Liquidity — DrEX rung 6: the PROVEN-SOLVENT liquidity pool (the backstop).

**DrEX — the Dragon's Egg Exchange** — is a Lean-first proof-carrying exchange (the `metatheory/Market/`
tower). Rungs 1/2/4/5 clear a book **multilaterally**: the ring/CoW matcher finds Coincidences of Wants
and settles them fair + conserving through the proved kernel (`Market/Clearing.lean`,
`Market/Fairness.lean`, `Market/Aggregation.lean`, `Market/Optimality.lean`), over the ℚ-priced,
partial-fillable substrate of `Market/Priced.lean` (`Fill`, `execPrice`, `legDelta`, `netFlow`,
`Conserves`). But a ring can only clear what has a counterparty. A LONE order — a one-sided residual
with no matching want in the book — is `¬ Conserves` on its own (`residual_clears_against_pool`).

This rung is the **liquidity backstop** (DREX-DESIGN.md §5 / §6, DREGGFI-VISION "provably-never-insolvent
pool"): a standing pool holding per-asset reserves against which that residual clears. The pool is the
counterparty of last resort. Its guarantee — the thing no AMM ships — is a **solvency theorem**:

  * **`pool_solvent_forever` (THE KEYSTONE):** the pool's per-asset reserve is NEVER negative at any
    reachable state, along EVERY schedule of fills, provided each fill respects the reserve floor
    (`PoolFillValid` — the pool can only pay out what it holds). This is the ∀-adversary object of
    `Dregg2/Verify/StripeReserve.lean`'s `stripe_reserve_solvent_forever` (`0 ≤ escrow` forever over
    every `SSched`) **lifted from a single reserve channel to a portfolio** of per-asset reserves. The
    single-channel theorem is REUSED (not re-proved) as the pool's disclosed BACKING line
    (`pool_backing_solvent_forever`); the portfolio version is proved here as the fold-invariant of a
    validity discipline that is the exact analogue of Trustline's `ReserveWF`.

  * **CONSERVATION.** Every pool fill is zero-sum with the order it clears: the pool absorbs exactly the
    negative of the order's per-asset flow (`pool_fill_conserves`, `poolDelta = − legDelta`). Composed
    with `Priced.netFlow`, a residual that alone does not conserve (`¬ Conserves [f]`) plus the pool's
    absorption conserves (`pool_absorbs_netFlow`) — the pool never mints or burns.

Honest scope: this proves the **reserve-priced pool that is provably never negative** — the core
never-insolvent claim, both polarities (a concrete schedule of draws stays solvent + the reserves are
`#guard`ed; an overdraw is `¬ PoolFillValid` and provably drives a reserve below zero; a minting
"counter-leg" fails conservation). The next sub-rung is the **constant-function AMM curve** `x·y = k` as
a `MarketClearing`-preserving family — pricing the fill off the curve and proving `x·y` non-decreasing —
layered ON TOP of this solvency floor (named, not yet built). A never-insolvent pool with a stated price
is the load-bearing guarantee; the curve is the pricing policy above it.

`StripeReserve.MoneyInReserve`'s single channel — one reserve line per asset.) -/
abbrev Pool := AssetId → ℚ

/-- **The pool is SOLVENT** when no per-asset reserve is negative — it never owes more of any asset than
it holds. The portfolio analogue of `0 ≤ escrow` (`stripe_reserve_solvent_forever`). -/
def Pool.solvent (p : Pool) : Prop := ∀ a, 0 ≤ p a

/-- **`poolDelta f a`** — the pool's per-asset change when it is the counterparty of fill `f`: it GAINS
what the order offers (`+filledIn` of `offerAsset`) and PAYS what the order wants (`−filledOut` of
`wantAsset`). Exactly the negative of the trader's `legDelta` (`poolDelta_eq_neg_legDelta`) — the pool
is the mirror side of the trade. -/

/-- **A fill is VALID against the pool** when it respects the order's terms (`FillValid`, reused from
rung 5) AND the pool holds enough of the wanted asset to pay it (`filledOut ≤ reserve` — the floor). The
second clause is the solvency discipline: the pool can only disburse what it has. This is the pool's
`ReserveWF` — the analogue of Trustline's "a provisional spend commits only to the extent the reserve
backs it". -/

/-- **`pool_absorbs_netFlow`** — composed with `Priced.netFlow`: a single residual order's net asset
flow, plus the pool's absorption, is 0. The ring+pool combined clearing CONSERVES even when the ring
alone does not (`residual_clears_against_pool`). -/

/-- **`poolStep_solvent` (the invariant step):** clearing a `PoolFillValid` fill against a SOLVENT pool
leaves it SOLVENT. The pool gains the offered asset (reserve grows) and pays the wanted asset only up to
what it holds (the floor). This is the single-step core the ∀-schedule keystone folds. -/

(no new proof) — the single-channel guarantee under the portfolio. The pool's inventory is solvent
