# Market.ShieldedClearing — DrEX RUNG 3: PRIVATE MATCHING (the marquee).

**The multilateral ring matcher clears over SHIELDED notes** — matching over hidden commitments,
with no operator peek and no decryption committee. This is the one thing no system in the DrEX
scholar survey (`docs/deos/DREX-DESIGN.md §1`) can copy: Penumbra decrypts a per-block aggregate with
a `t`-of-`n` validator committee; CoW's solvers see every order; Shutter's Keypers hold the key. DrEX
decrypts **nothing** — because there is nothing to decrypt.

This module WELDS three already-proven towers into one private-matching statement, re-proving none of
them:

  1. **The ring clearing over the matched cycle** (`Dregg2/Intent/Ring.lean` + `Market/Fairness.lean`):
     `settleRing_conserves` (per-asset supply preserved across the whole ring, on the REAL executor
     ledger), `cycleValid_settlement_balanced` (structurally closed — no phantom value), and
     `clearing_respects_limits` (every leg debited only its offered asset ≤ its offer, credited its
     wanted asset ≥ its minimum — the give+receive fairness). CRUCIALLY these are stated over
     `MatchNode` — the OFFERED/WANTED columns the matcher reads — which in the shielded setting are
     the pool's HIDDEN commitments (`circuit-prove/src/shielded/pool.rs`: value + owner + asset all
     behind `commit_hidden_asset`). The matcher clears the COMMITTED claims, never the clear ledger.

  2. **The per-leg shielded spend refinement** (`Dregg2/Shielded/ClaimRefinement.lean`):
     `shielded_spend_claim_refines` — a valid shielded-spend claim `[nullifier, merkle_root,
     value_binding]` (the note is a MEMBER of the tree at `merkleRoot`, and its `nullifier` is FRESH)
     REFINES a sound VM step: it is AUTHORIZED (spends a real committed member note whose full
     preimage the spender knows — the C6 value-theft tooth) and preserves NO-DOUBLE-SPEND (fresh →
     joins the spent set → never re-spendable). WHO traded stays hidden (owner/key inside
     `HidingFriPcs`); only the nullifier is revealed, and only to gate the double-spend.

  3. **The homomorphic per-asset conservation over hidden values** (`Dregg2/Exec/ShieldedValue.lean`):
     `created_value_conservation` — `Σ commit(vᵢ, rᵢ) = commit(Σ vᵢ, Σ rᵢ)` (the Pedersen `commit_hom`
     collapse). So `Σ C_in − Σ C_out = 0` IS per-asset conservation, CHECKABLE OVER THE COMMITMENTS
     ALONE — a verifier confirms the ring created no value without learning any single amount. This is
     the shielded pool's Schnorr-excess conservation (`pool.rs:33-41`) composed with the ring's
     balance: conservation while every value stays hidden.

## What is PROVED here (composed) vs the honest scope

  * `shielded_ring_clears` (THE KEYSTONE) — a shielded ring whose matched cycle is `CycleValid` and
    whose ledger settlement commits is simultaneously: **(a) CONSERVING** per asset on the real
    executor ledger; **(b) FAIR** — structurally `RingBalanced` AND every leg within its committed
    offer/want limits; **(c) PRIVATE + NO-DOUBLE-SPEND** — every leg spends a real member note (hidden
    owner/value) whose nullifier is fresh and, once spent, can NEVER be re-spent.
  * `shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden` (THE HIDDEN-CONSERVATION WELD) — if the ring's spent (input)
    and created (output) notes carry equal value+blinding sums (the balanced cycle), their COMMITMENT
    sums are equal — the homomorphic excess is zero, provable on commitments with no value revealed.
  * `shielded_ring_clears_real_crypto` (THE REAL-CRYPTO WELD, §4b) — the SAME two hidden-crypto halves
    over the REAL primitives that retire the two toy stand-ins the audit flagged: hidden conservation
    over the real two-generator group Pedersen (binding = DLog `CryptoPrimitives.binding`) and
    membership over the real Poseidon2 tree (root-binds-set = `Poseidon2SpongeCR`), so a forged
    committed set forces a collision. See `Dregg2.Shielded.RealCrypto`. The generic
    `shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden`'s in-file `refVC`/`refTreeRoot` witnesses are the toy
    stand-ins; the real primitives + their named floors (DLog / Poseidon2 CR) live in that module.
  * NON-VACUITY, both polarities: a concrete two-leg shielded ring (`demoShieldedRing`, two DISTINCT
    fresh member spends over a `CycleValid` swap) clears fair + private; and the TEETH — a re-used
    nullifier is refused (`shielded_leg_no_double_spend`, from `unshield_no_rewitness`), an
    over-debiting/wrong-asset matching never FORMS (`Market.overdebit_refused` / `wrongAsset_refused`,
    reused), and a value-minting output makes the commitment excess NON-zero (`#guard`).

**HONEST GRADE — Lean SPEC + note-level circuit, endpoint descriptor BUILT.** This lands the
*specification* of DrEX rung 3: the private-matching clearing is a machine-checked theorem composing
the shielded-spend leaf + the ring + the nullifier freshness.  The deployed Rust AIR now also realizes
the two-leg and N-leg note-algebra layer.  The matching and endpoint layers below are both built;
they converge on ONE remaining residual — the serialized-trace descriptor refinement:

  * The **matching layer (`MatchNode`) and the shielded-spend claim are fused in the deployed ring
    AIR**, which constrains `offerAsset`/`offerAmount` to the spent note's `asset`/`value`; the Lean
    theorem `LedgerRealizationExt.shielded_ring_fused_clears` states the corresponding `LegFused`
    composition.  What remains is not this note-algebra weld but a Lean-authored descriptor refinement
    from the serialized AIR trace to that semantic object.
  * The **endpoint circuit realization** is now BUILT in `Market.ShieldedRingEndpointDescriptor`.
    The two-leg and N-leg Rust AIRs fold real shielded-spend leaves and enforce
    fusion/cycle/conservation; the Lean-authored endpoint-carrying host `shieldedRingEndpointDescriptor`
    (name `"shielded-ring-clear-2-endpoint-wide"`) mirrors that deployed AIR and now publishes and
    constrains the faithful eight-lane kernel pre/post endpoints (`ringCommit8_pre_binds_kernel` /
    `ringCommit8_post_binds_kernel`), the endpoint action pins, and the receipt-log transition
    (`receiptRoot_endpointPostLog`, `RingEndpointAccepted.receipt_transition`); its acceptance object
    forces the ring clearing and the kernel endpoints (`RingEndpointAccepted.clearing_nodes` /
    `.kernel_endpoints`).  What is still residual is the full
    `Market.ProtocolAssurance.ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` — the refinement binding a `Satisfied2`
    proof over the SERIALIZED AIR trace to that semantic apex step (the same serialized-trace residual
    the matching-layer edge above names).

## THE PAYOFF — this deletes the `intent/src/trustless.rs` DECRYPT committee.

DrEX's front-running prevention today rests on a `t`-of-`n` threshold-decryption committee
(`trustless.rs`: `threshold_decrypt`, Shamir shares) — the residual trust `docs/deos/DREX-DESIGN.md §6`
is candid about. Matching over hidden commitments removes it entirely: the matcher reads the COMMITTED
claims (`clearing_respects_limits` over `MatchNode`), settles by spending NULLIFIERS (`unshieldK`,
never revealing owner/value), and conservation is checked over the Pedersen commitments
(`shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden`). **No party ever holds the plaintext or the ordering power** —
"private and fair without an operator who can peek."

/-- **A shielded ring leg** (parametrised by the pool registry `poolOf : AssetId → CellId`): the
matcher's committed claim (`node : MatchNode`, the OFFERED/WANTED columns — HIDDEN commitments in the
shielded pool) bound to the SHIELDED spend that backs it (a committed `unshieldK` of the claim's
nullifier over the leg's own pre-state). The bundled proofs `hbound`/`hstep` are exactly the
hypotheses `Dregg2.Shielded.shielded_spend_claim_refines` consumes, so a leg's spend is guaranteed to
refine a sound VM step (AUTHORIZED + NO-DOUBLE-SPEND) — the private authorization the matcher never
sees the plaintext of.

The two layers are composed, not yet fused (see the module header): `node` is what the matcher clears
(committed offer/want), `claim`/`hstep` is the private note-spend that settles it. -/

`Dregg2.Shielded.shielded_spend_claim_refines`: the leg (a) spent a REAL committed member note whose
value moved to `dst` (AUTHORIZED — membership is the shielded authorization, the owner stays hidden),
and (b) its nullifier was FRESH, joins the spent set, and can NEVER be re-spent (NO-DOUBLE-SPEND). The

/-! ## 3. THE KEYSTONE — the shielded ring clears CONSERVING + FAIR + PRIVATE. -/

/-- **`shielded_ring_clears` — DrEX RUNG 3, the private-matching clearing.** A shielded ring whose
matched cycle is `CycleValid` (the graph the solver actually searches — over the HIDDEN committed
claims), with positive wants, that settles through the VERIFIED executor
(`settleRing k (settlementsOf (matchNodes sr)) = some k'`), is simultaneously:

  * **(a) CONSERVING** — for every asset the total supply is preserved on the REAL executor ledger
    (`settleRing_conserves` — the ring mints/burns nothing);
  * **(b) FAIR** — the settlement is structurally `RingBalanced` (closed, no phantom value) AND every
    leg respects its committed limits: debited only its offered asset in amount ≤ its offer, credited
    its wanted asset in amount ≥ its declared minimum (`clearing_respects_limits`);
  * **(c) PRIVATE + NO-DOUBLE-SPEND** — every leg spends a REAL committed member note (owner/value
    hidden), whose nullifier was fresh, joins the spent set, and can NEVER be re-spent
    (`ShieldedLeg.refines`).

The whole matching+clearing runs over the COMMITTED claims and settles by spending nullifiers — no
party ever holds a leg's plaintext. This is the marquee: private and fair with no operator who can
peek, no decryption committee. Atomicity rides the same fold separately (`settleRing_atomic`: a
failing leg leaves no `some k'`). -/

/-! ## 4. THE HIDDEN-CONSERVATION WELD — the excess is zero over the COMMITMENTS ALONE. -/

/-- **`shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden` — conservation over HIDDEN notes.** If the ring's spent
INPUT notes and created OUTPUT notes carry equal value sums AND equal blinding sums (exactly what a
balanced conserving cycle enforces — value in = value out), then their Pedersen COMMITMENT sums are
equal: `Σ commit(vᵢ_in, rᵢ_in) = Σ commit(vⱼ_out, rⱼ_out)`. So the homomorphic excess `Σ C_in − Σ
C_out = 0`, and a verifier confirms the ring created no value **checking only the commitments** —
never learning a single amount. This composes the shielded pool's per-asset Schnorr-excess
conservation (`pool.rs:33-41`) with the ring's balance: the shielded pool's `created_value_conservation`
(`Σ commit = commit Σ`) applied to both sides, glued by the balance hypotheses. Matching over hidden
commitments conserves. -/

    listCommitment vc ins = listCommitment vc outs := by
  rw [created_value_conservation vc ins hin, created_value_conservation vc outs hout, hval, hbl]

/-! ## 4b. THE SAME WELD OVER REAL CRYPTO — retiring the two toy stand-ins.

`shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden` above is generic over any `ValueCommitment`, but its
witnesses (`demo_hidden_conservation`) ran on the TOY `refVC` (`commit v r = (v+r).toNat` —
additive, non-binding), and `ClaimRefinement`'s membership ran on the TOY `refTreeRoot` (a linear
rolling hash, no CR). `Dregg2.Shielded.RealCrypto` re-grounds BOTH on the real primitives the tree
already carries, with the honest floors named:

  * hidden conservation over the REAL two-generator group Pedersen (`commit v r = v·G + r·H`,
    `commit_hom` PROVED) — binding rests on the DLog carrier `CryptoPrimitives.binding`;
  * membership over the REAL Poseidon2 tree (`root = sponge leaves`) — root-binds-the-leaf-set
    rests on the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (the SAME sponge CR `StateCommit`/`SortedTreeNonMembership`
    bind under), so a forged committed set forces a Poseidon2 collision.

The two toys were structurally weak, not merely small: `ValueCommitment.hom` demands
`Nat`-additivity, satisfiable ONLY by a linear stand-in — a real Pedersen is not `Nat`-additive, it
lives in a group, so the real conservation lives at the GROUP layer (`RealCrypto.ring_conserves_pedersen`).
-/

/-- **`shielded_ring_clears_real_crypto` — rung-3's two hidden-crypto halves over REAL primitives.**
A balanced ring over the real group Pedersen conserves on the COMMITMENTS (hidden conservation,
under DLog `binding`), and a leaf committed under the real Poseidon2 tree has its membership root
bind the leaf set (under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`), so a forged set forces a collision. This is
`shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden` + the membership half, re-stated over the retired-toy
replacements — a direct re-export of `RealCrypto.rung3_real_crypto`. -/

Two DISTINCT fresh member spends (asset 0 / asset 1, nullifiers 99 / 88) bound to the `CycleValid`
bilateral swap `validSwapCycle` (`Dregg2/Intent/Ring.lean`). The matched cycle is genuine (each offers
what the other wants, enough, creators distinct); each leg is a real committed shielded spend. So the
FAIR + PRIVATE clauses of `shielded_ring_clears` are inhabited by a real multi-leg shielded ring — NOT
vacuously true. -/

blinding 3 carry equal value AND blinding sums, so their commitment sums are EQUAL (the homomorphic
excess is zero) — conservation confirmed on the commitments alone. -/

#guard legAPost.kernel.nullifiers == [99]
-- Leg B spends the asset-1 note (nf 88, value 4): dst 2 credited 0 → 4, pool 3 → 0, nullifier spent.
