# EmitWideUMemWeldRegistryProbe — the Lean-emitted WIDE+UMEM WELDED registry TSV (STAGED slice).

Prints ONE TSV line per WELDED wide member, in the EXACT order + key set of
`CapOpenEmit.v3RegistryCapOpenWide` (so the welded registry is a member-for-member, name-stable
COVER of the wide registry's emit-source members):

  `<live key>\t<welded member.name>\t<emitVmJson2 (welded member)>`

Each welded member is the purely-ADDITIVE `weldUMemIntoWide host (wideKeyUMemDomain key)` of the
corresponding wide member — the single-domain cohort `umemOp` over 7 fresh columns + the
`umemory` / `umem_boundary` tables appended PAST the wide carriers, `piCount` UNCHANGED (the 16
wide-commit PIs / the 8-felt anchors ride through, NO narrowing).

## The gentian refuse rides REFUSE-FIRST (welded onto the host, THEN the umem leg)

The gentian deployed-default flip welds the capacity-floor refuse onto the 36 bare cohort routes.
On the WELDED twin the refuse is applied to the wide HOST **before** the umem leg — i.e.
`weldUMemIntoWide (gentianWideBareRefuse host) dom` — so the refuse aux blocks ride PAST the wide
carriers (at `host.traceWidth`) and the umem leg rides PAST the refuse (at `host.traceWidth + 48`).
This is the EXACT composition the runtime producer takes: `prove_wide_umem_welded_staged` welds umem
onto the ALREADY-refuse-welded wide member it reads from `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV`
(`weld_umem_into_wide_descriptor(wide+refuse)`), and the Rust weld-parity tooth
(`wide_umem_weld_registry_parity_and_no_narrowing`) asserts each welded member equals exactly that.
Welding refuse AFTER umem (the earlier order) placed the refuse aux past the umem columns, so the
runtime producer's descriptor (refuse-first) and this verifier twin (refuse-last) diverged — an
honest umem-welded turn proved against one layout and verified against the other
(`OodEvaluationMismatch`). Refuse-first makes them coincide.

This is the byte source of the ADDITIVE Rust artifact
`circuit/descriptors/rotation-wide-umem-welded-registry-staged.tsv` (pinned by
`WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_FP`). NOTHING on the live wire changes — the deployed bare wide registry /
FP / VK are UNTOUCHED, `umem_witness_enabled` stays false.

SCRATCH executable: `lake env lean --run EmitWideUMemWeldRegistryProbe.lean`.
