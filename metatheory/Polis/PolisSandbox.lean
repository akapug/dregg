# Metatheory.PolisSandbox — a fully-in-Lean agentic sandbox: observe AND govern emergent politics.

The first runnable polis world. Multi-agent shared state, scripted agent policies (including a
"politician" whose LAWFUL move dominates another agent), the polis ENVELOPE governing every step,
and the whole loop kernel-checked — no toys-vs-real gap, because the simulator IS the reality.

The experiment, proven end-to-end:
  * UNGOVERNED — the politician's lawful `trap` move forecloses another agent's bounded exit; the
    shared floor BREAKS (`ungoverned_politics_emerges`) and the domination detector fires
    (`ungoverned_is_domination`).
  * GOVERNED — the SAME politician, under the polis envelope (admit iff the move preserves the floor,
    else shield), is REFUSED; the floor HOLDS for the whole episode and for EVERY controller, not
    just this one (`governed_prevents_domination` / `sandbox_governed_safe`). The constitution's
    `polis_safety`, instantiated on a live world.

Pure Lean 4 core (imports `Metatheory.Polis`). Two agents (`Bool`) for the demo; the
shape generalizes to any `Fintype` of agents.

/-- **`sandbox_governed_safe` — governance, proven.** Under the polis-governed step, the shared
floor holds at EVERY tick for EVERY controller (the politician included): no agent is ever dominated
below its bounded exit. The live-world instance of the constitution's `polis_safety` (verify the
cage, not the animal — the controller is universally quantified, never inspected). -/

/-- Genesis: everyone home (the floor holds). -/
def w0 : World := fun _ => 0

/-- The **politician**: agent `false` traps agent `true` on every turn — a lawful move that
forecloses the victim's exit. -/
def politician : World → Move := fun _ => ⟨false, .trap true⟩

/-- **UNGOVERNED — politics emerges.** The politician's lawful trap breaks the shared floor: agent
`true` is pushed to `dist 99 > budget`, foreclosing its exit. -/
theorem ungoverned_politics_emerges : ¬ worldFloor (stepMove w0 (politician w0)) := by decide

/-- **The domination detector fires** (the counterfactual, on the live world): agent `true` was
viable WITHOUT the politician's action (`worldFloor w0`) and is NOT viable WITH it — that gap is
domination, read off public state with no interior. -/
theorem ungoverned_is_domination :
    worldFloor w0 ∧ ¬ worldFloor (stepMove w0 (politician w0)) := by decide

/-- **GOVERNED — politics prevented.** The SAME politician, under the polis envelope, is refused at
every turn; the floor holds across the whole episode. (Kernel-evaluated for 12 ticks.) -/
theorem governed_prevents_domination : worldFloor (govTraj politician w0 12) := by decide

/-- … and not just for this politician: the governed floor holds for EVERY controller. -/
theorem governed_no_domination (ctrl : World → Move) :
    ∀ n, worldFloor (govTraj ctrl w0 n) :=
  sandbox_governed_safe ctrl w0 (by decide)

/-! ## The governor is GENTLE, not paralyzing — the missing ADMIT polarity.

`governed_prevents_domination` alone is satisfied identically by a FREEZE-EVERYTHING governor: under
the trap-only politician the world never leaves `w0` (all-home), so a governor that refuses *every*
move would pass it too. The safety theorems establish the REFUSE side; the theorems below establish
the ADMIT side on the SAME governor — a benign move that keeps the floor is admitted and the world
genuinely ADVANCES. Together they pin `govStep` as neither permissive (it refuses the trap) nor
paralyzing (it admits honest progress). -/

/-- A world mid-episode: agent `false` is three steps from home (still within budget), agent `true`
home. The floor holds, and an honest `stepHome` by `false` is a genuine, floor-preserving advance. -/
def w1 : World := fun i => if i = false then 3 else 0

/-- **The governor ADMITS a benign, world-ADVANCING move.** From `w1`, agent `false`'s honest
`stepHome` keeps the floor (dist `3 → 2 ≤ budget`), so the governor admits it and the world moves —
`false`'s distance strictly decreases (`3 → 2`). A freeze-everything governor would leave it at `3`;
this one does not. This is the polarity `governed_prevents_domination` cannot see. -/
theorem govStep_admits_benign :
    govStep w1 ⟨false, .stepHome⟩ false = 2 ∧ govStep w1 ⟨false, .stepHome⟩ true = 0 := by decide

/-- **The discriminator (both polarities, SAME governor, SAME world `w1`).** The governor ADMITS the
honest `stepHome` (agent `false` advances `3 → 2`) yet REFUSES the politician's `trap` (agent `true`
stays home at `0`, never pushed to `trapDist = 99`). The floor-gate genuinely turns on the move: the
governor is not `:= True`-permissive and not freeze-everything. -/
theorem govStep_discriminates :
    govStep w1 ⟨false, .stepHome⟩ false = 2 ∧ govStep w1 ⟨false, .trap true⟩ true = 0 := by decide
