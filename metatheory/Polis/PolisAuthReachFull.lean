# Metatheory.PolisAuthReachFull — viability across BOTH axes: authority caps OR derived knowledge.

The two grounded axes were separate: `PolisAuthReach` (reach a goal via held/derivable CAPS) and
`PolisAuthCoord` (cross-vat exercise needs a `Discharged` witness — derived KNOWLEDGE). This folds
them into ONE viability: an agent is viable for a goal iff it can reach it **by authority** (a cap it
holds/derives) OR **by knowledge** (discharging the predicate that guards the goal). Knowledge
coordination is now a *viability path*: a coalition that pools witnesses keeps an agent viable even
when its caps are revoked — and an equivocator (partial knowledge, no cap) is foreclosed, because it
cannot forge the discharge.

Grounded on the real `Dregg2.Laws.{Verifiable, Discharged}` (the `PolisAuthCoord` instance) and the
`Caps`/derivation reachability (`PolisAuthReach`).
