# Metatheory.PolisAuthExecGraph — viability over the DEPLOYED authority executor's own graph.

`PolisAuthLive`/`PolisAuthAtlas` compute the delegation rule-base from a `Caps` and then EDIT that
`Caps` by hand to model a delegate/revoke. `PolisAuthExec` governs the deployed `Kernel.exec` — but
that executor only moves balance; it holds `caps` FIXED, so it can neither delegate nor revoke. This
file closes the op-set gap: viability is connectivity in the executor's OWN reconstructed authority
graph (`Dregg2.Spec.execGraph`, the graph `authorizedB` reads), and the cap-state changes are the
DEPLOYED authority turns `Dregg2.Exec.recKDelegate` / `recKRevokeTarget` — not a Lean-side edit.

The weld rides the executor's already-proven graph-change equalities:
  * `recKDelegate_execGraph` — a committed Granovetter delegation IS `Spec.addEdge` on `execGraph`;
  * `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` — a target revocation IS `Spec.removeEdge` on `execGraph`;
  * `recKDelegate_grounds` — the delegation gate witnesses the source edge (`Spec.Endow.holds_source`).

So:
  * `delegate_unlocks_reach` / `exec_delegate_unlocks` — running the deployed delegate turn makes the
    recipient REACH the target in the executor's own graph (the added edge), no hand-edit.
  * `revoke_forecloses_reach` / `exec_revoke_forecloses` — running the deployed revoke turn FORECLOSES
    the holder (the removed edge), straight from `removeEdge`.
  * `reachGovGraph_refuses_revoke` — the polis governor SHIELDS the executor's foreclosing revoke
    (`genGovStep` over the reach floor), and `reachGovGraph_admits_delegate` passes the unlock.

The reachability is read from the SAME `execGraph` the deployed `authorizedB`/`exec` authorize
against, and every cap change is a real `recKDelegate`/`recKRevokeTarget` turn of the deployed
authority executor. No `sorry`, no load-bearing `True`; non-vacuity is `decide`-checked on a concrete
2-cell graph.

/-- **`ReachesGraph caps b t`** — cell `b` can reach `t` iff it holds an edge to `t` in the
executor's OWN reconstructed authority graph `execGraph` (the graph `authorizedB` reads). This is
`Spec.Graph.has` of `execGraph` — viability over the deployed authority structure, not a hand-rolled

/-- **`delegate_unlocks_reach`.** When `delegator` holds an edge to `t` (the Granovetter gate),
copying its held `t`-cap to `recipient` — exactly what the deployed `recKDelegate` does on commit —
makes `recipient` reach `t` in the executor's graph. Rides `recKDelegate_execGraph` (the cap-edit IS
`addEdge`). -/

/-- **`exec_delegate_unlocks`.** The same fact phrased over the deployed executor: a COMMITTED
`recKDelegate` turn leaves `recipient` reaching `t` in the post-state's authority graph. The gate is
discharged by the executor's own `recKDelegate_grounds` (the source edge held). -/

/-- **`revoke_forecloses_reach`.** Filtering out every `t`-conferring cap from `holder` — exactly the
deployed `recKRevokeTarget` cap-edit — leaves `holder` UNABLE to reach `t` in the executor's graph.
Rides `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` (the cap-edit IS `removeEdge`), which kills the `holder ⟶ t`
edge outright. -/

turn (which always commits), the holder no longer reaches the revoked target in the post-state's
authority graph. -/

Viability over the deployed authority executor, in one breath:

  1. `ReachesGraph caps b t := (execGraph caps).has b t` — connectivity in the executor's OWN
     reconstructed authority graph (the one `authorizedB` reads).
  2. `exec_delegate_unlocks` / `exec_revoke_forecloses` — running the DEPLOYED `recKDelegate` /
     `recKRevokeTarget` turn unlocks / forecloses reach, via the executor's proven `addEdge` /
     `removeEdge` graph-change equalities — no hand-edited `Caps`.
  3. `reachGovGraph_refuses_revoke` / `_admits_delegate` — the polis governor shields the foreclosing
     executor revoke and passes the viability-preserving executor delegate.
