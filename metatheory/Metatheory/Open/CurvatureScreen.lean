# Metatheory.Open.CurvatureScreen — CLOSING the OrbitalScreen OPEN: the curvature-aware screen.

`Dregg2.Apps.OrbitalScreen` builds a continuous-time-sound collision screen. It is EXACT for
an AFFINE relative trajectory `d(t) = d0 + t·v` (`screen_clear_imp_continuous_clear`), and it
ships a Lipschitz fallback `coarseClear`/`coarse_clear_imp_lipschitz_clear` that is sound for
ANY speed-bounded trajectory — crucially, that fallback takes the speed bound `vmax` as an
explicit HYPOTHESIS rather than smuggling affinity back in. The module then flags one OPEN
(its closing comment, ~lines 394–404):

  > "Upgrading to a curvature-aware bound (a second derivative / `n²`-term envelope) is the
  >  next refinement … the true CW relative solution adds bounded oscillatory/secular terms
  >  `O(n²·t²)` … A curvature-aware screen would bound `sepSq(t)` below by the affine value
  >  minus a `½·κ·t²` envelope (κ a second-derivative bound), recovering an exact continuous
  >  guarantee WITHOUT assuming affinity."

This module CLOSES that OPEN. The honest shape is exactly the `coarseClear` shape: the screen
is sound for an ARBITRARY relative-separation function `sepFn : ℚ → ℚ` (NOT assumed affine),
PROVIDED it meets a STATED curvature-envelope hypothesis with `κ` an explicit parameter — just
as `coarse_clear_imp_lipschitz_clear` is sound for any `sepFn` meeting a stated `vmax` bound.

================================================================================
## THE PHYSICS — why the envelope is `affine − ½·κ·t²`, faithfully (the Taylor/CW story).
================================================================================

Write the true (curved) relative separation along an axis or the genuine 3-D separation as a
C² function `s(t)` of time into the step. Taylor with the Lagrange remainder at `t = 0`:

    s(t) = s(0) + s'(0)·t + ½·s''(ξ)·t²     for some ξ ∈ (0, t).

If the SECOND derivative is bounded by a curvature constant `κ` over the step,
`|s''(ξ)| ≤ κ`, then the remainder is bounded BELOW by `−½·κ·t²` (it can be as negative as
`−½·κ·t²`), so the curved separation is bounded below by its OWN first-order (affine) part
minus the worst-case curvature drop:

    s(t) ≥ s(0) + s'(0)·t − ½·κ·t²  =:  g(t).          (the curvature ENVELOPE)

This is faithful to the Clohessy–Wiltshire / Hill relative dynamics. There the relative
acceleration is `r̈ = A·r + B·ṙ` with the CW matrix carrying the mean motion `n`; the entries
are `O(n²)` and `O(n)`, so the second derivative of any component — and hence of a smooth
separation — is bounded over a step by a `κ = O(n² · scale)` constant. The exact CW solution's
non-affine part is precisely the bounded oscillatory/secular `O(n²t²)` curvature the envelope
absorbs. The honest move (mirroring `coarseClear`'s `vmax`): we take that `κ` bound as the
hypothesis `hcurv` below and DERIVE soundness from it; we do not assume the trajectory affine.

Because the envelope `g(t) = sep0 + slope·t − ½·κ·t²` is a CONCAVE (downward, since `κ ≥ 0`)
parabola, its minimum over the step `[0,T]` is attained at an ENDPOINT — `min(g(0), g(T))`.
That is decidable and `#eval`-able, so the curvature screen checks `min(g(0), g(T)) ≥ thr`.

**STRICT GENERALIZATION of the affine screen.** With `κ = 0` the envelope is exactly the
affine lower line and the screen reduces to the affine endpoint check (`affine_is_curv_zero`).
With `κ > 0` it is genuinely STRONGER: the teeth (`§4`) exhibit a curved separation that clears
at both endpoints AND at the affine interior vertex, yet is correctly REJECTED because the
curvature drop `½·κ·t²` breaches the threshold mid-step — a breach the affine screen, and an
endpoint sampler, both miss.

**THE RESIDUAL (stated precisely, never faked).** This module is sound for any `sepFn` meeting
the explicit curvature-envelope hypothesis `hcurv`. It does NOT itself DERIVE the constant `κ`
from the CW mean motion `n` (that quantitative `κ = O(n²·scale)` derivation, the `s''` bound on
the genuine CW solution, would need a ℝ-analysis development of the CW matrix exponential and
is OUT OF SCOPE — exactly as `coarseClear` does not derive `vmax` from the dynamics either).
What is CLOSED: the curvature screen is genuinely sound for a CURVED (non-affine) trajectory
under a stated `κ` envelope, and strictly generalizes the affine screen. That is the OPEN's
"curvature-aware screen … recovering an exact continuous guarantee without assuming affinity."

/-! ## 1. The curvature envelope `g(t) = sep0 + slope·t − ½·κ·t²`.

`sep0` is the linear separation at `t = 0`, `slope` its first-order rate, and `κ ≥ 0` the
second-derivative bound. The Taylor/CW remainder argument (header) gives the envelope: a curved
separation `sepFn` with `|s''| ≤ κ` satisfies `sepFn t ≥ g t` over the step. We work with the
NON-squared linear separation (as `coarseClear` does), so the envelope is a genuine lower bound
on distance and the geometry stays honest. -/

/-- The **curvature envelope** at time `t`: the affine lower line minus the worst-case
second-order curvature drop, `g(t) = sep0 + slope·t − ½·κ·t²`. With `κ = 0` this is the affine
lower bound; with `κ > 0` it is a downward (concave) parabola. -/

/-- **The envelope is CONCAVE over `[0,T]`: its minimum is at an ENDPOINT (PROVED).**
For `κ ≥ 0` and any `t ∈ [0,T]`, `g(t) ≥ min(g(0), g(T))`. This is the curvature analogue of
`OrbitalScreen.sepSq_min_at_tca`: where the affine (upward) parabola took its min at an
interior vertex, the concave envelope takes its min at the boundary, so the two endpoint values
bound the envelope over the WHOLE step. The proof: a concave function lies above the chord
joining its endpoints, and the chord lies above its own minimum endpoint. -/

/-! ## 2. THE CURVATURE SCREEN — `clear` iff both endpoint envelope values clear the threshold.

By `envelope_ge_min_endpoints`, the minimum of the concave envelope over `[0,T]` is the smaller
of its two endpoint values. So the screen needs only check those two — decidable, total,
`#eval`-able, exactly the spirit of `OrbitalScreen.screen`. -/

/-- The **curvature-aware screen** over the step `[0,T]`: clear iff the curvature envelope
clears the threshold `thr` at BOTH endpoints (equivalently, at its concave minimum). `sep0` is
the linear separation at `t=0`, `slope` its first-order rate, `κ ≥ 0` the second-derivative
bound. Decidable and runnable. -/

(the Taylor/CW second-order lower bound `sepFn t ≥ sep0 + slope·t − ½·κ·t²`, with `κ ≥ 0` the
second-derivative bound — see header), if `curvScreen … = true` then `thr ≤ sepFn t` for EVERY
`t ∈ [0,T]`. Sound for a CURVED (non-affine) trajectory; `κ` is the honest hypothesis. -/

/-! ## 3. STRICT GENERALIZATION — at `κ = 0` the curvature screen IS the affine endpoint check.

The curvature screen with `κ = 0` collapses to the affine endpoint check `min(sep0, sep0 +
slope·T) ≥ thr`. So it is a conservative *extension* of the affine line check: anything the
affine check passes, the `κ = 0` curvature screen passes, and vice versa. Turning on `κ > 0`
only TIGHTENS it — never loosens — which is exactly what "strictly generalizes" means here. -/

/-- **`affine_is_curv_zero` — the curvature screen specializes to the affine line check
(PROVED).** With `κ = 0` the envelope is the affine lower line `sep0 + slope·t`, so `curvScreen`
reduces to "both affine endpoints clear `thr`". Hence the affine screen is the `κ = 0` case and
the curvature screen strictly generalizes it (any `κ > 0` only adds the concavity drop). -/

  rw [e0, eT]

/-! ## 4. TEETH — a CURVED pair that clears at the endpoints AND the affine vertex,
but the CURVATURE term correctly breaches.

This is the whole point and the strict-generalization "teeth". We build a concrete curved
separation `sepFn` whose:
  * affine part `sep0 + slope·t` clears `thr` everywhere on `[0,T]` (so the AFFINE screen, and
    an endpoint sampler, BOTH say "clear" — UNSOUND for the curved truth);
  * curvature envelope `sep0 + slope·t − ½·κ·t²` DROPS below `thr` mid-step;
  * actual value `sepFn` realizes that drop, with a genuine mid-step conjunction.
Then `curvScreen` correctly returns `false`, and `sepFn` meets the envelope hypothesis. So the
curvature screen is genuinely STRONGER than the affine screen on a curved case.

Concretely: `sep0 = 10`, `slope = 0` (the affine part is the CONSTANT line `10`, well clear of
`thr = 6` everywhere), `κ = 2`, `T = 4`. Affine endpoints/vertex all read `10 ≥ 6` ⇒ affine
"clear". But the envelope at `t = 4` is `10 − ½·2·16 = 10 − 16 = −6 < 6`. The realized curved
separation is exactly the envelope, `sepFn t = 10 − t²`, which at `t = 3` is `1 < 6` — a true
conjunction the affine screen misses. -/
