# Metatheory.Open.PerfectUC — CLOSING an honest FRAGMENT of the §6 UC OPEN.

`Metatheory.EpistemicConsensus §6` proves a *static* composition fragment
(`honest_dist_knowledge_composes`: pooling honestly-verified facts) and then states, as a
sharp `-- OPEN:`, the FULL Canetti UC composition theorem, which is **dynamic** and
quantifies over environments/simulators:

    (∀ Z, view_Z(π) ≈ view_Z(F))  →  (∀ Z, view_Z(ρ^π) ≈ view_Z(ρ^F)).

The repo is right that the FULL theorem needs (i) an interactive-machine / probabilistic
execution model (`view_Z` is a probability ensemble), (ii) a simulator `S` witnessing the
*computational* indistinguishability `≈` of ensembles, and (iii) a hybrid argument over the
context `ρ`. None of those belong in this order/realizability frame, and we do NOT pretend
to prove them.

## WHAT THIS MODULE CLOSES (the PERFECT / statistical fragment, deterministic ideals)

In the **perfect** (information-theoretic, no-PPT) setting for **deterministic** ideal
functionalities, computational indistinguishability `≈` *collapses to equality of the
environment's view* — a function, not a probability ensemble. We make that precise:

  * An **environment** `Z`, a **protocol** `π`, an **ideal** `F` are modelled by their
    *external behaviour*: the map `Z → View` an environment-indexed family produces. A
    `System` is exactly that behaviour `beh : Z → View` (this IS the UC "view of `Z`" as a
    *function* — the perfect-case collapse of the ensemble).
  * **Perfect realization** `π ⊑ F := ∀ z, π.beh z = F.beh z` — the environment's view is
    *identical* for EVERY environment. This is `≈` with the indistinguishability advantage
    forced to `0` for all `Z` (statistical/perfect security).
  * A **context** `ρ : Context` **interposes**: it is a transformer of behaviours
    that may rewrite the environment it presents to the inner system (`pre`), wrap that
    system's reply (`post`), and even inject side-channel observations — but it touches the
    inner system **only through its `beh` view interface** (the UC discipline: `ρ` uses `π`
    as a black box). `ρ^S` is the resulting composed system.
  * **Perfect-UC composition** (`perfectUC_composition`): `π ⊑ F → ρ^π ⊑ ρ^F`. In the
    perfect case the hybrid/substitution argument IS function composition: identical inner
    views are carried through any context that consumes the inner system through its view
    (`congrArg`/extensionality on the interface). The proof is short *because the model is
    perfect*, not because it is degenerate — `ρ` provably reshapes the view (teeth below).

## TEETH (non-vacuity — `⊑` is a real, two-sided constraint)

  * `tighten`/`leak` are concrete *non-trivial* contexts (they rewrite the environment and
    post-process / leak a side bit — `context_genuinely_interposes` proves `ρ^S ≠ S` and even
    `ρ^S₁ = ρ^S₂` for distinct `S₁ ≠ S₂`, so `ρ` really collapses/reshapes information).
  * `realizes_witness` : a concrete `π ⊑ F` that HOLDS, and `perfectUC_carries_through` shows
    composition transports it through the non-trivial `leak` context.
  * `realizes_fails` : a concrete pair with `¬ (π ⊑ F)` (views differ at some `z`), so `⊑`
    is NOT vacuously true — it rejects.

## BRIDGE TO THE STATIC FRAGMENT

`honest_static_is_degenerate_context` connects this to
`EpistemicConsensus.honest_dist_knowledge_composes`: the static "pool two verified facts"
result is the perfect-UC theorem at the **identity (degenerate) context** — composition with
the trivial context preserves a conjunction of discharged views.

## RESIDUAL (still OPEN, explicitly a PARAMETER — NOT proved here)

The COMPUTATIONAL UC theorem — PPT environments, probabilistic execution ensembles, a
simulator witnessing *negligible* advantage `≈` (not `=`) — remains exactly the cryptographic
residue flagged in `EpistemicConsensus §6`, `ConstructiveKnowledge §2`, `EpistemicDial §6`.
This module replaces `≈` by `=` (the perfect collapse) and `View`-ensembles by `View`-values;
it does NOT model probability, PPT, or computational indistinguishability, and makes NO claim
to. That is a probabilistic-process-calculus module of its own.

/-! # §1. Systems = external behaviours; perfect realization `⊑`.

A UC `System` is identified with the *view* an environment family obtains from it: a map
`Z → View`. In the PERFECT setting the environment's view is a plain value (not a probability
ensemble), so `System Z View := Z → View`. The empirical content of "`Z` interacts with the
system and outputs its view" is the application `S.beh z`.

`perfectly_realizes π F` (notation `π ⊑ F`) is `∀ z, π.beh z = F.beh z`: every environment's
view of `π` is *identical* to its view of `F`. This is computational indistinguishability `≈`
with the distinguishing advantage pinned to `0` for ALL environments — the perfect /
statistical case. -/

/-! # §2. Contexts that interpose, but only through the view interface.

A UC **context** `ρ` is the calling protocol/environment that USES the inner system as a
subroutine — a "wrapper". The UC discipline is that `ρ` may talk to the inner system *only
through its view interface* (`beh`), treating it as a black box. We model this faithfully:

  * `pre : Z' → Z` — `ρ` decides *which inner environment* to present (it may rewrite, fix,
    or multiplex the environment it received).
  * `post : Z' → View → View'` — `ρ` post-processes the inner system's reply, possibly mixing
    in its own side-channel observations (a function of the outer environment `z'`).

`ρ^S` (`ρ.compose S`) is the system whose behaviour on `z'` is `post z' (S.beh (pre z'))` —
the context interposes, but reaches the inner system ONLY via `S.beh`. Because the access is
*through the interface only*, the context is a function of `S.beh`, which is exactly why
perfect realization survives it.

This is faithful, not degenerate: `pre` can be non-injective (collapsing distinct outer
environments onto one inner query — information loss), `post` can discard or fabricate parts
of the view (a genuine wrapper), and `§3`'s teeth prove such a `ρ` provably changes the
system (`ρ^S ≠ S`). The composition theorem is therefore a real substitution, not a `rfl` on
a system left untouched. -/

/-- A **context** transforming `System Z View` into `System Z' View'`: it rewrites the inner
environment (`pre`) and post-processes the inner view together with its own side channel

system's `beh` view interface (the UC black-box discipline). -/

The headline of this module. If `π` perfectly realizes `F`, then for ANY context `ρ`, the
composed system `ρ^π` perfectly realizes `ρ^F`. In the perfect case the UC hybrid/substitution
argument is exactly *function composition*: the context reaches the inner system only through
its view, identical inner views (`π ⊑ F`) produce identical post-processed views, for every

composition. (The COMPUTATIONAL theorem — PPT `Z`, probabilistic ensembles, negligible
advantage — is the explicit residual; see the module header. Here `≈` is `=`.) -/

We rule out two flavours of vacuity:

  * **Degenerate context.** A theorem about contexts is empty if every context leaves the
    system untouched (`ρ^S = S`, making composition a `rfl`). We exhibit concrete contexts
    `tighten`/`leak` that *provably change* the system: `leak^S ≠ S` in general, and `leak`
    is even non-injective on systems (it collapses two distinct systems onto one composed
    behaviour) — genuine interposition / information reshaping.
  * **Vacuous `⊑`.** `⊑` is empty if it never holds, or trivial if it always holds. We give
    a concrete pair with `π ⊑ F` (and carry it through `leak`), and a concrete pair with
    `¬ (π ⊑ F)` (views differ at some environment) — so `⊑` is a genuine two-sided
    constraint. -/

`EpistemicConsensus.honest_dist_knowledge_composes` is the *static* fragment: pooling two

Model the verified-view as a system over the trivial environment `Unit` whose view at every
environment is the pair "(is `X` discharged, is `Y` discharged)" — a perfect (deterministic)
view. The *identity context* `idContext` is the degenerate `ρ` (`pre = id`, `post` = drop side

verified view — the static "verified ∧ verified stays verified" read as perfect composition

The §4 teeth use `Nat`/`Bool` toys; §5's `verifiedSys` already rides the real `Frame.verified`.
This section grounds perfect-UC in the **selective-disclosure ideal functionality** of real
dregg2: an environment supplies a full cell state, and the system's view is the schema-public
projection `Dregg2.Privacy.project` — the genuine tier-1 privacy primitive. We show two
*different protocol realizations* of this ideal that compute the same public view (one reads the
state directly, one re-assembles it through the disclosure mask) **perfectly realize** each
other (`⊑`), and that the realization SURVIVES an interposing context — perfect-UC

Closed (FRAGMENT): **perfect (statistical) UC composition for deterministic ideal
functionalities** — `perfectUC_composition : π ⊑ F → (ρ^π) ⊑ (ρ^F)`, where `⊑` is equality of
the environment's view (the perfect collapse of `≈`) and `ρ` is a black-box context that
interposes (`§4`: `tighten^idSys ≠ idSys`, `leak` collapses distinct systems). The
relation `⊑` is witnessed both HOLDING (`realizes_witness`, carried through `leak`/`tighten`)
and FAILING (`realizes_fails`; the composition hypothesis is load-bearing,
`composition_needs_hypothesis`). The static §6 fragment of `EpistemicConsensus` is recovered as
the identity-context instance (`§5`).

Still OPEN (explicit parameter, NOT proved): the **computational** UC theorem — PPT
environments, probabilistic execution ensembles, a simulator witnessing *negligible* advantage
(`≈`, not `=`). That is a probabilistic-process-calculus model of its own and is NOT modelled
here; we make no claim to it. -/
