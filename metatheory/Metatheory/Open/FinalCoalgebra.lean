# Metatheory.Open.FinalCoalgebra — CLOSING the §3 OPEN: the final coalgebra exists.

`Metatheory.Categorical` §3 (`Coalgebra`) states the behaviour endofunctor
`F X = Obs × (Adm → X)` (a Moore/DFA shape), the category of `F`-coalgebras
(`Cell`/`CoalgHom`), and the terminal-coalgebra universal property (`IsFinalCell`).
It proves the *uniqueness* half of finality (`ana_unique`, `final_unique_roundtrip`)
**conditionally** on a final cell existing, but leaves OPEN the *existence*:

    ∃ νF : Cell Obs Adm, IsFinalCell νF

This module CLOSES that OPEN, constructively, by exhibiting the
classical **Moore-behaviour** final coalgebra: the carrier is `List Adm → Obs` (a state
is "what would I observe after each finite input word"), the structure map reads the
empty-word observation and shifts each successor by prepending its input letter, and the
anamorphism of any cell `c` sends a state `x` to the function `w ↦ c.obs (run x w)` where
`run` replays the word `w` through `c`'s transitions. Commutation and the *unique*-anamorphism
condition are both proved (uniqueness by induction on the input word), discharging
`IsFinalCell` for ARBITRARY `Obs Adm : Type u`.

No new axioms: `#assert_axioms nuF_exists` (and the keystone lemmas) pins the result to the
kernel's own primitives. We do NOT weaken `IsFinalCell`; this closes the repo's actual
`Metatheory.IsFinalCell` for the repo's actual `Metatheory.Cell`.

## §4 — CONSUMING `νF` from the REAL cell (`Dregg2.Boundary.TurnCoalg`).

The §1–§3 result proves `νF` *exists* but, by itself, leaves it orphaned: nothing in
`Dregg2/` mentions `nuF`. §4 closes that gap. The real cell system is a
`Dregg2.Boundary.TurnCoalg` (carrier `Carrier`, structure map `step : Carrier → F …`),
whose behaviour functor `Boundary.F Obs Adm X = Obs × (Adm → X)` is *definitionally* the
`Metatheory.Fobj` this module's `Cell`/`νF` are built over. We:

  * reinterpret a real `TurnCoalg` as a `Metatheory.Cell` (`cellOfTurnCoalg`, a definitional
    repackage — no data is invented);
  * exhibit its **anamorphism into `νF`** (`Boundary.anaInto`, the unfold the real cell did
    not have before): every real cell state `x` maps to the Moore behaviour `w ↦ obs (run x
    w)`;
  * state **no-drift as agreement-with-νF** (`Boundary.no_drift_into_nuF`): ANY two coalgebra
    morphisms from the real cell into `νF` have equal carrier maps — the real cell's behaviour
    is *canonically determined* by the final coalgebra, so two observers that both unfold it
    into `νF` cannot disagree. This is the coinduction principle (`IsFinalCell.uniq`) applied
    to the concrete `Dregg2` cell, the load-bearing consumption the audit's fix (4) names.

So `νF` is not orphaned: the concrete turn system unfolds INTO it and
inherits its uniqueness.

The behaviour functor of the real cell, `Dregg2.Boundary.F Obs Adm X = Obs × (Adm → X)`, is
**definitionally** the `Metatheory.Fobj Obs Adm X` this module's `Cell`/`νF` ride. So a real
`TurnCoalg` repackages to a `Cell` with no invented data, its anamorphism into `νF` is the
unfold the concrete cell previously lacked, and the final coalgebra's uniqueness becomes a
no-drift statement ABOUT the real turn system. -/

Every state `x` of the real `TurnCoalg` `T` unfolds to the Moore behaviour
`w ↦ T.obs (run x w)`: "what this cell observes after replaying the admissible-turn word `w`".
This is a genuine coalgebra morphism `cellOfTurnCoalg T ⟶ νF` (the §1 `anaHom` at the
repackaged cell). Before §4, no map from a `Dregg2` cell into `νF` existed; this exhibits it. -/

/-- **`Boundary.no_drift_into_nuF` — no-drift as agreement-with-`νF`, PROVED, kernel-clean.**
ANY two coalgebra morphisms from the real cell `T` into the final coalgebra `νF` have *equal*
carrier maps. The real turn system's behaviour is therefore **canonically determined** by
`νF`: two observers that each unfold the concrete cell into the final coalgebra cannot drift
apart — they compute the same Moore behaviour. This is `IsFinalCell.uniq` (the coinduction
principle) applied to the concrete `Dregg2.Boundary.TurnCoalg`, the load-bearing consumption
of the §1–§3 existence result. -/

/-- **Every real-cell unfold into `νF` IS the canonical anamorphism.**
The sharper form: any coalgebra morphism `g` from the real cell into `νF` equals the
anamorphism `anaMap`, hence `g.f x w = T.obs (run x w)`. So the final coalgebra does not just
*forbid* drift, it *pins* the real cell's behaviour to one explicit Moore unfold. -/
