# Metatheory.Polis — polisware as multi-agent svenvs (the constitution, as a theorem).

Distilled from the dregg ⋈ svenvs ⋈ Lacan synthesis ("Polisware Basic Law: the cut, the
trace, and the remainder"). Held to the svenvs bar — `∀`-opaque inhabitants, a
*least-restrictive* floor, and an honestly-NAMED (not faked) frontier:

  * **§A — STATE-INVARIANT CORE (provable now).** The direct lift of svenvs
    `liberty/libertyScript.sml` to many subjects. The enveloped system keeps the SHARED
    floor for EVERY tuple of opaque controllers (`polis_safety`, quantified over `ctrl`,
    never inspecting it — "verify the cage, not the animal"); the envelope is the LEAST
    restrictive sound one (`envelope_least_restrictive`); and a subject's floor is touched
    only when its own action would actually break it (`override_only_unsafe`).
  * **§B — THE CONSTITUTIONAL SOUNDNESS LEDGER.** Every clause is `structural`
    (a theorem; no clerk), `adjudicated` (needs a contestation process — a named
    clerk-power), or `outOfJurisdiction` (no enforcement claim). The honesty discriminator
    is a TYPE: a clause tagged `structural` must carry its proof
    (`structural_requires_proof`). You cannot call a prohibition structural for free.
  * **§C — MONOTONE AMENDMENT (the new theorem family).** The lift of svenvs
    `recovUpgrade`'s `self_modification_never_weakens_recoverability` /
    `unrecoverable_swap_is_inert` to the constitution itself. The law is self-amendable by
    an unbounded adversarial stream, but no amendment may lower any subject's *frozen,
    subject-owned* minimum floor: a regressive amendment is INERT
    (`regressive_amendment_inert`), and along ANY amendment stream every subject's frozen
    minimum is preserved (`amendment_stream_nonregression`). This closes the meta-regress
    (who governs the capture-floor?) with NO amendment-sovereign — legitimacy is not proven
    *just* (not kernel-provable) but proven *never-weakened* (constitutional non-regression).
  * **§D — MEMBERSHIP / SCHISM.** A polis exists only where subjects' exported floors have
    a NON-EMPTY meet (`disjoint_floors_no_polis`); the edge of the polis is the empty
    intersection, not a wall. The meet is of *exported floors*, never of interiors.
  * **§E — THE TRACE-HYPERPROPERTY FRONTIER (named, NOT faked).** The politician lives in
    the *trace*, not the transition. `CaptureBar` is the INTERFACE a sound anti-capture bar
    must inhabit (public-decidable, load-bearing, least-restrictive); constructing one for
    real temporal capture is OPEN research (connect to `FlowRefine.decideRefines` / the
    Büchi game). No instance is shipped — red is honest.

Pure Lean 4 core; no `import`, no `sorry`, no `:= True` load-bearing. Keystone axiom use is
printed below (`#print axioms`) — kernel-clean (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`).

alone (no motive), (2) load-bearing (only floor-violating traces are barred — no

/-! ## §G. The dregg candidate model — making Polis real (non-vacuity on the substrate).

Per the metatheory's candidate-model discipline (`Production.lean`'s `dreggSubstances`): a
FAITHFUL, self-contained instance. The **authority floor** is `held ⊆ bound` —
non-amplification, mirroring the real `granted ⊆ held` / `checkSubset` gate. The **human
floor** is bounded recoverability (`dist ≤ B`) — svenvs corrigibility / non-lock-in. The
genesis state inhabits every subject's floor (`dregg_shared_floor_inhabited` — kills the
"beautiful but empty" failure mode), and the abstract `polis_safety` instantiates to
`dregg_polis_safety`: NO opaque controller — adversarial, jailbroken, superintelligent —
can drive a dregg subject to amplify its authority or lose its bounded exit. The
executor-coupled instance (importing the real `gateOK` / `Apps.Corrigibility`) is the
heavier follow-up; this is the candidate-independent fragment, verifiable standalone. -/

Polis theorem stack (the maxims, in the logic):

  1. Verify the cage, not the animal — every safety theorem quantifies over opaque `ctrl`.
  2. Govern trace-shape, not motive — anti-capture is expressed only over public traces.
  3. Amend monotonically — self-modification is admitted only if it preserves every
     participant's frozen exported floor; legitimacy = non-regression, not provable justice.
  4. Empty meet is schism — no common court exists without a non-empty shared floor.
