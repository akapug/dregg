# Metatheory.DreggPolis — the END-TO-END weld: the abstract Polis constitution
# (`Metatheory.Polis`) instantiated on the REAL dregg substrate.

`Polis.lean` proved the constitution as candidate-independent theorems and exhibited a
self-contained candidate model. This file welds the spine to the ACTUAL dregg tree —
gpt5.5's "make Polis real":

  * **§1 — Layer-2 disclosure law, bound to a REAL theorem.** The constitution's
    Minimal-Boundary right (A4/R2: "the gate consumes only the discharged predicate; turning
    the disclosure dial down proves the same") is a `structural` clause whose proof IS the
    real `Metatheory.EpistemicDial.DiscloseAt.accepts_invariant_under_dial`
    ("proves the same while reveals less"). `structural_requires_proof` extracts it. Refusal-
    is-not-confession is classified `adjudicated` (a clerk-power, NOT a kernel theorem) and
    private-inference `outOfJurisdiction` — and the honesty discriminator is shown to BITE
    (their status is provably not `structural`).
  * **§2 — the authority floor on the REAL rights type.** The spine runs over
    `Dregg2.Authority.Auth` — the eight l4v IPC authorities (`read … control … notify`): no
    opaque controller can drive a dregg subject to hold an authority outside its bound
    (`dreggReal_polis_safety`) or lose its bounded recovery. The toy `DRight` of `Polis §G` is
    replaced by the deployed authority enum.
  * **§3 — the CI hard-gate.** `#assert_axioms` (from `Dregg2.Tactics`) FAILS the build if any
    welded keystone leaves the clean set — gpt5.5's "verified, not claimed", enforced.

The human floor here is the candidate-independent recovery shadow (`dist ≤ B`, svenvs
corrigibility / non-lock-in); its deployed form is the KERI identity floor
`Dregg2.Apps.PreRotation.rotChain_pinned_by_commitments` ("compromise of the current key
cannot rewrite the past" — you cannot lose your identity); the live register-carrier recovery game
over `rotateWrite` (incl. the multi-link bridge `writeStep_commits_target`) is built in
`Metatheory.PolisRecoveryWrite`. The executor-coupled authority floor refines this list-subset
shadow only as a TIGHTENING, not a gap: `held ⊆ bound` IS the deployed `fits` relation by
`Dregg2.Authority.USet.fits_iff`, and the camera `Fpu` form is pinned in `PolisNonConfusion`.

/-! ## §4. The politician at trace level — a CONCRETE CaptureBar over REAL dregg states.

Concrete trace semantics now exist (`List RState` over the deployed `Auth`), so per gpt5.5's
precondition the first real anti-capture bar can land: exit-foreclosure (the politician's
signature lawful move — driving another subject below its bounded recovery), decidable from
the public trace with NO interior inspection. The DEEP frontier (multi-trace hyperproperties:
clerk-monopoly, hole-rent, grade-laundering; the Büchi/flow connection) stays named. -/

/-- **`rExitForeclosureBar` — a CONCRETE CaptureBar on real dregg-state traces.** Bars exactly
the foreclosing traces (zero false positives), decidable from the public trace alone (no
motive), least-restrictive. Refutes "CaptureBar is a vacuous interface" — here is one real
anti-domination bar over the deployed substrate. -/

  publicDecidable := fun τ => inferInstanceAs (Decidable (rForeclosesB B τ = true))
  loadBearing := fun _ h => h
  leastRestrictive := fun _ h => h

/-- **`dreggReal_envelope_no_foreclosure`** — the politician defeated by construction: the
envelope pins `dist ≤ B`, so for EVERY opaque adversary and every step, no dregg subject's
bounded exit is ever foreclosed. (The single-trajectory case; the multi-agent interleaved
hyperproperty is the frontier.) -/
theorem dreggReal_envelope_no_foreclosure (B : Nat) (ctrl : RState → RState) (n : Nat) :
    (traj rStep (envAct (rPol B) rShield ctrl) ⟨[], 0⟩ n).dist ≤ B :=
  (dreggReal_polis_safety B ctrl n true).2

/-- TEETH: a clean trace clears the bar; a trace driven to `dist 9 > budget 5` trips it. -/
