# Metatheory.Dynamics.Initiality — the D2/R9 probe: is the Argus IR INITIAL?

## The claim under test (R9, DREGG3 §2.4)

> The Argus IR (`Dregg2.Circuit.Argus.RecStmt`) is the INITIAL algebra over the dregg3
> doctrine, so `interp` (= the executor) and `compile` (= the circuit) are the UNIQUE
> homomorphisms out of it — every pair of readings AGREES BY UNIQUENESS, not by per-effect
> differential. If true, the N²-agreement-proof burden collapses to ONE initiality theorem.

The register names the risk precisely: the IR has `guard`s and an EFFECTFUL interpretation,
so a plain initial-algebra-in-`Type` may not fit — it likely needs a Freyd / graded-monad /
Kleisli shape. This file finds out and delivers the precise verdict.

## What `interp`'s real signature forces (the categorical home)

The cornerstone (`Argus/Stmt.lean:104`) is

    interp : RecStmt → RecordKernelState → Option RecordKernelState

i.e. each `RecStmt` term denotes an arrow `RecordKernelState ⇸ RecordKernelState` in the
**Kleisli category of the `Option` monad** — a PARTIAL state transformer, the partiality being
exactly the `guard`/`insFresh`/`checkLe`/`checkSubset` rejection (`none`). And `interp` is
defined by STRUCTURAL RECURSION on `RecStmt`, with the recursive constructor

    interp (.seq s t) k = (interp s k).bind (interp t)            -- KLEISLI composition.

So the honest categorical home is:

  **`RecStmt` = the INITIAL algebra (in `Type`) of the polynomial signature functor `Σ`
  whose operations are the constructors; the "two readings" are folds landing in the HOM-SET
  of the Kleisli category `Kl(Option)` of partial state transformers `State ⇸ State`.**

This is the Freyd/Kleisli answer the register predicted: `interp` is NOT a map into `Type`,
it is a map into `State → Option State` (a Kleisli arrow), and `seq` is interpreted by Kleisli
composition `>=>`. The signature is a FREE algebra over that effectful target — `interp` is the
unique `Σ`-algebra homomorphism (= the fold / catamorphism) induced by choosing, for each
constructor, its Kleisli operation. THAT uniqueness is what R9 wants.

## The VERDICT: **PARTIAL.**

  * (PASS half) **Initiality holds for the term algebra, and `interp` IS the unique
    fold.** We reify the choice of "one Kleisli operation per constructor" as a `StmtAlgebra`
    (`§1`), define the induced fold `foldStmt` (`§2`), prove `interp` IS that fold for the
    canonical `interpAlgebra` (`interp_eq_fold`, `§3`), and prove **uniqueness of the fold**:
    any function agreeing with the algebra on every constructor EQUALS `foldStmt`
    (`fold_unique`, `§4`). The payoff theorem `agree_by_initiality` (`§5`) is the N²→1 collapse
    IN ITS HONEST FORM: two readings that are BOTH folds of the SAME algebra are equal on EVERY
    term — no per-term/per-effect induction, by uniqueness alone. Non-vacuity: `fold_unique`
    CONSTRAINS — it forces agreement on a COMPOUND `seq` term from agreement on the
    constructors (`fold_unique_constrains`, `§6`).

  * (the OBSTRUCTION — why not full PASS) **The CURRENT `compile` (`Argus/Compile.lean:116`) is
    NOT a fold.** It is a top-level SHAPE MATCH —

        compile (.seq (.guard _) (.setCell _ _)) = transferVmDescriptor
        compile _                                = skipDescriptor

    — which inspects TWO levels of constructor and is NON-COMPOSITIONAL in `seq`: it does not
    factor as `compile (.seq s t) = ⟨compile s , compile t⟩`. We PROVE this is a genuine
    structural obstruction (`§7`): there is NO binary descriptor-combiner `⊕` making `compile`
    respect `seq`, because `compile (seq guard setCell) = transferVmDescriptor` (a 36-constraint
    real circuit) while `compile guard = compile setCell = skipDescriptor` (empty) — so any
    `⊕`-homomorphism would force `transferVmDescriptor = skipDescriptor ⊕ skipDescriptor`, a
    SINGLE fixed value, which cannot also equal `skipDescriptor` (the value `⊕` must give for
    `seq skip skip`). `compile` therefore does NOT ride initiality as written.

## What this MEANS for retiring the per-effect agreement proofs

The N²→1 collapse is **available exactly for readings expressed as folds** (genuine
`Σ`-algebra homs). `interp` qualifies TODAY. To make the executor⟺circuit agreement free
(retire the per-effect differential), `compile` must be REFACTORED into a fold —
`compileAlgebra : StmtAlgebra EffectVmDescriptor` with a real `seq`-combiner (descriptor
sequential composition) — at which point `agree_by_initiality` discharges executor⟺circuit on
ALL terms from agreement on the ~20 constructors, NOT N² per-effect lemmas. The probe's
deliverable is the precise gate: **the collapse is structural, not per-effect, the moment both
readings are folds; the one obstruction is the current non-compositional `compile` shape.**

/-! ## §1. The signature as an ALGEBRA — one operation per constructor.

A `Σ`-algebra on carrier `α` is a choice of one operation per `RecStmt` constructor, with the
recursive `seq` operation taking the carrier values of its two subterms. This is the polynomial
signature functor `Σ` reified as a record of operations: an `F`-algebra `Σ α → α`. The leaves
(`skip … allocCell`) carry their parameter data; `seq` is the binary node `α → α → α`. The
initial algebra of `Σ` is `RecStmt` itself (`Lean`'s inductive = initial algebra), and a
`StmtAlgebra α` is precisely the data inducing the UNIQUE hom `RecStmt → α` (the fold). -/

/-- **`StmtAlgebra α`** — a `Σ`-algebra structure on `α`: one field per `RecStmt` constructor.
The leaf fields are the constructors' operations (carrying their parameter data into `α`); `seqOp`
is the binary node. Choosing a `StmtAlgebra` is choosing how to INTERPRET each primitive — and the
fold (`§2`) is the unique extension to whole terms. -/

`foldStmt alg` is the catamorphism: it recurses on the term, applying the algebra's operation at
each node, with `seq s t ↦ seqOp (fold s) (fold t)` — the COMPOSITIONAL recursion that makes it a
homomorphism. This is the map `RecStmt → α` that initiality says is UNIQUE for each `alg`. -/

/-! ## §3. `interp` IS A FOLD — the KLEISLI home, made explicit.

The carrier is the Kleisli hom-set `State ⇸ State = RecordKernelState → Option RecordKernelState`.
Each leaf operation is the corresponding `interp` clause; `seqOp` is KLEISLI COMPOSITION
`f g k := (f k).bind g`. We prove `interp = foldStmt interpAlgebra` — so the executor reading is a
genuine `Σ`-algebra homomorphism, exactly as initiality requires. -/

initiality (the recursive node is pinned by the leaf agreements + the `seq` law). We use the

obstruction: there is NO binary descriptor-combiner `⊕` under which `compile` respects `seq` (i.e.
`compile` is provably NOT a `seqOp`-homomorphism for any `⊕`). The argument is a clean

Chaining, `transferVmDescriptor = skipDescriptor`, contradicting `transfer_ne_skip`. Hence `compile`

reading `comp'` is a homomorphism of the SAME algebra, then they AGREE on every term by initiality
— NO per-effect proof. This is the precise statement of what retiring the per-effect differential
costs: refactor `compile` into a fold (a `StmtAlgebra EffectVmDescriptor`), and agreement is free.
The hypothesis is exactly the thing `compile_not_a_seq_hom` shows the CURRENT `compile` fails. -/

/-! ## §Coda — THE VERDICT (PARTIAL).

  * **Categorical home**: `RecStmt` is the INITIAL algebra (in `Type`) of the polynomial signature
    functor whose operations are its constructors; the readings are FOLDS into the hom-set of the
    KLEISLI category `Kl(Option)` of partial state transformers `State ⇸ State` (the partiality =
    the `guard` effect, `seq` = Kleisli composition). This is the Freyd/Kleisli shape the register
    predicted — NOT a plain initial algebra in `Type` for the readings' target, but initiality of
    the TERM algebra with effectful folds.

  * **PASS half**: `interp` IS the unique fold (`interp_eq_fold`); uniqueness of the fold holds
    (`fold_unique`); and TWO folds of one algebra agree on ALL terms by uniqueness, no per-effect
    differential (`agree_by_initiality`). Non-vacuous: uniqueness forces a COMPOUND `seq` term
    (`fold_unique_constrains`).

  * **The OBSTRUCTION (why PARTIAL, not PASS)**: the CURRENT `compile` is NOT a fold — it is a
    non-compositional shape match, and `compile_not_a_seq_hom` proves NO `seq`-combiner makes it a
    homomorphism. So `compile` does not ride initiality AS WRITTEN.

  * **What it means for retiring per-effect proofs**: the N²→1 collapse is available EXACTLY for
    fold-shaped readings. `interp` qualifies today. Refactor `compile` into a fold
    (`StmtAlgebra EffectVmDescriptor` with a real descriptor-`seqOp`) and `fold_compile_would_collapse`
    discharges executor⟺circuit on ALL terms from agreement on the ~20 constructors. The collapse is
    STRUCTURAL, not per-effect — gated on one refactor, not N² lemmas.
