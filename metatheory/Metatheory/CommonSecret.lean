# Metatheory.CommonSecret — the COMMON SECRET: threshold-graded distributed knowledge.

A `K`-of-`N` Shamir secret sharing (SSS) scheme is usually framed weakly — *"`K` shares
RECONSTRUCT the secret"* — a single-point, operational reading. This module REFRAMES it as a
new **epistemic object**: a value the committee `G` *collectively holds as DISTRIBUTED
KNOWLEDGE* (the `D_G` modality of `Metatheory.EpistemicConsensus`) but that NO sub-threshold
subset, and no individual, knows. The secret becomes group-knowable **exactly at the threshold
`K`**, and below `K` it is **information-theoretically NOTHING**. We call this graded modality
`D_G^{≥K}` — *threshold distributed knowledge* — and the object it holds a **common secret**.

This is the epistemic DUAL of common knowledge: `C_G φ` is *"everyone knows that everyone knows
… φ"* — the supremum of the iterated-`E_G` tower (a fixpoint, limit-side); a common secret is
*"the group COULD know `φ` if it pooled `≥K` shares, but no proper sub-threshold part can"* — a
single `D`-style pooling, gated by a coalition-size THRESHOLD. Common knowledge climbs UP an
iteration to a binding ceiling; a common secret reaches ACROSS a coalition to a threshold floor.

It EXTENDS `Metatheory.EpistemicConsensus.Frame` (`Indist`, `Knows`, `DistKnows`,
`distKnows_mono_group`) — `D_G^{≥K}` is `DistKnows` evaluated at the threshold gate, NOT a new
Kripke primitive. The "Varieties of Distributed Knowledge" (Galimullin–Kuijer, AiML 2024) reading
is the right one: distributed knowledge is *hypothetical* — *"`φ` is `D_G` if the members COULD,
by combining their information, learn `φ`."* SSS is precisely the case where that pooling
SUCCEEDS at coalition size `≥K` and is information-theoretically VACUOUS below it.

DISCIPLINE: faithful Props, candidate-independent. The PROVED keystones are pinned
`#assert_axioms` (kernel-clean: only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`). The ONE
cryptographic obligation — that "a sub-threshold coalition's indistinguishability is TOTAL on the
secret-fiber" reflects an ACTUAL information-theoretic security (perfect privacy of the SSS scheme
below `K`) — enters ONLY as the `ThresholdFrame.subThreshold_blind` structural field, never as an
`axiom`/`sorry`. It is the EXACT analogue of the `Disclosure` separation parameter in
`ConstructiveKnowledge`/`EpistemicDial` (the crypto layer discharges the antecedent; the
metatheory says *if* the scheme is perfectly private below `K`, *then* the cliff holds). A
DISCRIMINATING concrete model (§5) certifies every keystone non-vacuous: a real 2-of-2 scheme
where neither share knows the secret yet the pair does.

/-! # §1. The threshold frame — a coalition-size gate over the epistemic frame

A `ThresholdFrame` is an epistemic `Frame` together with the committee `G`, the threshold `K`
(as a predicate `ReachesThreshold` on coalitions — "this coalition has `≥K` shares"), and the
two structural facts that make SSS what it is:

  * **monotone threshold** — a SUPERSET of a threshold coalition is still threshold (more shares
    never un-reaches the cliff); and
  * **sub-threshold blindness** — the *load-bearing crypto floor*: a coalition that does NOT
    reach threshold has its pooled indistinguishability TOTAL on the secret-fiber (it cannot
    rule out ANY value of the secret) — the information-theoretic security of the scheme below
    `K`, carried as a hypothesis, never an axiom.

We do not bake `K` as a `Nat`: `ReachesThreshold` is the abstract "is this coalition large
enough", so a richer monotone access structure (weighted shares, general monotone span programs)
instantiates the same laws. The `Nat`/cardinality reading is recovered by the concrete model §5. -/

/-- A **threshold frame**: an epistemic frame with a committee, a coalition-size gate, and the
SSS structural facts. The `secret : Ω → S` valuation reads each world's secret value (`S` = the
secret space); a proposition *about the secret* is `φ ∘ secret`-shaped, and "knowing the secret"
is distinguishing worlds with different `secret`-values. -/

  /-- **SUB-THRESHOLD BLINDNESS — the information-theoretic floor (THE crypto hypothesis).** A
  coalition `B` that does NOT reach threshold cannot distinguish the actual world from a world
  with a DIFFERENT secret value: for every alternative value `s`, there is a world `w'` that `B`
  jointly confuses with `actual` and whose secret is `s`. The pooled view of a sub-threshold
  coalition is consistent with EVERY secret — perfect privacy below `K`. This is carried as a
  STRUCTURAL FIELD (the scheme's perfect-secrecy guarantee), the exact analogue of the
  `Disclosure` separation parameter; the crypto layer discharges it, the metatheory consumes it. -/

and only sharpens its distributed knowledge (`distKnows_mono_group`). This is the "monotone in

and `¬ ReachesThreshold B`, then `¬ KnowsSecret B`. The secret is information-theoretically
NOTHING below `K`. The proof is the heart of the common-secret object: `subThreshold_blind` hands
us, for ANY alternative secret value `s ≠ secret actual`, a world `w'` that `B` confuses with
`actual` whose secret is `s` — so `B`'s pooled view cannot pin the secret. This is the EPISTEMIC
shadow of perfect SSS privacy: below threshold, every secret value remains possible.

It is the non-amplification tooth in epistemic clothes — the dual of `ConstructiveKnowledge`'s
`no_forge_step` (no authority appears below its production): here NO knowledge of the secret
appears below the production threshold `K`. -/

correctness: `N` shares reconstruct), then the committee `KnowsSecret`. This is the dual face of
the cliff: AT threshold (here, the full committee, which `committee_reaches`), the secret IS
group-known. Together with `subThreshold_secret_blind` this is the information-theoretic JUMP:
nothing below `K`, everything at `K`. `recoverable` is the scheme-correctness hypothesis (the
analogue of `committee_reaches` on the indistinguishability side). -/

/-! # §3. The duality to common knowledge — order-theoretic placement

`C_G` (common knowledge) is the GREATEST fixpoint of `E_G` (everyone-knows) — a LIMIT-side
ceiling reached by climbing an iteration UP. `D_G` (distributed knowledge) is, dually, the
group's pooled MEET — a single reach ACROSS the coalition. The common secret lives on the `D_G`
side, GATED by a threshold. The placement law: threshold distributed knowledge entails ordinary
distributed knowledge (the gate only removes the sub-threshold floor; it never adds beyond `D_G`)
— so `D_G^{≥K} ⊑ D_G ⊑ (no E_G/C_G of the secret below threshold)`. -/

/-- **`distKnowsGeK_imp_distKnows` — `D_G^{≥K}` is BELOW `D_G` in the knowledge order.** Threshold
distributed knowledge implies ordinary distributed knowledge: the threshold gate is a
RESTRICTION (it can only fail to fire), never an amplification past `D_G`. This places the common
secret strictly inside the `D` modality — it is a `D`-style object, not an `E`/`C` one. -/

/-- **`secret_not_everyone_knows` — the DUAL-TO-`C_G` content: a common secret is the OPPOSITE of
common knowledge.** No individual committee member (a singleton coalition, assumed sub-threshold —
the SSS non-degeneracy `K ≥ 2`) knows the secret. Where common knowledge `C_G φ` requires every
member to know `φ` (and to know that they know, …), a common secret requires every member to NOT
know it. This is the sharp epistemic duality: `C_G` is built from `E_G` (ALL members know);
the common secret guarantees `¬ Kᵢ secret` for each member — the anti-`E_G`, hence anti-`C_G`,
floor. -/

/-! # §4. The non-amplification BRIDGE — the common secret as the dual of `no_forge_step`

The cliff (`subThreshold_secret_blind`) is the epistemic dual of the authority
non-amplification of `ConstructiveKnowledge` (`no_forge_step`: no authority appears below its
production). We make the duality precise: in BOTH cases a quantity (authority / secret-knowledge)
is `⊥` below a production gate (held-rights / threshold) and present above it. The shared shape
is "nothing below the gate" — the information-theoretic / non-forgeability floor. -/

sub-threshold committee coalition `B` (with the SSS non-degeneracy: a real alternative secret

recoverability). The conjunction IS the cliff: a single coalition-size step (`B` ⊊ committee, `B`
below threshold) flips secret-knowledge from `⊥` to `⊤`. This is the non-amplification tooth: the
secret is `information-theoretically NOTHING` at `K−1` and `everything` at `K`. -/

/-! # §5. A DISCRIMINATING model — non-vacuity certificate (a real 2-of-2 common secret)

Every keystone above is over an abstract `ThresholdFrame`; a `∀`-quantified theorem can be
vacuously true. We rule that out with a CONCRETE 2-of-2 scheme over `GF(2)`-flavoured data:

  * the secret is a bit `s ∈ Bool`; two shares `a, b ∈ Bool` with `a ⊕ b = s` (the XOR/1-degree
    Shamir line over `𝔽₂`); a WORLD is a pair `(a, b)`, its secret `a ⊕ b`.
  * agent `0` sees only `a`; agent `1` sees only `b`. So agent `0` confuses `(a,b)` with `(a,b')`
    for ANY `b'` (it cannot see `b`), and dually agent `1`.
  * the coalition `{0,1}` (size 2) reaches threshold; any singleton (size 1) does not.

Then: NEITHER agent alone knows the secret (each confuses it with the world of opposite secret),
but the PAIR does (pooling `a` and `b` fixes `a ⊕ b`). This is a genuine common secret: held by
`{0,1}` as distributed knowledge, information-theoretically nothing to either share. -/
