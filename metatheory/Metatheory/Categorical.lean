# Metatheory.Categorical — deriving the abstract spec from categorical first principles.

`Dregg2.*` postulates its spec structures as fields or named constructions. This module
takes minimal categorical axioms and derives them as consequences.

- **§1 Conservation.** From "`Σ` is a lax monoidal functor `C ⥤ Discrete M`" we derive
  `Σ̃(A⊗B) = Σ̃A + Σ̃B` (tensorator `μ`) and `Σ̃ I = 0` (unit `ε`), recovering
  `Dregg2.Core.Conservation.tensor_add`/`unit_zero` as consequences. No-free-copy follows:
  a copy map `Δ : A ⟶ A⊗A` forces `Σ̃A = 0` in a cancellative `M`.
- **§2 The verify/find seam.** `Predicate ⊣ Witness` as a `GaloisConnection`; attenuation,
  demand/supply round-trips, and closure idempotence as standard adjunction consequences.
- **§3 Coalgebra and pullbacks.** The cell as an `F`-coalgebra; the hyperedge/JointTurn as
  a (wide) pullback — stated via `CategoryTheory.Limits`. Final-coalgebra existence is OPEN
  (closed in `Metatheory.Open.FinalCoalgebra`).

Honesty caveat (§1): functoriality into a discrete target is thin — the coherence diagrams
are vacuous (every diagram in a discrete category commutes). The honest content of
"conservation = a lax monoidal functor to `Discrete M`" is monoid-hom on counts plus
invariance on morphisms. We derive precisely that and no more.

/-! # §1. Conservation, derived from a lax monoidal functor to a discrete monoid.

`Dregg2.Core` postulates the conservation measure's two monoid-hom equations as fields.
Here we derive them from the single datum that conservation is a lax monoidal functor
`Σ : C ⥤ Discrete M` — extracted by reading off the coherence morphisms `ε`/`μ` through
`Discrete.eq_of_hom`. -/

def measure (Sig : C ⥤ Discrete M) (A : C) : M := (Sig.obj A).as

/-- The unit law `Σ̃ I = 0`, derived (not assumed). The lax-monoidal unit coherence morphism
`ε Σ : 𝟙_(Discrete M) ⟶ Σ.obj (𝟙_ C)` is, in a discrete category, an equality of objects
(`Discrete.eq_of_hom`). This recovers `Dregg2.Core.Conservation.unit_zero` as a theorem. -/

/-- The additivity law `Σ̃(A⊗B) = Σ̃A + Σ̃B`, derived (not assumed). The lax-monoidal

the equation `Σ̃ A = Σ̃ B`. Recovers `Dregg2.Core.conservation_ordinary` as bare

to a morphism forcing `Σ̃A = Σ̃A + Σ̃A`; in a cancellative `M` that gives `Σ̃A = 0`.
No conservation-respecting duplication of a non-empty resource is possible. This is the
categorical source of `Dregg2.Core.withholding_no_free_copy`. (We use the bare morphism
rather than `ComonObj` because `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Comon_` is not in this
lib's pinned mathlib slice; the argument needs only `Σ.map copy`.) -/

/-! ### §1(a): conservation is substructurality (the absence of a natural Δ).

`no_free_copy` shows a single copy morphism forces `Σ̃A = 0`. The structural reading:
- **Linear (no copy):** a family `δ A : A ⟶ A ⊗ A` forces every count to `0`. A
  cartesian (diagonal-bearing) structure is incompatible with non-trivial conservation.
- **Affine (no discard):** a discard `wk A : A ⟶ I` forces `Σ̃A = Σ̃I = 0`. Conservation
  tolerates neither contraction nor weakening — the linear discipline. -/

/-- No-free-discard (affine reading), derived. A discard `wk : A ⟶ 𝟙_ C` forces `Σ̃A = 0`

/-- A global diagonal collapses the whole measure (linear reading), derived. If `C` carries
diagonal components `δ A : A ⟶ A ⊗ A` for every object, then `∀ A, Σ̃A = 0`. Any

a cartesian monoidal category admits no faithful conservation. -/

  fun A => no_free_copy Sig A (δ A)

/-- A non-zero count forbids a global diagonal: a conservation functor with any non-zero
count witnesses that `C` is genuinely substructural (non-cartesian) on the resource
fragment. The absence of a natural copy and a non-trivial conservation are contradictory. -/

/-- Bridge to the postulated spec: every lax monoidal functor `Σ : C ⥤ Discrete M` induces
the monoid-hom data that `Dregg2.Core.Conservation` postulates as fields. `unit_zero` and
`tensor_add` are now theorems (`measure_unit`/`measure_tensor`). The full `Conservation`
structure additionally carries mint/burn bookkeeping (operational, not categorical); we
derive only the monoid-hom core. -/

/-! ### §1 inversion: the categorical view and the operational `Conservation` view are now
ONE theorem at two instantiations.

`no_free_copy` (this section, functor view) and `Dregg2.Core.withholding_no_free_copy`
(operational view) are **both** corollaries of `Dregg2.Core.noClone_of_invariant_tensor`.
We make that explicit: starting from a *real* `Dregg2.Core.Conservation M` (with the
operational `ConservesStep` discharged), the no-clone law for an ordinary copy turn is the
SAME general lemma the functor `Σ` route uses — only the `count`/`tensor`/invariance data
differ. The general theorem governs both; neither is a parallel re-proof. -/

/-- **The operational no-clone, re-derived inside Categorical from the SAME general lemma.**
Takes the real `Dregg2.Core.Conservation` and `ConservesStep`, and produces `count A = 0` for
an ordinary copy turn by applying `Dregg2.Core.noClone_of_invariant_tensor` — exactly the
lemma `no_free_copy` (functor view) applies. This witnesses, *at the metatheory level*, that
the abstract no-clone is the common parent of the categorical and operational facts (it is
definitionally `Dregg2.Core.withholding_no_free_copy`). -/
theorem operational_no_free_copy_via_general

    cons.count A = 0 :=
  Dregg2.Core.noClone_of_invariant_tensor cons.count cons.tensor cons.tensor_add A
    (Dregg2.Core.conservation_ordinary cons copy hcopy)

/-- The categorical and operational no-clone are the SAME general theorem: this `rfl`-level
agreement certifies that `operational_no_free_copy_via_general` is *definitionally* the real
`Dregg2.Core.withholding_no_free_copy`, not a look-alike. The inversion is structural. -/

/-! ### §1 honesty caveat.

`measure_unit`/`measure_tensor`/`measure_invariant` are the entire content of "`Σ` is a
monoidal functor to `Discrete M`": the coherence diagrams are vacuous (every diagram in a
discrete category commutes). We have derived monoid-hom + invariance, and only that. -/

/-! # §2. The verify/find seam, derived as a Galois connection.

We take "the seam is a `GaloisConnection demand supply`" as the single datum and derive
the seam's operational laws — attenuation, round-trips, closure idempotence — as standard
adjunction consequences. None is separately postulated; each is `GaloisConnection.*`. -/

/-- The verify/find seam as a single categorical datum: `realizes` and `verifies` form a

/-- Demand round-trip (adjunction counit): `realizes (verifies d) ≤ d`. Together with
`seam_unit` this is the full unit/counit of `realizes ⊣ verifies`. `GaloisConnection.l_u_le`. -/
theorem seam_counit (d : Demand) : S.realizes (S.verifies d) ≤ d :=

/-! ### §2 bridge: the abstract `Seam` is the REAL `Predicate ⊣ Witness` of `Dregg2.Laws`.

Previously the `Seam` structure was never instantiated — decorative. Here we build the ONE
`Seam` value from the real verifier: `Dregg2.Laws.predicate_witness_galois` is the formal-
concept (Birkhoff) polarity of the actual `Discharged` relation `Verify p w = true`. So
`realizes`/`verifies` are the real predicate/witness polars, and every `seam_*` lemma above
becomes a theorem *about the running verifier*, not an abstract toy. -/

`verifies B = {p | every witness in B discharges p}` (the lower polar); the adjunction is
the proved `predicate_witness_galois`. This is the single instance the audit asked for —

/-! # §4. Ordering / finality, derived as a bounded lattice.

Taking "finality is a `Lattice τ` and commit = the join `a ⊔ b`" as the single datum, the
mathlib lattice laws specialize to `Dregg2.Finality.Tier`: `crossTierJoin` is the lattice
join (`tier_commit_eq_crossTierJoin`), commit is monotone (`commit_monotone`), and
no-downgrade holds (`tier_crossTierJoin_no_downgrade`). The `commitAtMax_*_def` lemmas are

A real hyperedge binds N participants indexed by `ι` into one joint turn over `I`. The
categorical content is the wide pullback of the cospan `(πᵢ : Pᵢ ⟶ I)ᵢ`. We state the
universal property by hand (rather than via `HasWidePullback`) as a cone-with-unique-mediator

`WidePullbackShape ι = Option ι` is this diagram shape. -/

final iff from *every* cell `c` there is a coalgebra morphism into it (the **anamorphism**
`ana c`), and any two such morphisms agree (**uniqueness** — the heart of coinduction).
This is `Dregg2.Boundary`'s "live codata into which every behaviour unfolds" as a precise
predicate; the OPEN below is only whether such a `νF` *exists*. -/

coinduction principle: two states with the same `νF`-image are behaviourally equal. We

OPEN (`§3`, the anamorphism / final-coalgebra **existence** — now SHARPENED). The cell type
`Dregg2.Boundary` *wants* is the **final** `behaviour`-coalgebra `νF` — the unique behaviour
into which every coalgebra anamorphs (the "live codata, never bottoms out" of `§2`).

What is now PROVED (no longer open): the universal property is fully stated (`IsFinalCell`),
its **uniqueness half is a theorem** — the anamorphism is unique (`ana_unique`, the
coinduction principle) and the final object is canonical up to a carrier round-trip
(`final_unique_roundtrip`), both *conditional on finality*, which is the genuine categorical
content of coinduction. The category of `F`-coalgebras has identities (`cell_self_bisim`)
and composition (`CoalgHom.comp`). The hyperedge has its (wide) pullback universal property
PROVED (`wideJointTurn_universal`/`wideJointTurn_mediator_unique`).

What remains OPEN is **strictly the construction of the carrier** — an *inhabitant* of
`IsFinalCell` for `F X = Obs × (Adm → X)`:

    ∃ νF : Cell Obs Adm, IsFinalCell νF

The precise named categorical lemma the construction needs is one of:
  * **Adámek's terminal-coalgebra theorem** — `νF = lim (… → F²1 → F1 → 1)`, the limit of
    the ω^op-chain of `F`-iterates of the terminal object, which converges because
    `F X = Obs × (Adm → X)` preserves ω^op-limits (it is a finite product of a constant and
    a representable, both continuous); or
  * a **guarded-recursion `▷` backend** giving `νF` as a coinductive type directly.
Either is a module of its own (needs `CategoryTheory.Limits` ω-chains, not built here as a
ready `HasLimit` instance for this `F`). We do NOT axiomatize it; we have moved the OPEN from
"what is `νF`?" to "construct the carrier; its universal property and uniqueness are done."
The behavioural content the system actually uses — bisimulation-as-coalgebra-morphism,
reflexivity, composition, and the step-completeness safety invariant — is already proved
(`cell_self_bisim`/`CoalgHom.comp`/`ana_unique` here; `stepComplete_preserves` in
`Dregg2.Boundary`) without needing `νF` to exist. Concretely the missing existence fact is:

    a terminal object `νF` in the category `(Cell Obs Adm, CoalgHom)` exists

— i.e. a cell `νF` together with, for every cell `c`, a UNIQUE coalgebra morphism
`anaF c : CoalgHom c νF` — from which the anamorphism and its uniqueness (the coinduction
principle underlying `Dregg2.Boundary.IsBisim`) would follow. We do NOT axiomatize it; we
record it as the precise open hypothesis the full derivation still needs. The *behavioural*
content the system actually uses — bisimulation-as-coalgebra-morphism, reflexivity, and the
step-completeness safety invariant — is already proved (`cell_self_bisim` here;
`stepComplete_preserves` in `Dregg2.Boundary`) without needing `νF` to exist. -/

/-! # §6. The boundary law as a square — tying the verify-seam (§2) to the cell (§3).

§2 derived the verify/find seam as a `GaloisConnection realizes ⊣ verifies`; §3 derived the
cell as an `F`-coalgebra with observation `Cell.obs`. They meet at the **cell boundary**: a
cell observes a *demand*, and each state is backed by a *supply*. The "boundary law" of
`Dregg2.Boundary` — that a cell's observation is *consistent with* what its supply verifies —
is DERIVED here as a **commuting square** that is *precisely the seam adjunction read at the
coalgebra's observation*. No separate boundary postulate: §3's observation passes through
§2's adjunction by construction. -/

whenever the demand a state observes is realized by its supply (`realizes (adm x) ≤ obs x`),

/-! # Coda — how this moves the spec from postulated toward derived.

`Dregg2.Core.Conservation` postulates `unit_zero`/`tensor_add` as *fields*; here
(`measure_unit`/`measure_tensor`) they are **theorems** about a lax monoidal functor
`Σ : C ⥤ Discrete M`. **The inversion is now load-bearing:** `no_free_copy` (functor view)
and `Dregg2.Core.withholding_no_free_copy` (operational view) are BOTH corollaries of the
single `Obj`-polymorphic lemma `Dregg2.Core.noClone_of_invariant_tensor` — the cancellation
argument lives once, the two concrete facts are instantiations, not parallel proofs
(`operational_no_free_copy_via_general` exhibits the operational one inside this file, and
`operational_no_free_copy_is_withholding` certifies it is *definitionally* the real Dregg2
theorem). `Dregg2.Laws` constructs the `Predicate ⊣ Witness` connection; the abstract `Seam`
is now **instantiated by it** (`predicateWitnessSeam`, built from `predicate_witness_galois`),
so its operational laws (attenuation, round-trips, closure) are **consequences** of the seam's
defining `GaloisConnection` *applied to the real verifier* (`real_verify_*`), not an
uninstantiated structure.
`Dregg2.Boundary` gives a structure map; here the cell is an `F`-coalgebra and the hyperedge
a **pullback** — now also a **wide pullback** for N participants (`wideJointTurn_universal`/
`wideJointTurn_mediator_unique`) — with the binding's universal property PROVED and only the
final-coalgebra existence (`νF`) honestly OPEN (its uniqueness/coinduction, `ana_unique`, is
proved *conditionally on finality*).

**The three judgements, each now a categorical structure.** §1 conservation is
*substructurality* — the absence of a natural diagonal `Δ`/discard is conservation
(`diagonal_collapses_measure`/`no_free_discard`, the linear/affine reading). §4 derives
`Dregg2.Finality`'s **second judgement** (ordering/finality) as a **bounded lattice**: the
cross-tier commit is the lattice *join* (`commitAtMax = crossTierJoin`), *no-downgrade IS
monotonicity* (`commit_monotone`), and the ladder is bounded (`tierBoundedOrder`, with the
derived `OrderTop`/`OrderBot` `Dregg2` leaves implicit) — the mathlib lattice/`BoundedOrder`
laws specializing to the Tier order, the `commitAtMax_*_def` lemmas being join-unfolds beneath
the `Tier`-touching results. §5 derives `Dregg2.Confluence`'s **third judgement** (I-confluence)
as a **sub-join-semilattice**: `IConfluent` and `closed-under-⊔` are the same condition under
two names (`iconfluent_eq_closed_def`, a definitional unfold), with the coordination-free
fragment exhibited as a
join-subalgebra (`confJoin`/`confJoin_lub`) and tier-1 eligibility shown to BE that closure
(`tier1Eligible_closedUnderJoin`). §6 ties §2⊗§3: the **cell-boundary law is the seam
adjunction read at the coalgebra's observation** (`seamConsistent_of_adj`) — not an extra
postulate, the adjunction itself.

The honest caveat (`study-category §5`): the conservation derivation's target is *discrete*,
so it is **thin** — what is genuinely derived is *monoid-hom + invariance*, the real content
the `Dregg2.Core` docstring already names; the "strong monoidal functor" packaging is
decorative and we do not oversell it. The §4/§5 lattice derivations are honest order theory
(no thinness caveat); the §6 boundary square is the genuine adjunction, faithfully
transported. The ONE deep OPEN remains the final-coalgebra *existence* (Adámek / guarded
recursion), with its universal property and uniqueness already proved. This is a START at
"the abstract spec is derived from categorical first principles," substantially advanced —
all three judgements are now derived structures, not postulates — but not the finished
derivation. -/
