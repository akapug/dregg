//! # spween → cell compiler (v0)
//!
//! Lowers a parsed spween [`Scene`] into a deployable dregg **world-cell descriptor**:
//! a slot layout (passages/vars → cell slots) and a [`CellProgram`] whose
//! per-choice cases encode each `Choice.condition` as an **executor-enforced
//! predicate**. After deploy, a choice's gate is not a client-side courtesy —
//! it is a `dregg_cell::CellProgram` case the verified executor re-checks on the
//! choice-turn's post-state, so a client cannot present an ineligible choice as
//! taken (SPWEEN-ON-DREGG §3, property 3).
//!
//! ## The slot layout — and the WIDE PLANE past the 16th
//!
//! * slot [`PASSAGE_SLOT`] (0): the current passage index (the `RuntimeState`
//!   control-flow position, made cell state). [`PASSAGE_ENDED`] marks a finished
//!   scene.
//! * slots `1..`: one per numeric/bool variable named in a condition or effect,
//!   then one per `category.key` membership atom. Assignment is deterministic
//!   (sorted names) so a re-compile of the same scene yields the same layout.
//! * **keys [`SPILL_EXT_BASE`]`..`: the overflow.** The cell has 16 fixed registers
//!   ([`STATE_SLOTS`]), so slot 0 + 15 named atoms fill it. A scene naming MORE does
//!   NOT fail — the 16th and every later atom SPILLS to an **ext key**, an unbounded
//!   `key >= STATE_SLOTS` that `Effect::SetField` routes into the cell's COMMITTED
//!   `fields_map` (digested into `fields_root`, folded into the cell commitment). The
//!   spill is a suffix of the same deterministic order, so the first 15 named atoms of
//!   a wide scene land in exactly the registers they would have had, and a scene that
//!   fits (`<= 15`) compiles BYTE-IDENTICALLY to before — no ext key, no new tooth.
//!
//! ### Resolve BY NAME, never by a guessed index
//!
//! [`CompiledStory::var_slots`] / [`CompiledStory::has_slots`] are the name→**key**
//! mapping: a value `< STATE_SLOTS` is a fixed register, `>= STATE_SLOTS` is an ext
//! key. Consumers MUST look a var up by name ([`CompiledStory::var_key`]) — a
//! hardcoded index that happens to be right for a narrow scene points at the WRONG
//! atom in a wide one (a prior lane found that naively repointing hardcoded indices
//! INVERTS gates). [`CompiledStory::is_spilled`] answers "which plane is it on".
//!
//! ### What the ext plane costs (design against these — they are not hidden)
//!
//! * **O(n) per ext write.** `CellState::set_field_ext` rebuilds the ENTIRE
//!   `fields_root` (sorted-Poseidon2 over every map entry) on every write — there is no
//!   incremental cache (unlike the heap's `HeapTreeCache`). A register write is O(1).
//!   This is why the first 15 atoms stay in registers: the fast plane is filled first.
//! * **~31-bit per-value binding.** Each `fields_root` leaf folds its 32-byte value to
//!   ONE ~31-bit BabyBear felt. The root is ~124-bit (8 felts) and the `fields_map`
//!   holds the full 32 bytes the teeth read, but the per-value BINDING in the committed
//!   root is the known ~31-bit umem boundary. A story var is a small counter, so the
//!   projection ([`crate::value_to_u64`]) is well inside it — but the boundary is real.
//! * **Executor-enforced, NOT in-circuit-proven.** The ext-plane atoms
//!   (`HeapField`/`HeapFieldLteOther`) are evaluated by the host scalar evaluator
//!   (`cell::program::eval`); the slot-caveat PI vector cannot express a heap key, so
//!   they carry NO AIR teeth (`turn/src/executor/mod.rs`). A register `FieldGte` DOES
//!   project into the circuit. Both are re-checked by the real executor on every turn —
//!   which is exactly what an executor-refereed game needs — but a spilled gate must
//!   NOT be described as in-circuit-proven.
//!
//! ### Same teeth on both planes
//!
//! Every gate a register var lowers to has an ext-plane equal, so a var that spills
//! keeps its bite (`FieldGte`→`HeapField{Gte}`, `FieldLte`→`{Lte}`,
//! `FieldEquals`→`{Equals}`, the clamp-companion `FieldDelta`→`{DeltaEquals}`,
//! cross-var `FieldLteOther`→`HeapFieldLteOther`). The ext atoms are STRICTER in one
//! way: on the heap, **absent ≠ present-zero** — a `HeapField` over an unwritten key
//! REFUSES. A register is born present-zero, so to keep the two planes'
//! semantics identical [`crate::WorldCell`] BIRTHS every compiled ext key at
//! field-zero on deploy (the same setup write `seed_var` uses). Without that, an
//! unseeded spilled var would refuse gates its register twin admits — a play-vs-replay
//! split.
//!
//! ## The gate lowering (a condition → a post-state predicate)
//!
//! A choice's `condition` is checked against the *pre*-state, but a
//! [`StateConstraint`] bites on the *post*-state. Because the compiler knows a
//! choice's own effects at compile time, it lifts a pre-state gate to an
//! equivalent post-state one: for a gate var with net additive delta `d` from the
//! choice's effects, `pre ≥ T  ⟺  post ≥ T + d` (the choice does not otherwise
//! touch the var). A gate whose var is *`Set`* by the same choice (post is a
//! constant, independent of pre) cannot be lifted — that clause is left to the
//! runtime/handler gate and no executor constraint is emitted for it. `Compare`
//! against a string/float literal is likewise handler-only in v0. The numeric/bool
//! gates (`courage >= 5`, `gold >= 100`, `inventory.key`) lower to real executor teeth.
//!
//! ## VAR-OP-VAR gates (a cross-variable tooth)
//!
//! A comparison whose RHS is another VARIABLE (`{ gold >= "$price" }`, `{ hp <= "$cap"
//! }`) lowers to a real CROSS-SLOT tooth — [`StateConstraint::FieldLteOther`]
//! (`new[a] <= new[b] + delta`) — instead of falling back to the handler gate, so a
//! cross-variable gate BITES on the verified executor (a broke buyer whose `gold` is
//! below the dynamic `price` is REFUSED, not merely hidden client-side). The current
//! git-pinned spween grammar parses a comparison's RHS only as a literal, so the
//! var-reference rides the closest expressible form — a quoted string with a `$` sigil
//! (see [`var_ref`]); a native `var op var` is the noted parser follow-up. See
//! [`cross_var_teeth`] for the pre→post lift and its clamp guard.
//!
//! ## The clamp caveat (why a same-var decrement needs an exact-delta companion)
//!
//! The `pre ≥ T ⟺ post ≥ T+d` identity assumes the choice applies its delta
//! *exactly*: `post = pre + d`. But the executor CLAMPS a `Modify` at zero
//! (`post = max(0, pre + d)`, so `hp -= dmg` never underflows). When the choice
//! DECREMENTS the gate var (`d < 0`) and the shifted threshold lands `≤ 0`, that
//! clamp collapses the lifted gate to a vacuous `≥ 0`: `{ gold >= 50 } ~ gold -= 50`
//! lifts to `FieldGte(gold, 0)`, ALWAYS TRUE — a broke buyer's purchase clamps the
//! purse to `0 ≥ 0` and commits (goods delivered, purse silently zeroed). For
//! exactly those clamp-defeated gates (see `lift_defeated_by_clamp`) we PIN the
//! delta with a companion [`StateConstraint::FieldDelta`]`{ index, d }`: a clamped
//! underflow lands `0 ≠ old + d` (u64 lane, wrapping) and is REFUSED, so the
//! pre-gate bites exactly. When the shifted threshold stays `> 0` the comparison
//! itself catches an underflow (`{ hp >= 21 } ~ hp -= 20` ⇒ `FieldGte(hp, 1)`), so
//! NO companion is emitted — a case whose delta is overridden at runtime (dice
//! combat reuses that same case with a *rolled* hp delta) is not over-pinned. A
//! gate on a var the choice does not touch (`d = 0`) is unchanged.
