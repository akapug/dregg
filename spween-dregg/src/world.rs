//! # The `WorldCell` binding + the stock-runtime driver
//!
//! A spween story/world is a dregg **cell** holding the narrative vars. This module
//! implements spween's [`EffectHandler`](spween::EffectHandler) over that cell and
//! exposes the two ways a story advances:
//!
//! * [`WorldCell::apply_choice`] — the low-level primitive: a chosen `Choice` lands
//!   as **one cap-bounded turn** (its effects → cell writes, its target → the passage
//!   slot), admitted by the real [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor).
//!   The executor re-checks the choice's installed gate case, so an *ineligible* pick
//!   is refused in-band — nobody can take a choice they are not eligible for, and
//!   nobody can forge another's move. The collective-vote loop and the forge/gate
//!   teeth drive this path.
//! * [`Driver`] — runs the **stock `spween::Runtime`** over a [`CellHandler`]
//!   (spween's own `EffectHandler`, backed by the cell): each `select_choice` becomes
//!   a real turn and the playthrough is a receipt chain. This is single-player
//!   verifiable CYOA with the unmodified engine.
