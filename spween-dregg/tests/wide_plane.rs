//! **THE 16-SLOT LIMIT IS NOT REAL** — a scene needing more than 16 story variables
//! compiles, deploys, and keeps every tooth.
//!
//! The compiler used to HARD-FAIL a wide scene (`CompileError::TooManySlots`) while the
//! architecture underneath carried unbounded keys already: `Effect::SetField { index >=
//! STATE_SLOTS }` routes into the cell's committed `fields_map` / `fields_root` (an
//! openable sorted-Poseidon2 root folded into the cell commitment), and that plane is
//! CONSTRAINABLE — `HeapField { key, atom }` and `HeapFieldLteOther` are executor teeth.
//! The knowledge was in-tree; the compiler never learned it. It has now: past the 16
//! registers a var SPILLS to an ext key and its gates lower to the ext-plane twins.
//!
//! These tests DRIVE that, against the real `EmbeddedExecutor`:
//!
//! 1. a >16-variable scene COMPILES and DEPLOYS (was `TooManySlots`);
//! 2. the layout is the deterministic one: 15 registers filled first, the rest spilled,
//!    resolved BY NAME (never by a guessed index);
//! 3. a spilled var ROUND-TRIPS through real turns, and the committed `fields_root`
//!    MOVES when it does;
//! 4. every gate class still BITES on a spilled var — the plain comparison, the
//!    clamp-defeat exact-delta companion, the cross-var relation, and membership — each
//!    driven to a real `WorldError::Refused` with the illegal move committing NOTHING;
//! 5. the `<= 16` path is UNCHANGED (no ext key, no ext tooth, same layout);
//! 6. the heap hatch cannot reach a spilled var (the confinement widened with the story).
//!
//! ## What is honest about a spilled gate
//!
//! An ext-plane tooth is EXECUTOR-enforced, not in-circuit-proven: the slot-caveat PI
//! vector cannot express a heap key, so `HeapField`/`HeapFieldLteOther` are evaluated by
//! the host scalar evaluator (`turn/src/executor/mod.rs` names this boundary rather than
//! hiding it), while a register `FieldGte` DOES project into the AIR. Every refusal
//! below is the real executor refusing a real signed turn — which is what an
//! executor-refereed game runs on — and none of it is a claim of in-circuit proving.
