//! # dreggnet-council — a COLLECTIVE-GOVERNANCE offering (propose → vote → enact).
//!
//! The fourth DreggNet [`Offering`], beyond the game (`dungeon`), the agent
//! (hosted-Hermes), and the grain (Sandstorm). Its per-session thing is a
//! **council over a real cell**: the SAME `open / actions / advance / verify /
//! render / price` shape that hosts a dungeon playthrough here hosts a governance
//! flow. That is the point — the [`Offering`] abstraction is not narrative-shaped;
//! it carries any confined, verifiable, per-session thing whose moves are real
//! executor turns. A council is that thing for collective decisions.
//!
//! ## The model — three affordances over one substrate
//!
//! An [`advance`](Offering::advance) is one of three governance moves, keyed by the
//! [`Action::turn`] verb:
//!
//! - **PROPOSE** (`turn = "propose"`, `arg` = a catalog index) — a council member
//!   opens a proposal: a per-option-gated `reject / approve` poll on the real
//!   [`collective_choice`] engine (gated on APPROVE, at the council quorum `M`), and
//!   a committed council-cell turn recording the opening. Lands a real
//!   [`TurnReceipt`].
//! - **VOTE** (`turn = "approve"` / `"reject"`, `arg` = a proposal index) — a member
//!   casts a **single-use, write-once ballot**. The ballot's `WriteOnce(VOTE)` + the
//!   engine nullifier make a second vote a real refusal; a non-member holds no ballot
//!   cap and is refused ([`collective_choice::VoteError::Ineligible`]). A cast lands a
//!   real [`TurnReceipt`]; a double-vote / non-member is [`Outcome::Refused`].
//! - **ENACT** (`turn = "enact"`, `arg` = a proposal index) — attempts the decision.
//!   The quorum **`AffineLe` gate inside the engine is the real referee**: below quorum
//!   the engine refuses the decision-turn ([`collective_choice::VoteEngine::resolve`]
//!   yields `None`) and ENACT is [`Outcome::Refused`] — **nothing is applied**. At
//!   quorum with APPROVE the winner, the proposal's **real effect** (a `WriteOnce`
//!   policy-slot write on the council cell) commits as one executor-refereed turn →
//!   [`Outcome::Landed`]. A second enact of the same proposal is refused (already
//!   enacted / the executor's `WriteOnce`).
//!
//! The executor is the SOURCE OF TRUTH on both substrates: the vote board is a
//! monotone tally of real ballot turns (a light client recomputes it), and the
//! enactment is a real committed cell-state change. A jailbroken narration cannot
//! move the treasury; only a passed vote can.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! The effect an enacted proposal applies here is a **cell-state change**: it writes
//! the proposal's `value` into a per-catalog `WriteOnce` policy slot on the council
//! cell (a policy flag / a treasury parameter / an authorization bit). That is a real,
//! executor-refereed, verifiable effect. A *fuller* governance offering would let a
//! proposal carry a richer effect — a capability **grant** to a named cell, a fund
//! **transfer**, a cross-cell program install, or a parameterized method call — and
//! would add proposal lifecycle (amend / withdraw / expire), delegated ballots (the
//! engine already supports non-amplifying delegation), and a constitutional amendment
//! path. The abstraction is unchanged; only the enacted [`Effect`] set widens.
//!
//! ## Weighted councils
//!
//! [`CouncilOffering::new_weighted`] opens the SAME three affordances over the
//! engine's **weighted** primitives instead of the plain ones — nothing here
//! hand-rolls a weight tally:
//!
//! - PROPOSE opens the poll with [`collective_choice::VoteEngine::open_poll_weighted_gated`],
//!   so `quorum_m` becomes a **WEIGHT** threshold on APPROVE (`M·RESOLVED −
//!   TALLY_approve ≤ 0` over weight-bumped tallies) and the `CountGe` floor drops to
//!   one genuine distinct approver — a member whose grant alone clears `M` is a
//!   legitimate quorum, while a forged tally jump with no real voter still cannot arm
//!   `RESOLVED`.
//! - VOTE casts with [`collective_choice::VoteEngine::cast_weighted`], so the member's
//!   whole granted weight rides **ONE** nullifier (never `W` weight-1 ballots — that
//!   is the amplification the delegation lattice forbids). A second cast at any weight
//!   is the same [`VoteError::DoubleVote`] refusal as the classic council.
//! - A **zero-weight** member is refused fail-closed by the engine's
//!   [`VoteError::ZeroWeight`] floor *before* the ballot turn, so a worthless cast
//!   never consumes their single-use ballot.
//!
//! The electorate of a weighted poll is dynamic at the ENGINE layer (eligibility is
//! meant to be the caller's verified grant), so the council keeps its own membership
//! gate: an actor outside [`CouncilSession::members`] is refused in
//! [`advance`](Offering::advance) before any ballot is minted.
//!
//! The weight itself is **granted upstream** — this crate consumes it, it does not
//! prove it. Where the number comes from (a proven on-chain holding, a bot-recorded
//! standing, a charter) is the caller's claim to make honestly.
//!
//! An unweighted council is unchanged in every respect: it opens `open_poll_gated`,
//! casts plain `cast`, and [`CouncilSession::member_weight`] reads a uniform `1`.
