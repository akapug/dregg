//! Proof-carrying capability exercise for sovereign cells.
//!
//! This module enables peer-to-peer capability exercise without federation mediation.
//! Alice holds a capability to Bob's cell; she proves she holds it and sends the proof
//! along with the requested effect directly to Bob. Bob verifies locally and executes.
//!
//! Protocol:
//! 1. Alice proves: "my state contains a capability with these permissions for Bob's cell"
//! 2. Alice sends Bob: (her proof, the requested effect)
//! 3. Bob verifies: proof shows Alice holds a valid cap, effect is within permissions
//! 4. Bob executes the effect on his own cell
//!
//! The `SignedAttestation` variant is the initial implementation (both parties
//! online). A future ZK variant (where the holder doesn't reveal the slot) is
//! tracked in the slot-caveats design; it is intentionally **not** carried as
//! a typed placeholder here, because the prior `StarkMembership` variant had
//! no real verification path — `verify(...)` accepted it on signature alone,
//! which is an authority-amplification hazard. The variant has been removed.
//! When the swiss-table membership gadget lands, reintroduce the variant
//! alongside a working verification path in the same patch.
