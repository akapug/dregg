//! lean_producer_wide_field.rs — **THE WIRE-CARRIER FALLBACK, CLOSED** (both poles, live FFI).
//!
//! # What used to happen
//!
//! `lean_shadow::field_fits_wire_carrier` required `field[0..24] == 0` because the wire projection
//! (`field_to_i128`) read only the low 8 bytes. So a turn writing a FULL 32-byte state field — a
//! digest, a `cell_tag`, an `ELECTORATE_ROOT`, an execution-lease `PROVIDER_SLOT` — was
//! `effect_is_mappable == false`, hence not marshallable, hence
//! `produce_via_lean → Fallback { Ineligible }`: the VERIFIED producer never ran and the unverified
//! Rust executor decided and committed the turn. The refusal was correct (truncating would have
//! been worse) but it was a live, daily-reachable hole in the verified path.
//!
//! # What happens now
//!
//! The carrier is `marshal::WideInt` — a 256-bit magnitude, exactly the width of a `FieldElement`,
//! and exactly the width the Lean `Int` on the far side always had. The projection is TOTAL, so the
//! turn is covered, the verified Lean executor DECIDES it, and its post-state is INSTALLED.
//!
//! # Anti-vacuity
//!
//! "It no longer falls back" is satisfiable by making the shadow accept everything, so every test
//! here asserts WHAT WAS INSTALLED, not merely that something committed:
//!   * the outcome is `LeanAuthoritative` (the Lean verdict is the authority), and
//!   * the committed ledger's root EQUALS the `lean_root` the outcome reports — i.e. the state in
//!     the ledger is the one the VERIFIED executor produced, not Rust's, and
//!   * the field itself is the full 32 bytes (the thing the old carrier could not carry).
//!
//! Requires the linked Lean archive; self-skips when absent (PANICS under `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`).
