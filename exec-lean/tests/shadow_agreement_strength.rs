//! shadow_agreement_strength.rs — **ASSERT THE STRENGTH, not just the bit.**
//!
//! # The standing hole this closes
//!
//! `ShadowAgreement` exists precisely to stop the harness calling a commit-bit coincidence "full
//! executor agreement": `FullState { agreed }` is a genuine CELL-BY-CELL denotational comparison of
//! the verified Lean executor's reconstituted post-state against the Rust one; `CommitBitOnly` is
//! the honestly-weaker check for turns off the root-agreeing set.
//!
//! ⚑ Until this file, **no test anywhere asserted which one a real turn produced** — the strength
//! was only ever `tracing`-logged, and the production entry point threw it away (`let _ = …` at the
//! single call site — that entry point is now DELETED, 2026-07-30). That is exactly how an always-red `FullState` detector survived NINE DAYS: it
//! compared a BLAKE3 sub-ledger root against an 8-felt whole-context anchor, so
//! `FullState { agreed: false }` fired on every honest turn and the warning meant nothing. A
//! detector no test can read is a detector no test can find broken.
//!
//! Both faces are pinned here against the LIVE FFI:
//!   * `FullState { agreed: true }` on a root-agreeing turn both executors commit — the strong
//!     claim, and the one that was stuck false;
//!   * `CommitBitOnly` on a turn OUTSIDE the root-agreeing set — the honestly-weaker claim, so a
//!     future change that quietly promoted everything to `FullState` fails here.
//!
//! No env var, no thread-local: the comparison is driven through `shadow_agreement_for` with
//! explicit pre/post ledgers. Since 2026-07-30 that is the ONLY way in — the `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW`
//! entry point is deleted, and the cell-level comparison it carried decides
//! `ProducerDivergence::PostStateCell` on the armed producer seam.
//!
//! Requires the linked Lean archive; self-skips when absent (PANICS under `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`).
