//! THE ARMED verified-rejection tooth — the verified Lean executor as the AUTHORITATIVE decision on
//! the commit path, through the mechanism that is actually turned on.
//!
//! ## What this replaces, and why
//!
//! `exec-lean/tests/lean_strict_veto.rs` used to pin the same divergence through
//! `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1` + `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW_STRICT=1` and the veto inside
//! `TurnExecutor::execute`. Both variables were set by NOTHING in the repo outside that test —
//! whole-tree sweep including `.github/`, `docker/`, `deploy/`, every `.service`/`.env`, every
//! `Dockerfile`/compose file, and every Rust `env::set_var` — so that gate decided nothing anywhere.
//! It was also DOMINATED: `lean_apply::produce_via_lean` (THE SWAP authority inversion, ON by
//! default on native via `DREGG_LEAN_PRODUCER`) installs the verified verdict in BOTH directions,
//! not merely as a one-way tightening.
//!
//! And it was BROKEN. Measured 2026-07-28 against the linked archive: the veto restored the ledger,
//! the factory registry and the FNSP admission slot, but NOT the agent's receipt-chain head, which
//! `execute_without_shadow` had already advanced. A vetoed turn therefore left the executor
//! expecting a `previous_receipt_hash` for a receipt that was never issued and can never be
//! produced, and the agent's next honest turn was refused
//! `ReceiptChainMismatch { expected: Some(d250…), got: None }` — permanently. That mechanism was
//! deleted; this file pins the same semantics on the path that runs, INCLUDING the receipt-head
//! restoration the deleted path got wrong.
//!
//! ## The tooth
//!
//! The divergence is the under-authorised `Burn`: dregg1's `apply.rs` commits a burn on an owned
//! open cell, while the verified `.burnA` requires an explicit mint/burn cap (`mintAuthorizedB`).
//!
//! Run (single-threaded not required — no env mutation):
//!   DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1 cargo nextest run -p dregg-exec-lean \
//!       --test lean_producer_verified_rejection --test-threads=4
