//! rust_lean_parity_gauntlet.rs — THE consolidated Rust↔Lean executor PARITY GAUNTLET.
//!
//! This is the single, runnable justification artifact behind shipping the RUST executor
//! (`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor::execute` → `turn/src/executor/apply.rs`) to the SDKs *by default*,
//! with the verified ~150MB Lean kernel (`Dregg2.Exec.recKExec`, reached via `dregg-lean-ffi`) as an
//! opt-in shadow. It runs ONE corpus of turns through BOTH executors and, turn-by-turn, records:
//!
//!   * accept/reject parity   — does the Rust commit bit equal the verified Lean commit bit?
//!   * post-state parity      — when BOTH commit, is the post-state BYTE-IDENTICAL? (per-cell
//!                              balance + nonce + the state fields + `cap_root`, AND the whole
//!                              ledger `.root()` — the Merkle commitment a light client checks).
//!
//! The corpus covers the full effect COHORT (transfer / set-field / grant / attenuate / mint /
//! burn / revoke / note / lifecycle / sovereign / refusal / archive), edge cases, and an adversarial
//! should-reject battery. Each turn classifies into one verdict:
//!
//!   * `BothAcceptStateAgree`   — both commit AND the post-states are byte-identical. THE good
//!                                result: Rust reproduced the verified kernel's exact transition.
//!   * `BothReject`             — both refuse. The good result for an adversarial turn.
//!   * `BothAcceptStateDiverge` — both commit but the post-states DIFFER. A SILENT STATE BUG: Rust
//!                                committed a *different* state than the verified spec. HARD FAIL —
//!                                this is the worst outcome for ship-Rust and must never occur.
//!   * `RustAcceptsLeanRejects` — Rust commits a turn the verified kernel REFUSES. The ship-Rust
//!                                under-enforcement direction. HARD FAIL unless the cohort is on the
//!                                documented `SAFE_DIRECTION_RESIDUALS` allowlist (each entry carries
//!                                its exact Lean gate + why it is a known, characterised residual; in
//!                                the deployed shadow-gated node the verified verdict is authoritative
//!                                and vetoes the commit, so these are SAFE there — for the pure-Rust
//!                                SDK they are the honestly-named residuals, see docs).
//!   * `RustRejectsLeanAccepts` — Rust is STRICTER than the verified kernel (the safe divergence
//!                                direction: Rust refuses some turns the spec would admit). Reported,
//!                                never failed.
//!   * `WireGap`                — the turn is not marshallable to the Lean wire, so it cannot be
//!                                differentially compared. Reported as a gap, never faked.
//!
//! HARD-FAIL conditions (the gauntlet's teeth):
//!   1. ANY `BothAcceptStateDiverge`                       — a silent state divergence.
//!   2. ANY `RustAcceptsLeanRejects` whose cohort is NOT on the allowlist — a NEW under-enforcement.
//! Plus a non-vacuity floor: the corpus must produce a meaningful number of `BothAcceptStateAgree`
//! and at least one `BothReject`, so the gauntlet cannot pass by trivially gapping/rejecting.
//!
//! Requires the linked Lean archive; when `lean_available()` is false it self-skips UNARMED and
//! PANICS under `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` (`demand_lean`) — it cannot run the verified kernel without it. The strengthened justification is documented in
//! `docs/RUST-LEAN-EXECUTOR-PARITY.md`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p dregg-exec-lean --test rust_lean_parity_gauntlet -- --nocapture`
