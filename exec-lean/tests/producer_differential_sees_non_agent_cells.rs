//! THE PRODUCER DIFFERENTIAL IS NO LONGER ANCHOR-BLIND — and the blindness is measured, not
//! asserted from a docstring.
//!
//! ═══ WHAT WAS OPEN ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//! `produce_via_lean` runs the verified Lean executor as the AUTHORITY and the legacy Rust
//! executor as a demoted REFERENCE, then reports whether the reference reproduced the verified
//! verdict. Until 2026-07-30 that comparison was exactly two values: the commit bit, and
//! `TurnExecutor::consensus_state_commitment`.
//!
//! **The anchor is a per-AGENT-cell commitment.** `state_commit::consensus_state_commitment`
//! commits the AGENT's cell under a `V9RotationContext` whose only whole-ledger component is
//! `rotation_witness::cells_root` — a tree whose leaves are EXISTENCE BITS (`BabyBear::ONE`), never
//! a cell's value. So two post-states that differ only in a transfer RECIPIENT's balance produce
//! byte-identical anchors, and the differential reported `rust_agreed: true` for them.
//!
//! A predicate that DID catch that existed — `lean_shadow::post_states_agree`, a cell-by-cell
//! comparison — but it was reachable only from `maybe_shadow_turn`, gated on `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1`,
//! which was set by nothing in the tree outside one test; and its verdict was discarded at the
//! single call site (`let _ = …`). Two independent reasons it decided nothing. It was moved onto
//! this armed seam as [`ProducerDivergence::PostStateCell`] and the dark path was deleted.
//!
//! ⚠ The same blindness is true of the receipt's signed `post_state_hash`, which is that same
//! anchor value. That is a LARGER residual than this file closes and it is NOT closed here —
//! `turn/src/state_commit.rs` already labels it ("a per-cell commit, not the whole-ledger snapshot
//! the BLAKE3 root was"). What this file establishes is that the Lean↔Rust DIFFERENTIAL no longer
//! inherits it.
//!
//! ═══ THE POLES ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//! 1. `the_anchor_cannot_see_a_non_agent_cell` — the blindness itself, MEASURED against a real
//!    `TurnExecutor`. Without this the rest is a claim about a hypothetical.
//! 2. `a_non_agent_cell_divergence_is_caught_by_the_post_state_leg` — same two ledgers, and the
//!    differential returns `PostStateCell` naming the right cell. Poles 1+2 together are the
//!    strength: leg 2 passed, leg 3 refused.
//! 3. `agreeing_post_states_are_agreement` — the non-vacuity guard. A differential that returned
//!    `Some(..)` for everything would satisfy pole 2 and is refused here.
//! 4. `an_honest_turn_is_decided_as_agreement_and_the_lean_state_is_installed` (needs the archive)
//!    — the ADMIT pole through the real producer: `LeanAuthoritative { divergence: None }` by
//!    variant, AND the verified verdict was INSTALLED (the write is on the ledger and the receipt
//!    attests the Lean root), not merely computed.
//! 5. `a_verified_refusal_is_decided_as_a_commit_bit_divergence` (needs the archive) — the REFUSE
//!    pole through the real producer: `divergence == Some(CommitBit { lean: false, rust: true })`
//!    matched by VARIANT, the rejection reason matched by VARIANT, and the ledger back at the
//!    pre-state. Asserting the variant is what distinguishes "the differential ran and answered"
//!    from "something went wrong" — a `Fallback` outcome is a different variant and fails here.
//!
//! Run: `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1 cargo nextest run -p dregg-exec-lean \
//!        --test producer_differential_sees_non_agent_cells`
