//! **THE RECEIPT-CHAIN HEAD IS A NODE, SO IT NEEDS COLLISION RESISTANCE — AND IT HAD 64 BITS.**
//!
//! The verified kernel's `admissible` ChainHead leg is a `Nat` equality,
//! `h.prevReceipt = ctx.storedHead` (`Dregg2/Exec/Admission.lean`). Both operands are unbounded
//! `Nat`s in Lean. Until this file's flag day, **Rust folded both to their low 64 bits** before
//! they crossed:
//!
//! * `lean_shadow.rs`'s `stored_head_nat = bytes32_to_nat(&head)` — bytes `[24..32]` of the host's
//!   real 32-byte head;
//! * `lean_shadow.rs`'s `prev_hash = Digest::from_u64(bytes32_to_nat(&h))` — the turn's CLAIMED
//!   32-byte prev, narrowed to the same 8 bytes.
//!
//! The comment defending it said the two paths "compare like-for-like", which is TRUE and is a
//! statement about *path agreement*, not about *fidelity*. What the verified leg actually decided
//! was `low64(claimed) = low64(stored)` — an equivalence whose fibers hold `2^192` values each.
//!
//! ## The cost, derived — and it is NOT a birthday bound
//!
//! `Turn::previous_receipt_hash : Option<[u8; 32]>` is agent-supplied and carries no structural
//! obligation: nothing anywhere requires it to be the hash of anything. So the adversary is not
//! searching for a collision, they are **naming a member of a known fiber**. Given the true head
//! `H` (which an honest agent must already know to build an honest turn), every `X` with
//! `X[24..32] == H[24..32]` is accepted, and `X = H ^ (1 << 255)` is one XOR away.
//!
//! * **2^0** — one operation, zero hash evaluations. This is the deployed cost, and the number
//!   that belongs in the finding.
//! * 2^64 would be the cost if the claimed prev had to be a GENUINE receipt hash the adversary can
//!   produce (grind receipts until one folds onto a target head) — a targeted second-preimage on
//!   the fold.
//! * 2^32 would be the birthday cost of two genuine receipts of the adversary's own colliding
//!   under the fold, with no target.
//!
//! Neither of the last two applies here. Quoting one of them would be the flattering-number sin.
//!
//! ## Why it was not merely "instrumented"
//!
//! Producer mode (`produce_via_lean`, default-ON via `DREGG_LEAN_PRODUCER`) makes the Lean verdict
//! AUTHORITATIVE: on a covered turn, `lean_committed` installs the Lean post-state **and overrides
//! a Rust rejection**. The Rust reference does compare all 32 bytes
//! (`TurnExecutor::check_previous_receipt_hash`), and its refusal did surface — as
//! `ProducerDivergence::CommitBit` on an `error!` log line labelled *"the Rust path is BUGGY"*.
//! The turn still committed. `build_producer_committed_result` then minted a receipt carrying
//! `previous_receipt_hash: turn.previous_receipt_hash` — the adversary's value verbatim — SIGNED
//! it, and **advanced the executor's stored head onto it** (`finalize.rs`'s `record_receipt_hash`).
//!
//! ⚑ That is the consequence in the kernel's own vocabulary. `Admission.admissible_append_wellLinked`
//! preserves `wellLinked` across an admitted turn *given* `(head of chain) = headDigest ctx`. Under
//! the fold, `headDigest ctx` was `low64(H)` while the chain's real head hash was `H`, so the
//! hypothesis was false on the deployed path and the tamper-evidence conclusion did not transfer.
//! The chain could accept — and permanently keep — a node whose `prevHash` is the hash of nothing.
//!
//! So the fold was a reachable authority hole on the default production path, not a gap held shut
//! by a cross-check.
//!
//! ## What this file pins
//!
//! * NON-VACUITY — the demoted Rust reference, alone, refuses the fold sibling (so the refusal
//!   below is not one Rust would have made for some other reason).
//! * COMPLETENESS — an honest head still crosses the shadow and both executors still agree.
//! * THE TOOTH — the fold sibling is REFUSED by the authoritative verified verdict, on a turn the
//!   verified producer genuinely decides (`LeanAuthoritative`, never a `Fallback`).
//!

/// a 64-bit proof — the exact stuck-veto bug this closes."* Every OTHER credential arm still
/// presents exactly that shape. `auth_to_wire`'s bearer arm emits
/// `WireAuth::Bearer { deleg_msg: Digest, deleg_sig: u64 }`, and
/// `FullForestAuth.portalVerify (.bearer msg sig _) = CryptoKernel.verify msg sig` is `msg == sig`
/// under the reference portal — so a real delegator pubkey (256 bits) can never echo a 64-bit
/// `deleg_sig`. `Token`, `Custom`, `Stealth` and `CapTpDelivered` have the same `Digest`-vs-`u64`
/// pairing.
///
/// This test does not assert that is WRONG — the direction is fail-CLOSED, which is the safe one.
/// It exists so the claim is MEASURED rather than derived from the types, because bearer roots are
/// deliberately inside `produce_via_lean`'s covered set (`forest_agent_reaches_roots` admits them)
/// and a permanently-refusing WHO leg there is an availability fact someone should own. Reported,
/// not repaired: widening those arms is the credential-portal lane's call, not this one's.
