//! lean_producer_agent_reach.rs — THE AGENT-REACH FENCE (issue #56).
//!
//! The deepest hole in the verified-producer swap: the wire model binds the acting principal as
//! `actor := action.target` (`lean_shadow::tree_to_wforest`), and the Lean authority gate
//! `stateAuthB` = `authorizedB { actor, src := target, dst := target }` SHORT-CIRCUITS on the owner
//! disjunct `actor = src`. So for a root whose `action.target` differs from `turn.agent`, the Lean
//! model authorizes the write as if the TARGET cell were self-writing — with NO capability edge.
//! But the DEPLOYED Rust executor enforces AGENT-REACH (`execute_tree.rs:451`): for a root, the
//! agent must OWN the target, hold a c-list edge, or carry a bearer proof — else `CapabilityNotHeld`.
//!
//! Without a fence, a turn where agent W targets a cell R it does not own and holds no edge to would
//! be REJECTED by Rust but COMMITTED by Lean, and the default-on producer (`produce_via_lean`) would
//! INSTALL that cross-cell write the authority model forbids — a soundness hole.
//!
//! TIER-1 FENCE (this file): `forest_is_root_agreeing` additionally requires every root to satisfy
//! `turn.agent == action.target` OR carry a bearer proof (`forest_agent_reaches_roots`). An
//! agent≠target non-bearer root is fenced OUT of the covered set onto the Rust producer, which
//! enforces agent-reach. This is a pure SAFETY-NET tightening — Rust already decides these; the
//! fence only stops the verified producer from LOOSENING past Rust.
//!
//! Teeth:
//!   * FALSIFIER (`hole_agent_targets_unreachable_cell_is_fenced`): the exact hole scenario — the
//!     producer must NOT commit it (falls to Rust → `CapabilityNotHeld`), matching Rust. Removing
//!     the fence flips the outcome to `LeanAuthoritative { committed: true }` — the canary fails RED.
//!   * LIVENESS-SELF (`legit_self_write_still_commits`): agent == target STILL commits under the
//!     verified producer (`LeanAuthoritative`) — the fence does not over-reject.
//!   * LIVENESS-EDGE (`legit_cross_cell_with_cap_edge_still_commits`): agent ≠ target but the agent
//!     HOLDS a c-list edge — Rust commits it, so the fenced-to-Rust turn STILL commits (no liveness
//!     regression; the fence routes it, it does not kill it).
//!
//! Requires the linked Lean archive; self-skips when absent (PANICS under `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`).
