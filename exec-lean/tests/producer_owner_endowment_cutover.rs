//! ⚑ THE OWNER-ENDOWMENT CUTOVER — the `GrantCapability` shape the verified kernel used to refuse.
//!
//! ## The turn
//!
//! `Effect::GrantCapability { from: A, to: B, cap: CapabilityRef { target: A, .. } }` where `A`'s
//! c-list is EMPTY — which is every cell's FIRST grant, because `Cell::new`/`Cell::with_balance`
//! mint a cell with no capabilities.
//!
//! * **dregg1 COMMITS.** `apply_grant_capability` (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:760`) short-circuits
//!   a self-grant: `if cap.target == *from { /* skip c-list lookup */ }`. A cell is the ORIGIN of
//!   authority over itself.
//! * **The verified kernel COMMITS TOO, as of 2026-07-31.** `recKDelegate`
//!   (`metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/AuthTurn.lean`) gates on
//!   `t = delegator ∨ (k.caps delegator).any (fun cap => confersEdgeTo t cap) = true`. The left
//!   disjunct is the base case; abstractly it is `Spec.Origin` (`Dregg2/Spec/Authority.lean`), the
//!   self-reference arm of the capability dynamics, confined by `Origin.over_self` to caps
//!   targeting the originator.
//!
//! ## What this file replaced
//!
//! `producer_owner_endowment_fence.rs`. Until the kernel carried the disjunct, `caps = fun _ => []`
//! was a FIXPOINT of the modelled authority calculus — no rule created a first edge — so the
//! verified gate refused the first grant every cell ever makes, and the shape was FENCED out of the
//! swap-safe covered set (`lean_shadow::first_unmodelled_authority_origin_effect`, reason
//! `AUTHORITY_ORIGIN_GAP`). That fence, its predicate and its named reason are **DELETED**: a fence
//! whose premise has become false is a permanent detour, not a safeguard.
//!
//! ## What this file pins — both poles, by VARIANT, over the LIVE FFI
//!
//! * `owner_endowment_is_verified_and_commits` — the endowment is back INSIDE the covered set
//!   (`forest_is_root_agreeing`), is decided by the VERIFIED kernel (`LeanAuthoritative`, asserted
//!   by variant, never `is_ok()`), commits, and the cap actually lands.
//! * `cross_cell_grant_without_a_held_edge_is_still_the_verified_kernels_refusal` — ⚑ **the
//!   load-bearing pole.** The amplification-relevant half — a cross-cell grant where the granter
//!   holds NO edge to the target — is still `LeanAuthoritative { committed: false }`. A cutover
//!   that admitted the owner AND the forger would be worse than no cutover.
//! * `ffi_admits_the_owner_and_refuses_the_forger_by_variant` — both poles in ONE test over ONE
//!   pre-state, driving `execute_via_lean` (the real kernel, not the coverage gate): same cap
//!   target, same recipient shape, same empty c-lists, **only `from` varies**. This is the Rust
//!   witness of `owner_admitted_forger_refused_same_target` in `AuthTurn.lean`.
//! * `endowment_is_no_longer_fenced_out_of_the_covered_set` — the flipped burn-down. The old file's
//!   tooth asserted the kernel STILL refuses; this asserts it no longer does, so a silent
//!   regression of the kernel gate (or a re-introduced fence) goes red here.
