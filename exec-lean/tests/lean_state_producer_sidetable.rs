//! lean_state_producer_sidetable.rs — DISSOLVED-VERB WIRE REFUSAL: the factory-dissolved
//! holding-store verbs (`cesc`/`cobl` — the old escrow/obligation kernel ops) are gone from the
//! verified kernel (F1b deleted `RecordKernelState.escrows`; their semantics live in factory-born
//! cells, `Dregg2/Apps/{EscrowFactory,ObligationFactory}`). The kernel no longer PARSES those wire
//! actions — so a STALE OR MALICIOUS PEER whose bytes still carry one must be refused LOUDLY at
//! the wire (`committed == false` or the strict-parser sentinel), NEVER silently skipped-and-committed
//! (a silent accept would install a post-state the sender never authorized — parse-confusion).
//!
//! SUBSTRATE: the decider here is the VERIFIED LEAN kernel — `Dregg2.Exec.FFI.execFullForestAuthStep`
//! (`@[export] dregg_exec_full_forest_auth`), reached through `shadow_exec_full_forest_auth`. This
//! file is Rust HARNESS only: it builds a wire, mutates one tag, and reads the verdict. No admission
//! or parse logic is authored here.
//!
//! # Mechanism, and the ONE non-vacuity obligation
//!
//! A refusal tooth is worthless against a baseline that was already refusing. So each refusal test
//! FIRST asserts, IN THE SAME PROCESS, that the honest wire is ADMITTED and COMMITS
//! (`status == BodyCommitted`, `reason == Admitted`), then swaps its `{"bal":[...]}` action tag for
//! a dissolved (`cesc`/`cobl`) or unknown (`zzzz`) tag and asserts the verified kernel refuses the
//! mutant — and refuses it for the RIGHT reason (the strict `parseWWire` fails ⇒ the empty-state
//! malformed-wire sentinel), not for some unrelated error that merely happens to be an `Err`.
//!
//! # ⚠ WHY THE FIXTURE IS BUILT HERE AND NOT SCAVENGED FROM THE CONFORMANCE CORPUS
//!
//! This tooth previously took its baseline from `dregg_lean_ffi::marshal::conformance_input_corpus()`
//! by scanning for a case that both carried a `bal` action and committed. **No such case has ever
//! existed.** That corpus is the MARSHALLING translation-validation corpus: its only obligation is
//! that `marshal_turn_hosted` reproduces the Lean-emitted golden BYTE-FOR-BYTE
//! (`dregg-lean-ffi/src/marshal_conformance.rs`, which additionally asserts the Rust and Lean case
//! NAMES are set-equal). It is deliberately full of shapes chosen to exercise the ENCODER — negative
//! amounts, absent agents, escaped field names — and its envelope builder `conf_turn_of` has carried
//! `prev = 0xDEADBEEF` against a `stored_head = 0` host since the corpus was born (`c6c3eb2e9`,
//! 2026-06-13), which is a `ChainHeadMismatch` at admission. Measured 2026-07-29: all 49 corpus cases
//! are REJECTED — 44 `NonceMismatch`, 3 `Underfunded`, 1 `ChainHeadMismatch`, 1 `NoSuchAgent`; not one
//! reaches a body. Adding a committing case to that corpus is also not the fix: it would break the
//! byte-for-byte golden join until `metatheory/EmitMarshalGolden.lean` is re-emitted, and it would
//! make an encoder corpus answer a semantics question. So the semantic fixture lives HERE, explicitly.
//!
//! HISTORY. `5fe426a0d` (2026-07-16) rewrote this file from a zero-test husk into the real tooth, and
//! its own commit message records `⚠ RUNTIME-VERIFICATION PENDING for this one file — the lane hit
//! disk ENOSPC then a build-lock queue and could not run it in-session`. The "find a committing corpus
//! case" premise was never executed, so all four tests have been RED since the day they were written,
//! and the panic message they carried ("the corpus lost its committing Balance case") was that lane's
//! own unverified guess — later inherited by two more lanes as if it were a diagnosis. The corpus lost
//! nothing.
//!
//! Requires the linked Lean archive; self-skips unarmed and PANICS under
//! `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` (`demand_lean`) when the archive is absent.
