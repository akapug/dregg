//! The shadow executor's durable NULLIFIER accumulator (VK-epoch stage E2, Path B).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! The cumulative double-spend frontier, held as the DEPLOYED Poseidon2 sorted-Merkle indexed tree
//! ([`dregg_circuit::heap_root::CanonicalHeapTree8`]) rather than the legacy BLAKE3
//! `dregg_cell::nullifier_set::NullifierSet`. On a committed `NoteSpend` the shadow executor
//! advances the deployed `nullifier_root` (circuit limb 26) — the sorted-compacted
//! [`CanonicalHeapTree8::root8`] (byte-identical to the producer's
//! [`dregg_circuit::heap_root::compute_canonical_heap_root_8`]). The insert itself is the DEPLOYED
//! IMT insert [`CanonicalHeapTree8::insert_witness_aafi`] — the proven `imtInsert` lineage: it
//! brackets the fresh key by the low leaf's pointer gap (`low.addr < k < low.next_addr`), so a
//! present key (or a sentinel / out-of-bracket collision) yields `None` — a FAIL-CLOSED
//! double-spend: the root does NOT advance and the spend is refused.
//!
//! # Adapting to main's IMT shape (why `insert_witness_aafi`, not `insert_witness`)
//!
//! Main evolved `HeapLeaf` to the arity-3 indexed-Merkle-tree leaf `(addr, value, next_addr)` (the
//! gap-#5 IMT closure, mirror of the proven Lean `Dregg2.Circuit.IndexedMerkleTree.imtInsert`) and
//! DROPPED the separate MAX-sentinel leaf — MAX survives only as the terminal `next_addr` pointer.
//! As a consequence the sorted-compacted [`CanonicalHeapTree8::insert_witness`] cannot append a
//! NEW-MAXIMUM key (it needs a strict successor leaf, which no longer exists), and a nullifier
//! accumulator appends new maximums constantly. The pointer-bracketing
//! [`CanonicalHeapTree8::insert_witness_aafi`] handles every fresh in-range key (MIN's pointer is
//! MAX, so the first insert brackets), and it is the PROVEN `imtInsert` path — the more faithful
//! primitive. Main keeps TWO parallel commitment lineages pre-cutover: the sorted-compacted
//! `root8` (what the producer currently commits at limb 26) and the append-ordered AAFI root
//! ([`AafiInsertWitness8::new_root`], the layout the eventual atomic AIR cutover will commit). This
//! accumulator advances the DEPLOYED sorted-compacted `root8` and ALSO surfaces the AAFI witness.
//!
//! # Why Path B (the soundness story)
//!
//! The advance runs in RUST here for speed. Its soundness is banked by the VERIFIED Lean spec, not
//! re-derived at runtime:
//!
//!   * `Dregg2.Circuit.SortedTreeNonMembershipHeap8` (`nonMembership_sound8` / `update_sound8`) and
//!     the IMT `imtInsert_preserves` / `imtLowUpdate_binds` are the proven insert + non-membership; and
//!   * `Dregg2.Exec.NullifierAccumulator.present_no_witness` is the proven fail-closed gate — an
//!     adversary CANNOT supply an insert/gap witness for an already-present key.
//!     (Both LANDED on main: `metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/NullifierAccumulator.lean` +
//!     `NullifierAccumulatorKernelBridge.lean`, and `Circuit/SortedTreeNonMembershipHeap8`.)
//!
//! The Rust face of the low-leaf opening (`imtLowUpdate_binds`) is checked inline via
//! [`recompose_membership_8`] over the AAFI witness's low-leaf membership path. The full
//! `dregg_nullifier_advance` FFI KAT (Lean `advanceRoot8Exec` = the deployed recompose) is the
//! GATED wire-codec tail (it rebuilds the Lean seed) — it lands with the ember-gated VK-epoch flip.
//!
//! # Scope (stage E2, items 1+2 — NOT the wire-codec fork)
//!
//! This holds + advances the deployed `nullifier_root` in the shadow executor state ONLY. It does
//! NOT yet thread the root into the published commitment / `WireState` / VK — that is item 3 (the
//! wire-codec fork: a `WireState.nullifier_root` field, the faithful 8-felt commitment feed, and the
//! VK regen). Until then the accumulator is observed + held; it does not gate the commit decision.
