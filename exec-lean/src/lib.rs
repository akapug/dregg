//! `dregg-exec-lean`: the verified-Lean-FFI executor cluster.
//!
//! This native-only crate holds ALL the Lean-FFI executor code that `dregg-turn` used to carry
//! behind the (now-deleted) `no-lean-link` feature:
//!
//! - [`lean_shadow`] — the MARSHALLER and the Lean↔Rust comparison predicates, as a library. It
//!   runs nothing by itself. Two decisionless entry points that used to drive it from the
//!   production execute path have been deleted rather than kept beside the armed one: the
//!   `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW_STRICT` veto (2026-07-28 — armed nowhere, and its rollback left the agent's
//!   receipt head advanced to a receipt that was never issued) and the `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW`
//!   differential itself (2026-07-30 — the variable was set by nothing, and the single call site
//!   dropped the verdict with `let _ =`). The comparison's strength moved onto [`lean_apply`].
//! - [`lean_apply`] — the authoritative state PRODUCER: `produce_via_lean` installs the verified
//!   Lean post-state and commit verdict UNCONDITIONALLY (the authority inversion), demoting the
//!   Rust executor to a checked reference — and, since 2026-07-30, running the CELL-BY-CELL
//!   post-state differential the dark path used to carry ([`ProducerDivergence`]).
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! `dregg-turn` defines [`dregg_turn::ShadowObserver`] (a `Send + Sync` trait) and holds an
//! `Arc<dyn ShadowObserver>` in its `TurnExecutor`, defaulting to `NoOpShadowObserver`. This crate
//! provides [`LeanShadowObserver`], which implements it. A native node injects it via
//! `TurnExecutor::with_shadow_observer(Arc::new(LeanShadowObserver))`; a wasm / no-FFI build simply
//! does not depend on this crate and keeps the no-op default.
//!
//! ⚑ What that seam carries is now exactly one thing: the DURABLE nullifier frontier advance on a
//! committed `NoteSpend`. It is a real production side effect, and it is the only reason the trait
//! still exists — the differential it also used to carry is gone (see above).
