//! `dregg-exec-lean`: the verified-Lean-FFI executor cluster.
//!
//! This native-only crate holds ALL the Lean-FFI executor code that `dregg-turn` used to carry
//! behind the (now-deleted) `no-lean-link` feature:
//!
//! - [`lean_shadow`] — the differential OBSERVER: it marshals a turn through the verified Lean
//!   kernel and compares its commit decision (and, on the swap-safe root-agreeing set, its full
//!   reconstituted post-state root) against the legacy Rust executor, WITHOUT affecting the
//!   `TurnResult`. It is also the binding strict-veto REJECTION authority (`DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW_STRICT`).
//! - [`lean_apply`] — the authoritative state PRODUCER: `produce_via_lean` installs the verified
//!   Lean post-state and commit verdict UNCONDITIONALLY (the authority inversion), demoting the
//!   Rust executor to a checked reference.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! `dregg-turn` defines [`dregg_turn::ShadowObserver`] (a `Send + Sync` trait) and holds an
//! `Arc<dyn ShadowObserver>` in its `TurnExecutor`, defaulting to `NoOpShadowObserver`. This crate
//! provides [`LeanShadowObserver`], which implements that trait by delegating to the moved
//! `lean_shadow` free functions. A native node injects it via
//! `TurnExecutor::with_shadow_observer(Arc::new(LeanShadowObserver))`; a wasm / no-FFI build simply
//! does not depend on this crate and keeps the no-op default. That dependency choice — not a feature
//! flag — is what selects the verified shadow/gate executor.

/// holds the DURABLE nullifier accumulator ([`ShadowNullifierAccumulator`], VK-epoch stage E2 Path
/// B): a per-executor cumulative double-spend frontier advanced on every committed `NoteSpend`.
/// This is the cross-turn executor state — the observer lives for the node's lifetime inside the

/// root is exposed via [`Self::nullifier_root`] / [`Self::nullifier_root_faithful`] — the seam the
