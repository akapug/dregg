//! The Lean-backed CONSERVATION ORACLE — routes the deployed executor's per-asset `Σδ = 0` gate
//! through the verified, Lean-authored `dregg_cross_cell_conserves`
//! (`Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConserveDecision.conservesFFI`) instead of the hand-written Rust
//! `dregg_circuit::block_conservation::BlockConservation` twin.
//!
//! House Law #1 for the inflation boundary: the deployed conservation decision is COMPUTED BY the Lean
//! source, proved EQUAL to the committed `Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConservation` AIR boundary
//! (`creditSum = debitSum` per asset) by `CrossCellConserveRefine.decision_conserves_iff_air_boundary` /
//! `satisfied_imp_decision_conserves` — so the route-through and the proof the prover commits to cannot
//! drift. `dregg-turn` cannot link `libdregg_lean.a` (wasm32 + zkVM guest), so — like the
//! `ConstraintOracle` — this backend lives here (the crate that DOES link the archive) and is installed
//! by `dregg-node` at native startup.
