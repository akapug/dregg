//! Lean FFI marshalling + the Lean↔Rust DIFFERENTIAL COMPARISON, as a library of pure entry
//! points. Nothing here runs itself: every function is called by a consumer that decides.
//!
//! ⚑ **THE `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW` ENTRY POINT IS GONE — 2026-07-30.** `maybe_shadow_turn`,
//! `capture_pre_state_if_eligible`, `shadow_enabled` and the `SHADOW_PRE`/`SHADOW_HOST`/
//! `SHADOW_BLOCK_HEIGHT` thread-locals implemented a differential that ran on the production
//! execute path gated on `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1`. The variable was set by NOTHING in the tree
//! outside one test (swept four ways: 26 workflows, every Dockerfile/compose/k8s file, 7 systemd
//! units, every Rust `env::set_var`), so the comparison never ran on a deployed node — and the
//! single call site discarded its verdict (`let _ = maybe_shadow_turn(..)`), so it decided nothing
//! even when armed.
//!
//! Its one genuine strength was [`post_states_agree`]: a CELL-BY-CELL comparison of the verified
//! Lean post-state against the Rust one. That is strictly stronger than what the ARMED seam had —
//! `produce_via_lean` compared `consensus_state_commitment`, which binds the AGENT's cell in full
//! but every other cell only by an EXISTENCE BIT (`rotation_witness::cells_root` leaves are
//! `BabyBear::ONE`), so a Lean↔Rust divergence in, say, a transfer RECIPIENT's balance was
//! invisible to it. The predicate was therefore MOVED onto the armed seam
//! ([`crate::lean_apply::produce_via_lean`], where it decides `ProducerOutcome::divergence`) and
//! the dark entry point deleted rather than kept beside it.
//!
//! What remains here and IS consumed: [`shadow_agreement_for`] (the harness entry, pinned by
//! `exec-lean/tests/shadow_agreement_strength.rs`), [`shadow_report`] (the corpus
//! divergence-finder), [`run_shadow_state`] / [`build_pre_ledger`] / the marshaller (the verified
//! PRODUCER's own path), and [`last_admission_reason`] (read by `produce_via_lean` so a verified
//! rejection names the gate that refused).
//!
//! # Scope: full multi-action FORESTS (no longer single-`SetField`)
//!
//! The shadow marshals the WHOLE Rust call-forest through the gated FFI
//! `shadow_exec_full_forest_auth`. A turn's forest is pre-order flattened into a chain
//! of wire actions; the chain is carried as a single root `WForest` whose tail nodes are
//! `null`-cap delegation children — the Lean executor runs `null`-cap children
//! SEQUENTIALLY against the evolving state WITHOUT invoking the cap-handoff gate
//! (`execFullChildrenA`'s `capTarget = none` branch), which is exactly "run these actions
//! in order, all-or-nothing." That faithfully models the Rust executor's pre-order forest
//! walk for the `DelegationMode::None` default (every node acts under its own authority).
//!
//! A turn is shadowed only when EVERY effect maps to a wire action and every referenced
//! cell has a ledger snapshot — anything unmappable makes the turn INELIGIBLE (skipped,
//! never silently mis-encoded; a dropped effect is worse than no shadow at all).
//!
//! The credential WHO-leg crosses faithfully: `Signature`/`Custom`/`Token`/`Bearer`/…
//! carry their FULL 256-bit digests via `marshal::Digest` (not a zeroed low-u64), so the
//! gate is genuinely exercised through the wire.

/// circuits on the OWNER disjunct `actor = src`. So for a root whose `action.target` differs from

/// NO capability edge required. But the Rust executor enforces AGENT-REACH: for a root, the agent
/// (the root's `parent_cell`) must OWN the target (`target == agent`), hold a c-list edge to it, or
/// carry a bearer proof — else `CapabilityNotHeld` (`execute_tree.rs`'s top-of-action gate, measured
/// 2026-08-06 at `:823-921`; this cited `:451` and had drifted). When agent ≠ target and
/// the agent holds no edge, Rust REJECTS while Lean COMMITS; the default-on producer would then
/// INSTALL a cross-cell write the authority model forbids.
///
/// The producer gate cannot see the ledger here (no c-list to test the edge), so it fences
/// CONSERVATIVELY on the two shapes the wire model provably mirrors:
///   * `turn.agent == root.action.target` — the owner disjunct is FAITHFUL (agent acts on its own
///     cell); Rust's `target == parent_cell` short-circuit and Lean's `actor = src` agree.
///   * the root is BEARER-authorized — Rust bypasses the c-list check (`is_bearer_auth`) and the
///     wire carries the bearer WHO-leg, so authority is the carried proof, not agent-reach.
///
/// Any OTHER root (agent ≠ target, non-bearer) is fenced OUT of the covered set: it falls to the
/// Rust producer, which enforces agent-reach (committing the legitimate agent-holds-the-edge case,
/// rejecting the unreachable one). This is a pure SAFETY-NET tightening of which turns the verified
/// producer INSTALLS for — no production behavior change (Rust already decides these), it only stops
/// the producer from loosening past Rust. Decided identically in both builds (no FFI, no ledger).
///
/// # ⚑ THIS FENCE IS ALSO WHAT CARRIES THE SNAPSHOT-AUTHORITY MODELLING GAP — read before widening
///
/// **The verified kernel models exactly one authority store, and Rust has two.**
/// `Dregg2/Exec/Kernel.lean:51`'s `authorizedB` is three disjuncts over the LIVE c-list —
/// `actor = src`, a `node src` cap, or an `endpoint src` cap carrying `write` — and it reads
/// `caps turn.actor` and nothing else. Rust's `Cell::resolve_authority_at` (`cell/src/cell.rs:779`)
/// resolves over the c-list AND `Cell::delegation`, a `DelegatedRef` snapshot, tagging the result
/// `AuthoritySource::Clist` / `AuthoritySource::DelegationSnapshot`. Three production sites mint a
/// snapshot (`apply_spawn_with_delegation`, `apply_refresh_delegation`, and `execute_tree`'s
/// `DelegationMode::SnapshotRefresh` chain-walk auto-install), and `ledger_to_wire_state` carries
/// **only the c-list** across (see its `edges` projection) — so the wire could not express the
/// second store even if the kernel had a slot for it.
///
/// **DECIDED (2026-08-06): a delegation snapshot is NOT an authority edge, and must not become
/// one.** The argument is from what `authorizedB` is *for*, not from cost. `confersEdgeTo`
/// (`Exec/AuthTurn.lean:31`) is literally `authorizedB`'s `.any` body, and `Spec.execGraph`'s body
/// is the same term — `execGraph_eq_any` closes by `rfl`. So `authorizedB` is not "the set of
/// reasons the executor says yes"; it *is* capability-graph connectivity, plus reflexivity. That
/// identity is the whole content of `Spec/ExecRefinement.lean`'s `exec_heldcap_is_graph_has` and
/// `exec_authz_grounds_in_graph`, and of `InfoFlow/Confinement.lean`'s `authorizedB_src_forces_reach`
/// → `confined_cannot_debit_attacker`.
///
/// A snapshot is not an edge in that graph. It is a **frozen copy of edges another object held at a
/// past time**, and measured at HEAD it has no live relation to its source: `parent_signature` is
/// `[0u8; 64]` at all three minters, `clist_commitment` is checked only at INSTALL (the refresh
/// forge antibody), `DelegatedRef::is_stale`/`max_staleness` is consulted by NO executor path, and
/// the snapshot's `delegation_epoch` is never compared against the parent's live
/// `CellState::delegation_epoch` at resolution time. Admitting it as a fourth disjunct would make
/// "authorized" ≠ "connected", which does not leave those theorems needing reproof — it makes them
/// **false**: `Confined` is defined by `reachesCell` over `caps`, so a confined actor holding a
/// stale snapshot could debit. It would also break the ← direction of the ~two dozen `iff`-shaped
/// circuit bridges that pin a column to the exact boolean (`Circuit/Transfer.lean:228 tauth_iff`,
/// `Circuit/SetFieldCommit.lean:358 sfauth_iff`, `Circuit/Argus/Stmt.lean:151 transferGuard_iff`,
/// the nine `Argus/Effects/*Guard_iff`, the `Circuit/Spec/*_iff_spec` family), retire
/// `CircuitCompletenessAuthority.authorizedByCap_forces_gate` as a completeness story, and demand a
/// SECOND committed cap tree in the AIR for the opening.
///
/// The kernel already places the snapshot correctly: `delegations` / `delegationEpoch` /
/// `delegationEpochAt` are REGISTRY state, written by spawn/refresh/revoke, read by the state
/// commitment and by `AuthTurn.delegationStale` — which appears in theorem statements and in no
/// `if`-guard anywhere. Revocation's real teeth are `recKRevokeTarget`, which removes the `caps`
/// edge. The model's structural claim is *a snapshot is an attestation, not an authority*, and that
/// is the right claim.
///
/// **So Rust's snapshot authority is OUTSIDE the verified perimeter.** The scope of that caveat
/// today is narrow, and it is THIS FENCE that makes it so — derived, not assumed:
///
///   * a covered root is `target == agent` or bearer (the predicate below);
///   * for `target == agent`, `authorizedB` short-circuits on the ownership disjunct and never
///     reads `caps` at all, so the second store cannot matter;
///   * the cap trio (Grant/Introduce/Attenuate) DO read `caps`, but Rust's `apply_grant_capability`
///     resolves the granter's held edge through `from_cell.capabilities.lookup_by_target`
///     (`turn/src/executor/apply.rs:769`) — the c-list DIRECTLY, not `resolve_authority_at`. Same
///     store on both sides;
///   * the shapes where the snapshot genuinely decides — a cross-cell reach through
///     `check_cross_cell_permission` → `has_access_including_delegation_at` — are fenced out HERE
///     (`ExtractError::AgentReach`), and a cross-cell non-bearer CHILD makes the whole turn
///     unmarshallable (`tree_is_marshallable`);
///   * ⚠ BEARER roots ARE covered, and `verify_bearer_cap` DOES resolve the delegator's held cap
///     through both stores. But that is not a case of the kernel modelling the snapshot narrowly —
///     the kernel does not model `verify_bearer_cap`'s held-cap / non-amplification leg AT ALL. The
///     bearer WHO leg is a `portalVerify` echo on the carried credential, and the body then
///     authorizes through the owner disjunct on `action.target` (see the paragraph above). So the
///     whole `granted ≤ held` check is Rust-side, and the snapshot's role in it is a sub-part of
///     that larger, separately-named residual — not something a `caps` disjunct would fix.
///
/// ⚑ **Therefore no turn in today's covered set would change verdict if `authorizedB` grew a
/// snapshot disjunct.** The gap is real and DORMANT. It wakes the moment the covered set widens to
/// cross-cell non-bearer roots — the cap-reshape lane (#103) — and at that moment deleting this
/// fence is not enough: either a snapshot is separately proved to imply a live `execGraph` edge
/// (which needs the epoch/staleness check at resolution that Rust does not currently perform), or
/// cross-cell reach stays on the Rust producer. Do not read this predicate as only an agent-reach
/// safety net; it is also the reason every `*_authorized` / `*_unauthorized_fails` theorem's scope

///     same-cell child — the executor confers nothing; the child acts on the parent's own cell. THIS
///     is the structural win: a multi-level same-cell delegation tree now crosses as a tree (the
///     gate fires per node, all-or-nothing) instead of a flattened sequential chain.
///   * **bearer-authorized child**: `parentCap = null` ⇒ the subtree runs directly; the bearer WHO
///     leg (its own carried delegation proof, now full-sig faithful) gates it, not a c-list install.
///   * **cross-cell, non-bearer child**: the executor's cross-cell authority model (the
///     `SnapshotRefresh` delegate-chain-walk + frozen snapshot, or the `None`/`ParentsOwn`/`Inherit`
///     fail-closed) does NOT have a verdict-equivalent `recKDelegateAtten` image on this wire (the
///     delegator-holds-cap gate is a DIFFERENT authority predicate than the delegate-pointer
///     chain-walk). Marshalling it as a committable edge could admit what the executor denies (the
///     unsound veto direction), so the turn is INELIGIBLE for the shadow (returns `None`). True
///     cross-cell delegation FIDELITY is the cap-reshape lane's (`#103`); this weld closes the
