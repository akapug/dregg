//! Optional Lean FFI shadow execution — compares Rust commit decisions against the
//! verified Lean kernel without affecting [`dregg_turn::turn::TurnResult`].
//!
//! Enabled when `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1` and `dregg_lean_ffi::lean_available()`.
//!
//! # Scope: full multi-action FORESTS (no longer single-`SetField`)
//!
//! The shadow marshals the WHOLE Rust call-forest through the gated FFI
//! `shadow_exec_full_forest_auth`. A turn's forest is pre-order flattened into a chain
//! of wire actions; the chain is carried as a single root `WForest` whose tail nodes are
//! `null`-cap delegation children — the Lean executor runs `null`-cap children
//! SEQUENTIALLY against the evolving state WITHOUT invoking the cap-handoff gate
//! (`execFullChildrenA`'s `capTarget = none` branch), which is exactly "run these actions
//! in order, all-or-nothing." That faithfully models the Rust executor's pre-order forest
//! walk for the `DelegationMode::None` default (every node acts under its own authority).
//!
//! A turn is shadowed only when EVERY effect maps to a wire action and every referenced
//! cell has a ledger snapshot — anything unmappable makes the turn INELIGIBLE (skipped,
//! never silently mis-encoded; a dropped effect is worse than no shadow at all).
//!
//! The credential WHO-leg crosses faithfully: `Signature`/`Custom`/`Token`/`Bearer`/…
//! carry their FULL 256-bit digests via `marshal::Digest` (not a zeroed low-u64), so the
//! gate is genuinely exercised through the wire.

///     is the structural win: a multi-level same-cell delegation tree now crosses as a tree (the
///     gate fires per node, all-or-nothing) instead of a flattened sequential chain.
///   * **bearer-authorized child**: `parentCap = null` ⇒ the subtree runs directly; the bearer WHO
///     leg (its own carried delegation proof, now full-sig faithful) gates it, not a c-list install.
///   * **cross-cell, non-bearer child**: the executor's cross-cell authority model (the
///     `SnapshotRefresh` delegate-chain-walk + frozen snapshot, or the `None`/`ParentsOwn`/`Inherit`
///     fail-closed) does NOT have a verdict-equivalent `recKDelegateAtten` image on this wire (the

///     chain-walk). Marshalling it as a committable edge could admit what the executor denies (the
