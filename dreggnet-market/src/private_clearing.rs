//! Hiding-proof authorization for the real Dark Bazaar settlement.
//!
//! This module joins the Lean-emitted fixed `N=4,K=4` private-order relation in
//! `dregg-circuit-prove` to the existing [`crate::DarkBazaarSession`]. It does
//! not create a second ledger or a toy settlement: after verification, the
//! normal executor-backed `SETTLE` path closes/reveals the sealed-auction board,
//! folds the conserved award ring, and records its real resolve turn. Existing
//! [`crate::DarkBazaarSession::settle_winning_asset`] then crosses a Descent (or
//! other provenance-carrying) asset through `TradeWorld` to that same winner.
//!
//! The fixed relation is an exact encoding of this crate's one-unit first-price
//! auction for up to three bids: every bid is `(Bid, qty=1, limit=value)` and a
//! synthetic ask is `(Ask, qty=1, limit=highest_bid)`. Therefore its lowest
//! maximum-volume clearing is exactly `(p*, V*) = (highest_bid, 1)`. Values must
//! fit the current four-price family (`0..4`); wider books fail closed.
//!
//! # Honest privacy and source boundary
//!
//! [`DarkBazaarSession::prepare_private_clearing_zk`] builds the witness in this
//! process. `HidingFriPcs` hides it from proof consumers, while this trace-building
//! process still sees every bid: this is Tier-1/operator-visible, not Tier-0
//! no-single-viewer clearing. The public eight-felt root is binding to the proved
//! private book, but the current descriptor does not prove that this Poseidon root
//! opens the auction cell's independent BLAKE3 seals. Production callers must pin
//! [`PrivateClearingExpectation::order_root`] through their authenticated source
//! registry/FHE-MPC transcript. That cross-commitment relation remains explicit,
//! rather than being implied by this API.
