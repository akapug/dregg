//! # DreggNet offering #commerce — a sealed-bid AUCTION / MARKET.
//!
//! The dungeon (offering #0) proved the [`Offering`] abstraction over a *game*; hosted-Hermes
//! over an *agent*; a grain over *compute*; polis over *governance*. This crate proves it reaches
//! an **economic flow** — a market where **value moves**, conservation-checked — by wrapping the
//! real sealed-bid auction substrate as a [`MarketOffering`]:
//!
//!   * **LIST** ([`advance`](Offering::advance) with [`TURN_LIST`]) — a seller opens a listing: a
//!     REAL factory-born auction cell comes alive through the verified executor (a
//!     `CreateCellFromFactory` turn → a genuine [`TurnReceipt`]). The born cell carries the auction
//!     policy FOR LIFE (the `WriteOnce` commit board + the `StrictMonotonic(PHASE)` lifecycle).
//!   * **BID** ([`TURN_BID`]) — a bidder places a **sealed** commit-reveal bid: the [`Bid::seal`]
//!     digest (`BLAKE3(bidder‖value‖nonce)`) lands on the cell's on-ledger `WriteOnce` commit board
//!     as a real verified turn. The teeth are the substrate's, not ours: a **double-bid** (a bidder
//!     overwriting its own committed sealed bid) is a **real executor refusal** (`WriteOnce`); a
//!     **bid after the commit phase closes** is refused by the auction's own phase gate (nothing
//!     submitted — anti-ghost).
//!   * **SETTLE** ([`TURN_SETTLE`]) — the auctioneer closes the commit phase, reveals the bids, and
//!     **clears to the winning sealed bid**. The value moves through the VERIFIED per-asset ring
//!     settlement ([`settle_ring_verified`], the Rust image of the Lean `Ring.settleRing`): the
//!     winner pays its bid of the payment asset to the seller, the slot delivers the good to the
//!     winner, **per-asset Σδ = 0** or the whole award aborts (atomicity + conservation). A
//!     **below-reserve** clear or a **no-valid-bid** auction does **NOT** settle — no value moves,
//!     no resolve turn commits.
//!
//! [`verify`](Offering::verify) re-verifies the cleared chain: re-derive the settlement from the
//! recorded sealed bids and confirm the winner is the real high bid and the value move conserves
//! every asset. [`render`](Offering::render) / [`actions`](Offering::actions) paint the listing +
//! bids as cap-gated deos affordances.
//!
//! ## The substrate wrapped
//!
//! [`starbridge_sealed_auction`] — its in-process [`Auction`] commit/reveal/settle state machine
//! (whose [`Auction::settle`] folds the award ring through the verified executor, conservation-
//! checked) AND its on-ledger auction cell (the factory descriptor + `*_effects` turn builders the
//! executor re-enforces the `WriteOnce` board / `StrictMonotonic(PHASE)` lifecycle on). We consume
//! both altitudes; we re-implement neither sealed bidding nor settlement. See the crate `[HONEST
//! SCOPE]` note at the bottom for what a fuller market (a continuous order book, multi-asset
//! baskets, a live escrow-market clearing organ) adds.
