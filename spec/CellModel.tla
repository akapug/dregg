VARIABLES cells, caps, turns, burned, exercised, nextCapId, mintedCaps

vars == <<cells, caps, turns, burned, exercised, nextCapId, mintedCaps>>

\* Per-cell type predicate.  We don't fix the receipt-payload set in a
\* set type because TLC would need a precise enumeration; the load-bearing
\* structural invariants are ChainSeqWellFormed and ChainWellLinked below.
CellTypeOK(c) ==
    /\ c.pk \in PublicKeys
    /\ c.tid \in TokenIds
    /\ c.nonce \in 0..MaxNonce
    /\ c.perm \in AuthRequired
    /\ c.balance \in 0..MaxBalance

\* Capability ids.  Each cap gets a unique Nat id at mint time (next-cap-id
\* counter, see `nextCapId` below).  Provenance refers to the parent cap by
\* id, not by structural copy — keeping the CapRecord type finite for TLC.
\*
\* MaxCapId is a derived model bound: at most one cap is minted per
\* GrantFromOwn / Redelegate / Introduce step, and `StateBound` caps the
\* set size at `MaxCaps`, so the highest id seen is bounded by that count
\* over the entire trace.  We give a slightly larger envelope to absorb
\* set-bound slack.
MaxCapId == 12

CapIds == 0..MaxCapId

\* Capability parent provenance values.  An "Own" parent records the
\* originating cell whose own perm rooted the cap; a "Delegated" parent
\* records the parent CAP'S ID, so the delegation chain can be walked by
\* the I6 invariant by following ids through `caps`.
ParentOriginValues ==
    { <<"Own", h>>       : h \in CellIds } \cup
    { <<"Delegated", k>> : k \in CapIds }

\* Cap records.  The temporal-soundness invariant I6 reaches back through
\* the `parent` chain by structural pattern match over `caps`.
CapRecord == [

    expiresAt : ExpiryDomain,
    parent    : ParentOriginValues,

]

\* Helper: is `c.parent` an "Own" provenance, or a "Delegated p" provenance?
IsOwnProvenance(c)       == c.parent[1] = "Own"
IsDelegatedProvenance(c) == c.parent[1] = "Delegated"

\* Helper: extract the parent cap id from a "Delegated" provenance.
ParentCapId(c) == c.parent[2]

\* Helper: given a cap id, locate its CapRecord (if any) in the current
\* `caps` set.  We use this for I10 narration of revocation propagation.

\* I1.  Identity integrity.

\* I2.  Nonce well-formedness.

\* I2'.  Nonce monotonicity (action-level).
\* This is a *property* over the next-state relation: the nonce of an
\* existing cell never decreases.  We express it as an action property
\* using the prime operator.
NonceMonotonic ==

\* I3.  Attenuation soundness — state invariant.
\* Every capability in the c-list either was minted from a cell whose own
\* perm attenuates to c.perm (the `GrantFromOwn` source) OR is the
\* attenuation of some other cap to the same target (the `Redelegate`
\* source).  This is the inductive invariant maintained by
\* GrantFromOwn / Redelegate / Revoke.
\*
\* Caveat:  when any cell has perm = "None" (the lattice bottom), the
\* first disjunct is satisfied by every cap (since `None` attenuates to
\* anything).  In that regime the *state* check is weak.  In settings
\* where all cells have strictly restrictive perms (Signature / Proof /
\* Either / Impossible), the state invariant does meaningfully discriminate
\* amplifying caps — see the sanity test in README.md.  The companion
\* action-level property `NoAmplificationProperty` is the strictly

\* I3'. Action-level no-amplification.
\* For every action step, every cap that appears in `caps'` and not in
\* `caps` (i.e., a freshly granted cap) must have been derivable by
\* attenuation from some "source" present in the prior state — either a
\* cell's own perm or an existing cap with the same target.  This is the

\* Action-level: Revoke removes EXACTLY ONE cap and does not touch any
\* other cap, even children of the revoked cap.  This is the policy.
RevokeDoesNotCascade ==
    (caps' # caps /\ Cardinality(caps \ caps') > 0) =>
        \* If anything was removed this step, every removed cap must be a
        \* direct revocation (no cascade to a child whose parent was just
        \* removed).  Concretely: the "removed" set must equal the
        \* "intentionally targeted" set, which we approximate as "no
        \* removed cap has another removed cap as its parent."

MonotonicNonce == [][NonceMonotonic]_vars

\* State constraint: keep the c-list bounded so TLC doesn't explore an
\* unboundedly growing set of caps.  Referenced from CellModel.cfg.
\* We also bound |cells| and the per-cell receipt chain length to keep
\* the search tractable.
\* The bounded perm subset we explore.  AuthRequired has five values
\* (None, Signature, Proof, Either, Impossible); the I1–I5 spec used the
\* full lattice.  For the I6–I10 increment we restrict to the two-element
\* sublattice {Signature, None} (top vs. bottom of the meaningful sub-DAG)
\* to keep state tractable while still exercising I3 attenuation through
\* the cap-mint actions.  The full lattice is still in scope for the
\* fixed cell perms, but cap perm/granted perm choices are constrained.
PermSubset == {"Signature", "None"}

\* The bounded expiry subset.  We pick a single concrete expiry value
\* (0) plus NoExpiry so the model can sample both expired and not-yet-
\* expired caps without exploding state.
ExpirySubset == { NoExpiry, SomeExpiry(0) }

    \* Restrict the dynamic perm / expiry / mask choices so TLC doesn't
    \* explore the full Cartesian product of cap parameters at every
    \* mint step.  The state-space contraction here is purely a TLC
    \* tractability lever — the spec on its own admits the full set.
