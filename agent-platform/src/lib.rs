//! # agent-platform — rent, host, meter, and reap confined agent grains.
//!
//! The agent-side twin of the hosting substrate's webcell platform. A tenant is a
//! [`dregg_agent::session::Session`] — a hosted, cap+budget-bounded, receipted
//! agent, "the unit a hosting layer rents out per user" — opened under
//! [`Confinement::Hosted`] (lexically-confinable tools only; a raw `shell` is
//! refused) over a [`HostedLease`]. [`AgentPlatform::rent`] provisions the grain,
//! [`drive`](AgentPlatform::drive) runs one goal (metered, receipted) and advances
//! the lease's durable checkpoint with a **verified binding** of the session
//! (digest + chain tip + turn count + consumed — read back and re-checked on
//! every [`verify`](AgentPlatform::verify)),
//! [`bill_period`](AgentPlatform::bill_period) meters and settles the rent
//! (in-process or on-chain via the injected [`Settlement`]), and
//! [`reap_if_behind`](AgentPlatform::reap_if_behind) reclaims a delinquent grain.
//! This is the first stone of THE GRAIN (`docs/THE-GRAIN.md`): a hosted agent is
//! a rentable, verifiable grain.
//!
//! ## What a renter can check — the honest R-ladder (`docs/THE-GRAIN.md` face #1)
//!
//! - **R0 (landed, in `dregg-agent`):** the receipt-chain key is a fresh RANDOM
//!   secret, never derived from the public agent id — a third party holding a
//!   report cannot forge a self-consistent chain. The HOST still runs the signer,
//!   so R0 alone is tamper-evidence, not host-independence.
//! - **R1 (landed, here):** rent with a [`RenterAnchor`] and countersign
//!   checkpoints ([`checkpoint_offer`](AgentPlatform::checkpoint_offer) /
//!   [`submit_checkpoint`](AgentPlatform::submit_checkpoint)) — third-party-
//!   verifiable anti-rewrite + anti-truncation relative to a renter-acknowledged
//!   checkpoint, no circuits.
//! - **R2 (the weld is here; the turn is as real as the minter):**
//!   [`drive_minted`](AgentPlatform::drive_minted) welds every admitted action
//!   to a turn committed through the supplied [`GrainTurnMinter`], and
//!   [`verify_r2`](AgentPlatform::verify_r2) rejects any receipt that is not a
//!   view over a committed turn. With `grain-turn`'s real `ToolGatewayMinter`
//!   that is a GENUINE kernel turn and the meter becomes a host-side executor
//!   caveat; `dregg_agent`'s `SyntheticMinter` exercises only the seam (tests).
//! - **R3 (the named gap):** proving the committed turns genuinely RAN is the
//!   whole-history STARK leg — [`grain_verify::WHOLE_HISTORY_GAP`], VK-terminal.

/// The federation / local-submit leg: a minted grain turn lands on a REAL
/// (locally-runnable) node's ledger + finalized receipt log, cross-node-verifiable.
