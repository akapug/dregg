//! # The federation / local-submit leg — a minted grain turn lands on a REAL node.
//!
//! The served path ([`crate::AgentPlatform::drive_serving`]) already mints every
//! admitted agent action as a genuine committed executor turn (the R2 weld). But
//! `grain-turn`'s [`grain_turn::ToolGatewayMinter`] commits those turns to its OWN
//! throwaway in-process `AgentRuntime` — a fresh ledger per drive that no third
//! party can see. So a renter still has to trust *this host* that the turn
//! happened.
//!
//! This module closes that residual: a [`LocalNode`] is a locally-runnable dregg
//! node's two ground-truth surfaces —
//!
//! * its **world-state ledger** (`Arc<Mutex<Ledger>>`, shared INTO the minter, so
//!   the grain turn is executed by a real [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor`] straight onto
//!   the node's ledger), and
//! * its **finalized receipt log** (the node's committed, linked receipt chain a
//!   light client verifies — [`dregg_turn::verify_receipt_chain`]).
//!
//! [`NodeMinter`] is the platform's node-backed [`GrainTurnMinter`]: it mints
//! exactly the same witnessed kernel turn `grain-turn` does (reusing
//! [`grain_turn::action_commit`] + the `CONSUMED`/`HEAP_ROOT`/`ACTION` slot layout,
//! so the committed turn shape is byte-identical and [`crate::AgentPlatform::verify_r2`]
//! still passes) and then **lands** the committed receipt on the node's finalized
//! log through [`LocalNode::land`] — the node's submit-record + finalization gate.
//! `land` REJECTS any receipt that does not link/extend the log (a forged or
//! tampered turn), fail-closed.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — what is REAL vs. the deploy step
//!
//! REAL and exercised here: the minted turn is executed by the genuine kernel
//! executor onto a real node's ledger, recorded on the node's finalized receipt
//! chain, and confirmed landed + light-client-verifiable — cross-node-verifiable
//! (the chain + ledger are exportable ground truth), not "trust this process's
//! private runtime." The default node is IN-PROCESS: a locally-hosted node you can
//! actually use, driven by the same `TurnExecutor` + receipt-chain the node daemon's
//! `POST /turns/submit` handler runs at the library level.
//!
//! The DEPLOY step (operational, NOT done here): pointing the platform at an
//! *external* federation node URL (a homelab node) over HTTP and forwarding the
//! finalized turn to its ingress — see [`crate::AgentPlatform::node_url`]. That leg
//! also carries full multi-node blocklace consensus finalization; the in-process
//! node models the executor + receipt-log half a single node runs locally.
