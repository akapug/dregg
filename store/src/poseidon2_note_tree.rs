//! Persistent Poseidon2 note commitment tree.
//!
//! This wraps `Poseidon2MerkleTree` from `pyana-commit` with redb persistence,
//! providing a ZK-friendly note tree that can generate membership proofs
//! suitable for use inside STARK circuits.
//!
//! The Poseidon2 tree runs alongside the BLAKE3 tree: both store the same
//! logical note commitments, but in different hash domains. The BLAKE3 tree
//! provides fast non-ZK verification, while the Poseidon2 tree provides
//! membership proofs that can be verified inside a STARK proof.
