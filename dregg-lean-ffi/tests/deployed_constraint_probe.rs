//! node's constraint admission is COMPUTED BY THE LEAN SOURCE — not a Rust mirror. Each assertion is
//! a case the deployed `cell/src/program/eval.rs` also decides; the two the audit found DIVERGENT
//! (unsigned-256 fieldGe, first-write-free heap immutable) are pinned here as the reconciled sound
//! semantics.

//! ── THE REALITY-GATE CANARY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! `canary_field_gte_equal` asserts that `fieldGte` on an EQUAL value ADMITS (`>=` is non-strict).
//! To prove the deployed decision goes THROUGH this Lean source: edit
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/DeployedConstraint.lean`, flip `fieldGte`'s `if v ≤ x` to `if v < x`
//! (strict), rebuild (`cargo test -p dregg-lean-ffi --features lean-lib --test
//! deployed_constraint_probe`) — this test FLIPS RED (the equal case now REFUSES). Revert the Lean
//! and it greens. A behavior change in the linked archive caused only by a Lean-source edit is the
//! proof the evaluator is the source, not a parallel copy.
