//! Native linked probe for the Lean-owned Path of Angels Signal genesis ceremony.
//!
//! The fixture is the live epoch-1 tuple frozen from Lean. The probe calls the real linked symbol,
//! compares every returned byte with the frozen Lean output, and then inspects only enough JSON to
//! assert that the embedded config/Canon strings and their digest labels are exact. It does not
//! reconstruct either semantic object or persist a head.
