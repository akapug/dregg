//! # `dreggnet-asset` — the canonical VERIFIABLE ASSET layer.
//!
//! An **asset** is an OWNED, TRANSFER-GATED, PROVENANCE-CHAINED, cross-cell-ADDRESSED
//! primitive — the thing new genres want (a TCG card, an RPG loot drop, an item-market
//! listing, a betting stake). This crate makes it a real dregg construction over the
//! tooth ISA (`cell/src/program/types.rs`) + the real
//! [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor).
//!
//! ## The shape: a note (UTXO) lineage, so authority genuinely MOVES
//!
//! On this substrate a cell's `AuthRequired::Signature` turns must verify against the
//! **cell's own birth pubkey** (`turn/src/executor/authorize.rs`
//! `verify_ed25519_signature`) — so a cell has exactly ONE authorizing key, fixed at
//! birth. Ownership therefore cannot mutate *inside* a single cell; to move authority we
//! move to a **successor** cell owned by the new holder. An asset is thus a **lineage of
//! note versions**, each version a sovereign cell owned by its current holder:
//!
//! ```text
//!   v0 (owner = minter)  ──transfer──▶  v1 (owner = bob)  ──transfer──▶  v2 (owner = carol)
//!    spent := 1                          spent := 1                        (live / holdable)
//!    prev  = 0 (origin)                  prev  = note_digest(v0)           prev = note_digest(v1)
//!    asset_id ─────────────────────── carried unchanged (WriteOnce) ───────────────────────▶
//! ```
//!
//! * **OWNED** — a version cell is owned by the current holder's key. The executor admits
//!   a transfer turn on it IFF the turn's signature verifies under that key. A forged /
//!   non-owner transfer produces an invalid signature → a real executor refusal. THIS is
//!   the ownership gate — cryptographic, not app bookkeeping.
//! * **TRANSFER-GATED** — a transfer is one real committed, owner-signed turn that SPENDS
//!   the current version (sets its `spent` flag `0 → 1`). The version's program (a
//!   `CellProgram::Cases` `transfer` case) gates the spend with `StrictMonotonic(spent)` +
//!   `FieldEquals(spent, 1)` — so the spend lands exactly once and a **double-spend**
//!   (re-spending an already-spent version) is refused (`1 → 1` is not a strict increase).
//! * **PROVENANCE-CHAINED** — every version carries `prev = note_digest(predecessor)`, a
//!   blake3 content address of the predecessor's immutable identity, plus the carried
//!   `minter` and `asset_id`. The lineage is a hash chain any third party recomputes
//!   ([`verify_desc_chain`]); a single tampered version breaks the recomputation. The live
//!   predecessor cells are *also* re-read to confirm each was really `spent` on-chain
//!   (executor-refereed, not just replayed data).
//! * **cross-cell ADDRESSED** — the [`AssetId`] is a stable content address
//!   (`blake3(minter_pubkey ‖ mint_seed)`), carried `WriteOnce` into every successor and
//!   independent of the (changing) cell ids. It is the handle a market / a second game /
//!   a frontend names the asset by.
//!
//! ## How it uses `dregg-schema`
//!
//! The note's slot layout is a [`dregg_schema::Schema`] of `identity` components
//! (asset_id / minter / owner / prev / serial / **trait_root** / **soulbound**) + one
//! field for the mutable `spent` flag, lowered by the **verified allocator**
//! ([`dregg_schema::allocate_checked`]) to a Legal (disjoint + in-bounds, the
//! `RotatedLayout` discipline) register layout. The
//! *transfer-method* dispatch + the `StrictMonotonic(spent)` double-spend tooth fall
//! outside `emit_program`'s fixed genesis+move shape, so the [`CellProgram`] is
//! hand-rolled over the allocator-resolved slot indices (honest partial reuse: the
//! keystone owns the *layout legality*, this crate owns the *transfer semantics*).
//!
//! ## First-class asset properties (beyond the lineage core)
//!
//! * **`trait_root` (E1 closed)** — a first-class committed 32-byte content root every
//!   version carries `WriteOnce`. A visual/stat layer (the sprite / gear crates)
//!   reads it via [`AssetWorld::trait_root_of`] and draws deterministic traits from the
//!   asset's *committed* identity, instead of re-deriving from the raw [`AssetId`] bytes as
//!   a TCB workaround. [`AssetWorld::mint`] populates it with a deterministic derivation of
//!   the id; [`AssetWorld::mint_with_traits`] commits an explicit root (a stat block digest).
//! * **`soulbound` (first-class non-transferability)** — a committed 0/1 flag. The transfer
//!   case gates on `FieldEquals(soulbound, 0)`, so a note minted via
//!   [`AssetWorld::mint_soulbound`] refuses every transfer turn *at the ISA* — the
//!   cryptographic property an earned-credential layer (the cheevo crate) wants, rather
//!   than re-implementing a no-transfer rule one layer up.
//! * **batch mint** — [`AssetWorld::mint_batch`] mints a collection (a pack, a loot table
//!   drop) in one call.
//! * **revocation** — [`AssetWorld::revoke`] lets a minter burn a *mis-minted* asset while
//!   they still hold the untransferred origin, via a real minter-signed spend (no successor).
//!   A non-owner revoke, or a revoke after the asset was handed off, is refused.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — what is real, what is a named seam
//!
//! REAL: the owned + transfer-gated + provenance-chained + content-addressed asset, plus
//! the committed `trait_root` / `soulbound` properties, batch mint and minter revocation —
//! executor-refereed on every gate (owner-signature, double-spend, forged-owner, soulbound
//! non-transfer, non-owner revoke), driven and asserted in `tests/asset_layer.rs`.
//!
//! Each holder runs its own sovereign [`EmbeddedExecutor`] (ledger) — a note lives in its
//! current holder's ledger and the lineage links across them by content address, exactly
//! the sovereign-note model. NAMED SEAMS (not built here):
//! * a **market / exchange** over the asset — `starbridge-apps/escrow-market` is the
//!   trustless trade primitive; an atomic asset↔value swap binds a transfer here to a
//!   sealed-escrow leg there;
//! * **cross-GAME** use — a second game consumes an [`AssetId`] as a foreign holding
//!   (the address is already game-independent);
//! * a **shared federated ledger** — here provenance binds sovereign ledgers
//!   cryptographically; a single federation replicating the versions is the deployment;
//! * the **frontend** (a wallet / inventory view over a holder's live notes);
//! * **expiry / lease semantics** — a committed expiry needs an ambient temporal clock
//!   (a `TemporalGate`-style ISA gate over a context height) that the sovereign-ledger
//!   `AssetWorld` does not yet carry; a first-class expiry field is the next-resolution
//!   step, deliberately not built this pass (it would be a placeholder clock without it).
