//! THE OS-SANDBOX CONFINEMENT — Phase-0 of the cross-platform sandboxed
//! firmament (`.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3`, the ambient-authority half of the
//! v1 isolation upgrade).
//!
//! ## What gap this closes
//!
//! [`crate::process_kernel::ProcessKernel::spawn_pd`] forks a child PD with
//! **MMU isolation** (separate page tables) + a `socketpair(AF_UNIX)` control
//! channel + named `shm` regions + the kernel's epoch-tagged cap-handle
//! [`ValidityTable`]. That is the *memory* half of confinement and it is real.
//! But the fork-path child inherits the parent's **ambient authority**: it can
//! still `open()` arbitrary files, `socket(AF_INET)` the network, `execve` a new
//! image, and it keeps every inherited fd. [`ProcessKernel::ISOLATION_FIDELITY`]
//! names exactly this: "MMU enforces address-space separation" but ambient OS
//! authority is NOT yet confined.
//!
//! This module closes that, applied in the child **right after `fork()`, before
//! the PD `body` runs**, via a per-platform [`confine_child`]:
//!
//! - **macOS (enforced + smoke-tested here):** the child closes every fd except
//!   the granted ones (the control socket), then SELF-applies a `(version 1)
//!   (deny default)` Seatbelt/SBPL profile through `sandbox_init(3)`. The profile
//!   allows only: I/O on already-open fds, the minimal `/usr/lib` + dyld /
//!   framework reads a process needs to keep running, plus any explicitly-granted
//!   read paths. It allows NO `network*`, NO `process-exec*`, NO `mach-lookup*`.
//!   The macOS sandbox MUST be self-applied by the child (a parent cannot impose
//!   it) — fine, the child is trusted firmament code between fork and body.
//!
//! - **Linux (compiled here as a cfg-stub, ENFORCED on Linux):**
//!   `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|NEWNET|NEWNS|NEWPID)` + a uid-map (an empty net
//!   namespace = no route to any network), `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)`, a
//!   default-deny seccomp-bpf allow-list (`seccompiler`), Landlock path-rules
//!   (`landlock`) for any granted read paths, and `close_range` keeping only the
//!   granted fds. On macOS the Linux body compiles to a no-op stub so the crate
//!   builds on both; it only RUNS on Linux.
//!
//! ## The trust statement (don't-launder-vacuity)
//!
//! What this ENFORCES on macOS: a confined child that tries `open("/etc/passwd")`
//! is denied by the Seatbelt profile; `socket(AF_INET)` fails (no `network*`);
//! the inherited control socket is the only fd it holds; the control round-trip
//! still works. What remains TRUSTED: the confinement is the host OS's
//! (Seatbelt / Linux LSMs), the same trust the MMU isolation already places in
//! the host kernel. The child applies it to ITSELF — it is firmament code we
//! wrote, not the (untrusted) PD payload, and it does so before yielding to the
//! payload `body`, so the payload never runs un-confined.
//!
//! Unix-only, behind the `process-pd-sandbox` feature (which implies
//! `process-pd`).

// ───────────────── the provider-egress door — PURE policy layer ──────────────
//
// The Linux provider-only egress door is a seccomp USER-NOTIFICATION filter on
// `connect(2)`: the jailed body may `socket()`, but every `connect()` traps to a
// trusted supervisor (firmament code, outside the jail, in a still-connected net
// namespace) that checks the target `host:port` against the granted `net_out` and
// either establishes the connection ON THE CHILD'S BEHALF (injecting the connected
// fd back) or returns `EPERM`. This is the SOUNDEST of the tractable mechanisms:
//   * deny-default is STRUCTURAL — the child never holds a network route at all
//     (its net namespace stays empty); the ONLY way a byte leaves is a
//     supervisor-mediated, endpoint-checked, pre-established connection. A bug in
//     the plumbing fails CLOSED (a dead supervisor ⇒ `connect` → `ENOSYS`).
//   * it needs NO external binary (unlike slirp4netns) and NO host-network
//     mutation (unlike a veth+nftables NAT), and it precisely matches the existing
//     provider-door test, which points the jail at a HOST loopback listener
//     (`127.0.0.1:port`): the supervisor runs in the host netns, so a granted
//     loopback connect "just works", exactly as macOS Seatbelt filters a shared
//     stack.
//
// This module is the PURE, platform-neutral policy layer (compiled everywhere, so
// it is unit-testable on a macOS dev host): it decides the door MODE from
// `net_out`, parses grants into match targets, builds the connect-filter cBPF
// program, and answers the one fail-OPEN-critical question — "is THIS connect
// target a granted endpoint?". Every other failure in the Linux runtime below
// fails closed, so this admission decision is the load-bearing security kernel and
// is exercised hard by the unit tests.
//
// (On a non-Linux dev host the runtime backend that consumes this is `cfg`-ed
// out, so the builder/consts are used only by the unit tests — allow the dead
// code there rather than scatter per-item attributes.)

//   1. unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|NEWNET|NEWNS|NEWPID) + a uid-map (root-in-namespace
//      maps to the real uid) — an EMPTY net namespace means no route anywhere.
//   2. prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1) — no setuid/fscaps escalation.
//   3. a default-deny seccomp-bpf allow-list (read/write/close/exit/… only) via
//      `seccompiler` — socket()/open()/execve() trap to EPERM/SIGSYS.
//   4. Landlock read rules for any granted read paths via `landlock`.
//   5. (close_all_but already ran in the shared path, keeping the control fd.)
