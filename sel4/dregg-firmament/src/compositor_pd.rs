//! The COMPOSITOR-PD — the minimal framebuffer/input multiplexer (`docs/DREGG-
//! DESKTOP-OS.md §2 L5` + `§6 R3 Stage D`, native-now on the semihost
//! [`EmulatedKernel`]).
//!
//! ## What this is (and is NOT)
//!
//! L5 names "**THE COMPOSITOR-PD (the new minimal multiplexer — the ONLY new
//! TCB)**: the third device-holding organ, SOLE holder of framebuffer/GPU + HID
//! device caps. Models its scene as a verified dregg cell. **NO app logic, NO
//! widget toolkit, NO placement policy.** CPU-composited first." This module is
//! exactly that and nothing more: a deliberately-tiny multiplexer that
//!
//! 1. **SOLELY holds the framebuffer region** — an [`EmulatedKernel`] shm region
//!    ([`EmulatedKernel::create_region`]); on the semihost this is a host
//!    in-memory framebuffer. No app-PD is ever handed this region cap; the only
//!    way a pixel reaches it is through a `present()` the compositor itself
//!    composites after the scene authority admits it.
//! 2. **Models its scene as a dregg cell** — an ordered list of [`Surface`]s,
//!    each `(owner, regions, zLayer, focusFlag, …)`, mirroring the Lean
//!    `Dregg2.Apps.Compositor` `Scene`/`Surface` and the starbridge
//!    `compositor.rs` `CompositorScene`/`CompositedSurface`.
//! 3. **Enforces the verified scene AS THE GATE** on every `present(region,
//!    contentDigest)` an app-PD submits over an Endpoint ([`EmulatedKernel`]
//!    `pp_call`):
//!    - **T1 NON-OVERLAP** — an app composites ONLY its cap-authorized region;
//!      an overpaint of another surface's region is **REFUSED** ([`Refusal::Overpaint`]).
//!    - **T3 FOCUS-EXCLUSIVITY** — input routes ONLY to the focused surface; a
//!      misroute (a non-focused cell asserting focus) is **REFUSED**
//!      ([`Refusal::InputMisroute`]); an ambiguous two-focus scene refuses every
//!      present ([`Refusal::DoubleFocus`]).
//!    - **T2 LABEL-BINDING** — the label is the COMPOSITOR's, a function of the
//!      cell's authority lineage (`owner` + `sourceStateRoot`), read by the
//!      compositor, **never** the app's; a label-spoof is **REFUSED**
//!      ([`Refusal::LabelSpoof`]).
//!
//! ## Fidelity (honestly labeled — NOT laundered, §5 F1/F2/F3)
//!
//! [`CompositorPd::FIDELITY`] states it plainly: the framebuffer is a **host
//! buffer** on the semihost, and the compositor-PD enforces **scene AUTHORITY**,
//! not scanned-out pixels. Binding the scanned-out framebuffer to the cell's
//! `contentDigest` (F1 last-hop frame attestation), IOMMU/DMA confinement of a
//! malicious display PD (F2), and a verified GPU/servo compositor (F3) are the
//! named hardware-trust assumptions — the graphics frontier (R3 Stage C). This
//! module is the CPU-composited software-compositor cell (à la EROS/Nitpicker)
//! where T1–T3 are real; **the pixels are the renderer's, the authority is the
//! compositor's.** We do NOT claim verified graphics.
//!
//! ## Reuse, not reinvention (the WELD method)
//!
//! The scene-authority predicates (`t1_non_overlap` / `t2_label_bound` /
//! `t3_focus_exclusive` / `t3_input_routed` / [`Scene::scene_admit`]) mirror the
//! `Dregg2.Apps.Compositor` Lean `AppSpec` (which PROVES T1∧T2∧T3 as anti-ghost
//! teeth via the production caveat-gated executor) and the gpui-side starbridge
//! `compositor.rs` — same shape, same fail-closed sense, same `labelOf owner
//! root := owner * 1000003 + root`. The IPC + shm + cap substrate is the
//! existing [`EmulatedKernel`] (Endpoint `recv`/`reply`, regions); the rights
//! lattice is the genuine [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] (`granted ⊆ held`),
//! the SAME gate the firmament, the local Mint, and the distributed delegate
//! use. NOTHING here is a parallel model.
