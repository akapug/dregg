//! The microkit facade — the "port" the dregg PDs code against, UML-style.
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3` + L1 (the microkernel seam, "the same-code
//! contract") specifies a **minimal `sel4-microkit`-shaped API** the dregg
//! protection domains (PDs) code against: a `#[protection_domain]`-style entry,
//! a [`Handler`] trait (`notified`/`protected`/`fault`), a [`Channel`]
//! (`notify`/`pp_call`/`irq_ack`), a [`MessageInfo`] + an IPC buffer, and
//! [`memory_region_symbol!`](crate::memory_region_symbol)-style shared memory —
//! cfg-selected **std-backed (semihost, over the [`EmulatedKernel`]) now**, real
//! seL4 later. **A PD's `init()` + `notified`/`protected` bodies are LITERALLY
//! the same text on both** — UML's `um` arch / gVisor platform pattern.
//!
//! This module is the std-backed half. Its public surface mirrors the real
//! `sel4_microkit` crate (`sel4/dregg-pd/*` codes against the genuine one;
//! `~/.cargo/git/.../crates/sel4-microkit/base/src/{channel,handler,message}.rs`
//! is the contract this matches name-for-name):
//!
//! | real `sel4_microkit`        | this facade                          |
//! |-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
//! | `Channel::notify`           | [`Channel::notify`] → kernel Signal  |
//! | `Channel::pp_call`          | [`Channel::pp_call`] → kernel Call    |
//! | `Channel::irq_ack`          | [`Channel::irq_ack`] (no-op host stub)|
//! | `Handler::{notified,protected,fault}` | [`Handler`] (same sigs)    |
//! | `MessageInfo`               | [`MessageInfo`]                       |
//! | `ChannelSet`                | [`ChannelSet`] (badge → channels)     |
//! | `memory_region_symbol!`     | [`Region`] + the macro                |
//! | `#[protection_domain] fn init` | [`ProtectionDomain::spawn`]        |
//!
//! ## How a Channel maps to the kernel (§3: "Channels map to emulated
//! Notification/Endpoint caps")
//!
//! A [`Channel`] is a small index plus a handle to the [`EmulatedKernel`] and
//! the object ids the firmament wired for that channel at boot: a Notification
//! (for `notify`/the `Notified` event) and, if the channel is a protected-
//! procedure channel, an Endpoint (for `pp_call`). The PD names a channel by
//! index exactly as on real Microkit; the facade resolves index → kernel object.
//! The channel index is the *badge bit* the Notification ORs in on `notify`, so
//! the receiving PD's `notified(channels)` recovers WHICH channel fired —
//! matching Microkit's badge-as-channel-set encoding.
