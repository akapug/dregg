//! THE SANDBOXED-FIRMAMENT ACCEPTANCE TEST (Phase 0) — the ambient-authority
//! confinement tooth that `tests/process_isolation.rs` could not enforce.
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3`: the v1 process backing gives a forked PD
//! **MMU** isolation (separate page tables) but the fork-path child still
//! inherits **ambient OS authority** — it can `open` arbitrary files,
//! `socket(AF_INET)` the network, `execve`, and keeps every inherited fd
//! ([`ProcessKernel::ISOLATION_FIDELITY`] names exactly this gap). This file
//! proves that gap is CLOSED by [`ProcessKernel::spawn_pd_confined`], which
//! applies [`dregg_firmament::sandbox::confine_child`] in the child right after
//! `fork()` and BEFORE the body: the child's ONLY channel is the firmament
//! Endpoint (its control socket).
//!
//! The confined child runs FOUR probes and folds the results into its exit code
//! (a bitmask — it cannot use a shm region to report, because confinement closes
//! every non-control fd AND denies `shm_open`; the exit code crosses the process
//! boundary cleanly):
//!
//!   bit 0 (0x1): the control-socket round-trip WORKS (a `Validate` of its
//!                genuine granted handle returns Valid) — IPC over the Endpoint
//!                is unbroken.
//!   bit 1 (0x2): `open("/etc/passwd")` is DENIED (the Seatbelt/LSM profile
//!                refuses arbitrary file reads).
//!   bit 2 (0x4): `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)` FAILS / cannot connect (no
//!                `network*` authority / empty net namespace).
//!   bit 3 (0x8): the inherited control socket is the ONLY non-std fd open (every
//!                other inherited fd was closed by the confinement).
//!
//! All four set ⇒ exit code 0xF. The macOS backend is ENFORCED + run here. The
//! Linux backend compiles (cfg-gated) and runs on Linux.
//!
//! Gated behind `--features process-pd,process-pd-sandbox` (Unix only). Run with:
//!   `cargo test --features process-pd,process-pd-sandbox --test process_sandbox -- --nocapture`
