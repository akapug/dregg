//! THE PROCESS-BACKED BOOT TEST + THE ISOLATION TOOTH (v1, the closed gap).
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3` (the v1 process-backed-PD upgrade): the SAME PD
//! source that boots on the v0 thread backing (`tests/boot_pds.rs`) boots here
//! on the v1 PROCESS backing — PDs are forked host PROCESSES, so the host MMU
//! enforces address-space separation. This file proves TWO things the v0 test
//! could not:
//!
//!   1. **The same-code boot on the process backing** — m0-hello + the 2-PD
//!      notify slice run with PDs as forked processes (not threads). The notify
//!      IPC still works (PD-A `Signal`s, PD-B `Wait`s, via the kernel-mediated
//!      control socket), proving the facade's same-code claim holds across BOTH
//!      backings.
//!   2. **THE ISOLATION TOOTH v0 lacked** — a PD CANNOT read another PD's
//!      private memory (the MMU faults / it sees only its own memory), AND a PD
//!      CANNOT forge a cap by writing raw bytes (the kernel's epoch-tagged
//!      validity table refuses the fabricated handle). Endpoint/Notification IPC
//!      still works; raw cross-PD memory access / cap forgery is REFUSED.
//!
//! Gated behind `--features process-pd` (Unix only). Run with:
//!   `cargo test --features process-pd --test process_isolation -- --nocapture`
//!
//! NOTE on fork-in-a-test: each test forks children that do simple, bounded
//! work and `_exit`. The kernel (the test's parent process) services each
//! child's control socket inline. We keep the work minimal and the children
//! short-lived — exactly the shape a real PD's `init()` has.
