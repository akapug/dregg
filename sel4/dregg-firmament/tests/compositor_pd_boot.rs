//! THE COMPOSITOR-PD BOOT TEST — two app-PDs composite to the framebuffer
//! through the compositor-PD; an overpaint is REFUSED; input routes to the
//! focused one (`.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §2 L5` + `§6 R3 Stage D`).
//!
//! This is the §6 R3 Stage D slice, native-now on the semihost
//! [`EmulatedKernel`]: "Two app-PDs composite to screen, input routes to the
//! focused one (banscii artist's `region_in → composite → region_out → flush`,
//! generalized)." The no-amplification guarantee fires AT THE FRAMEBUFFER.
//!
//! ## The shape (generalizing banscii `region_in → composite → region_out → flush`)
//!
//! The compositor-PD is the Endpoint SERVER. Two app-PDs (a "wallet" and a
//! "browser", the Lean `demoScene` cells) are clients that `pp_call` the
//! compositor's present-endpoint with an encoded `present(region, contentDigest)`
//! (`region_in`); the compositor runs the scene-authority gate, composites the
//! authorized region into the framebuffer it SOLELY holds (`composite` →
//! `region_out`/`flush`), and replies the verdict. We prove, on ONE shared
//! EmulatedKernel:
//!
//!   1. **the wallet's HONEST present COMMITS** — its own region 10 advances; the
//!      framebuffer tile 10 reflects its digest (the COMMIT polarity);
//!   2. **the browser's HONEST present COMMITS** — its own region 20 advances
//!      (two app-PDs composite side-by-side);
//!   3. **the browser's OVERPAINT of the wallet's region 10 is REFUSED** — the T1
//!      tooth fires across the IPC boundary; tile 10 is UNCHANGED (the wallet's
//!      pixel is untouched — no-amplification at the framebuffer);
//!   4. **input routes to the FOCUSED wallet, and the browser stealing it is
//!      REFUSED** — the T3 input gate.
//!
//! ## Fidelity (honestly labeled — NOT laundered)
//!
//! The framebuffer is a HOST in-memory buffer (an EmulatedKernel region), NOT a
//! scanned-out panel — the compositor-PD enforces scene AUTHORITY (T1/T2/T3, the
//! teeth proven in the Lean `Dregg2.Apps.Compositor` AppSpec), and the pixels are
//! the renderer's. F1/F2/F3 (last-hop frame attestation, IOMMU/DMA confinement,
//! verified GPU) are the named graphics frontier (R3 Stage C), NOT solved here.
//! The honest label travels with the code: [`CompositorPd::FIDELITY`].
