# render-pd — the cockpit RE-FLOW spike (lavapipe-in-a-PD)

This directory is the build-spike for the near-term seL4 render path
(`docs/desktop-os-research/SEL4-RENDER-PATH.md` Q2): get the **exact** gpui →
wgpu → lavapipe (software Vulkan) renderer that already bakes the cockpit frame
to run *inside* a seL4 PD, so the cockpit re-flows live per-frame instead of
blitting one baked `cockpit_frame.rgba`.

The renderer never changes — only *where its Vulkan/CPU paint runs* moves from
persvati (the off-VM bake host) into a std-on-seL4-musl PD. The render-PD is the
**executor-rootserver profile** (root-task-with-std + `sel4-musl`), NOT the
`#![no_std]` deos-image PD — lavapipe needs mmap/threads/getenv/W^X-JIT, the
heavy OS surface the executor-PD already proved a seL4 PD can host
(`.docs-history-noclaude/EMBEDDABLE-LEAN-RUNTIME.md`).

## THE GATE — `scripts/build-llvm-elf.sh` then `scripts/build-mesa-lavapipe-elf.sh`

lavapipe JITs shaders through LLVM, so the make-or-break is: **does LLVM + Mesa
cross-link for `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`?** Two stages:

1. `build-llvm-elf.sh` — cross-build a minimal static LLVM 20.1.8 (AArch64 only,
   the gallivm library set: Core/Support/ExecutionEngine/MCJIT/OrcJIT/AArch64
   codegen/...) for aarch64-musl, using the brew `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
   GCC 15.2.0 cross (the executor-PD's toolchain) + a native host `llvm-tblgen`.
   LLVM 20.1.8 is chosen to MATCH the persvati bake (`llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.8)`).
2. `build-mesa-lavapipe-elf.sh` — cross-build Mesa 25.0.7 lavapipe
   (`-Dvulkan-drivers=swrast -Dgallium-drivers=llvmpipe -Dllvm=enabled
   -Dshared-llvm=disabled --prefer-static -Dplatforms=` + glx/egl/gbm/dri3
   disabled), linking the stage-1 static LLVM into `libvulkan_lvp.so`. Headless,
   no DRM/X11/Wayland — mirrors `rerun-io/lavapipe-build` but targeting
   sel4-musl ELF instead of macOS. Build-time codegen (python/mako/bison/flex/
   glslang) runs NATIVE (`native.txt`); the target LLVM is reported by a host
   `llvm-config` shell wrapper over the cross build tree (it can't run the
   target ELF).

**RESULT (2026-06-19): BOTH GATES PASSED.** Gate 1 = 65 static LLVM 20.1.8 libs
for aarch64-musl (the JIT — Orc/MCJIT/ExecutionEngine — included). Gate 2 =
`out/mesa-elf/libvulkan_lvp.so` — a real ELF 64-bit aarch64 software-Vulkan ICD,
83 MB (static LLVM linked in), with `vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr` defined,
lavapipe+llvmpipe+JIT present, and a clean `DT_NEEDED` (no `libLLVM`). The renderer
toolchain builds for the target; the remaining work is the render-PD ELF + the W→X
JIT syscall mapping (`WIRING.md`). Every "wall" hit en route was host-toolchain
plumbing (option names, mako-in-the-right-python, libdrm on the linux target, the
cross `llvm-config --libs` contract, archive grouping, a host `CPPFLAGS` LLVM-22
header leak, the `llvm-c` source-header path) — NONE was a musl/seL4 capability wall.
Full measured outcome: `docs/desktop-os-research/SEL4-RENDER-PATH.md` §"THE SPIKE
RESULT".

## The render-PD wiring (after the gate) — BUILT + BOOTED; lavapipe RUNS in-VM

A std-on-musl root-task PD (clone of `dregg-pd/executor-rootserver`) that links the
lavapipe ICD statically (the PD target has no dynamic loader, so the same Mesa +
LLVM 20.1.8 inputs the gate's `.so` was built from are relinked into the root-task
ELF — `build.rs`) + a C render driver, with the sel4-musl syscall handler extended
for lavapipe's runtime surface. **`make build && make image && make run` boots it
headless and lavapipe runs inside the seL4 PD:**

```
[driver] vkCreateInstance OK — lavapipe VkInstance live in the PD
[driver] VkPhysicalDevice[0] = "llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.8, 128 bits)" (apiVersion 1.4.305)
[driver] STAGE 3: vkCreateDevice = -13 (VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN)
```

- **The genuine new OS demand — the JIT's W→X executable mapping — is implemented**
  (`src/main.rs`): a static RWX `JIT_ARENA` (executable because the
  `aarch64-sel4-roottask-musl` target links `--no-rosegment`, so the kernel maps the
  whole root-task image with execute permission) backs every `mmap(PROT_EXEC)`; the
  `mprotect(→PROT_EXEC)` flip is a faithful no-op (the page is already X). No new
  seL4 capability needed.
- **The wall is one rung deeper: `thrd_create`.** lavapipe's Vulkan device
  unconditionally spawns a submit thread (`vk_queue_enable_submit_thread`, not gated
  by `LP_NUM_THREADS`); the seL4 musl `pthread_create`→`__clone` returns `-ENOSYS`
  in a single-thread root task → `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN`. The JIT W→X path is wired and
  ready but lies one stage past device creation (lavapipe JITs lazily at pipeline
  build). The NEXT OS demand = a real seL4 TCB for `__clone` (the executor-PD-class
  follow-on). Full measured detail + the lever: `WIRING.md`.

Once `__clone` is serviced: `vkCreateDevice` succeeds → a pipeline JITs (the first
W→X flip) → the gpui `render_scene_to_image` Scene → RGBA → `src/render_blit.rs`
(the staged RGBA→XRGB8888→ramfb blit, the deos-image loop minus the bake) → the
byte-compare against `cockpit_frame.rgba` proves parity.
