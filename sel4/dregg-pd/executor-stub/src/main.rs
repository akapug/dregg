//! The executor-PD SEAT in the 5-PD firmament assembly (`sel4/dregg.system`).
//!
//! This is a minimal placeholder PD holding the firmament HEART seat until the
//! verified Lean executor (`execFullForestG`, `metatheory/`) can cross-compile
//! for `aarch64-sel4-microkit` (THE blocker — the Lean-runtime bottom-half ELF
//! recompile + libuv excision + musl host, docs/SEL4-EMBEDDING.md §2 /
//! docs/FIRMAMENT.md §6). It does NOT run verified compute; the verifier-stark
//! PD is the bankable verified-compute heart organ in this assembly.
//!
//! What it DOES do, faithfully, is occupy the executor's exact place in the cap
//! partition (docs/FIRMAMENT.md §2): it maps the `turn_in` (R) and `commit_out`
//! (RW) shared regions the real executor will use — and NOTHING else (no device
//! cap, no NIC cap) — touches them to prove the caps are live, and prints the
//! partition over serial. The assembly therefore BOOTS as a real multi-PD image
//! with the executor seat held + wired.
