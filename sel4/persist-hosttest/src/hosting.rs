//! `hosting` — the app-hosting economy: **pay coin to be hosted is a VERIFIED
//! VALUE TURN**, and a fee that lapses EVICTS the app (a verified turn that drops
//! the durable hosting). The deos OS charges coin to host apps; this is that
//! charge, modeled as conserving value turns committed through the persist-PD
//! durable spine — fail-closed, conserving, every charge and eviction a row in the
//! durable commit log.
//!
//! # The thesis
//!
//! deos hosts apps. An app is a **cell with durable hosted state in the persist-PD**
//! (its rows live in the same `dregg.turns` commit log as everything else — the
//! deos spine, `.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG-ON-SEL4-DEOS-SPINE.md`). Hosting is not free: per
//! hosting period the app **pays a fee in coin to the host cell**. That payment is
//! a real value move — a [`turn`-crate `Effect::Transfer { from, to, amount }`]
//! (conservative linearity, `turn/src/action.rs:819`): coin LEAVES the app cell and
//! ARRIVES at the host cell, Σ value unchanged. It is committed as a verified turn
//! through the durable store (the chain gate admits it; the log records it), so the
//! charge is durable, ordered, and self-checking like every other turn.
//!
//! When the fee LAPSES — the app cannot pay the period's fee (insufficient balance)
//! — the host EVICTS it: a verified turn that drops the app's durable hosting (its
//! lease ends, its slot is reclaimed). Eviction is itself a committed turn, so it
//! is fail-closed (the app does not get to keep its hosting by refusing to pay) and
//! auditable (the eviction is a durable row). A PAID app's hosting persists.
//!
//! # The lease — a cap with a time/budget caveat over the durable slot
//!
//! A [`HostingLease`] is exactly what the brief names: a capability to occupy a
//! durable hosting slot, bounded by a budget (the prepaid balance) and a time
//! window (the paid-through period). The Lean model (`Dregg2/Apps/HostingLease.lean`)
//! proves the lease's gate cannot be amplified and the eviction is forced when the
//! budget lapses; THIS module is the runnable realization wired through the durable
//! commit log. The two meet at the same discipline: a hosting period either pays
//! (a conserving transfer commits, the lease's paid-through advances) or it does not
//! (the lease cannot cover the period → eviction commits).
//!
//! # Conservation — the load-bearing economic property
//!
//! Every hosting charge is a `Transfer`: the app's balance falls by `fee`, the
//! host's rises by `fee`, and [`HostingEconomy::total_value`] (Σ over all cells) is
//! INVARIANT across every charge. A charge that did not conserve (minted coin into
//! the host without debiting the app, or burned the app's coin without crediting
//! the host) would be refused — value cannot be forged through hosting. The teeth
//! (`§ tests`) prove: a charge conserves; an under-funded app is evicted; a paid
//! app persists; eviction is a durable, ordered turn; and value is conserved
//! end-to-end across a multi-period, multi-app run.
