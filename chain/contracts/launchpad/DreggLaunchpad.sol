/// @title DreggLaunchpad
/// @notice The provably-fair token launchpad — the EVM realization of the four
///         verified turns in `docs/deos/DREGG-LAUNCHPAD-DESIGN.md` §2, deployable
///         to Robinhood Chain (Arbitrum-Orbit L2, chainId 46630). A launch is:
///
///   (a) REGISTRATION with a DISCLOSED supply/vesting schedule, committed
///       on-chain and publicly checkable — NO HIDDEN SUPPLY (§2.1). The token is
///       a `DreggLaunchToken`: hard-capped, minted exactly once for the whole
///       disclosed supply, no second mint door.
///   (b) a SEALED-BID batch raise: bidders commit `H(price‖qty‖salt‖bidder)`
///       during the commit window, then reveal (§2.2, `SealedAuction`). No bid is
///       observable before clearing, and a reveal that does not open its
///       commitment is rejected — NO SNIPE / NO LATE-SWITCH.
///   (c) UNIFORM-PRICE clearing: the whole revealed book clears at ONE price,
///       computed on-chain by a permutation-checked descending sort (no-drop /
///       no-insert, `Market/Aggregation.lean`) + a marginal-fill walk. Every
///       winner pays the SAME price — the mechanism whose fairness is PROVED in
///       `Market/Optimality.lean` (`uniform_price_no_arbitrage`,
///       `uniform_price_envy_free`). An optional `IClearingAttestor` binds a real
///       dregg Groth16 clearing proof (the PROVED rung; the named weld).
///   (d) NON-CUSTODIAL settlement: each winner pays the clearing price, receives
///       tokens, and is refunded the rest of its deposit; the creator withdraws
///       proceeds; the creator allocation is VESTING-LOCKED until the disclosed
///       cliff — the dev-dump guard (§3, vector A).
///   (e) GRADUATION into a PROVABLY-SOLVENT liquid market (§2.3): once the raise
///       has cleared and settled, the token graduates into a `DreggSolventPool` —
///       the DrEX rung-6 never-insolvent pool (`Market/Liquidity.lean`). The pool
///       is seeded with a DISCLOSED fraction (`graduationBps`) of the canonical
///       raise proceeds (the quote reserve) + the disclosed `poolAllocation` (the
///       token reserve). The seeding is deterministic + on-chain-verifiable
///       (`graduationSeed`); a wrong/hidden seeding reverts (`GraduationSeedMismatch`).
///       Post-graduation the token trades on the pool, which CANNOT be drained
///       below its floor (`DreggSolventPool.PoolFloorBreached`) — the fair
///       post-launch market a pump.fun bonding curve cannot offer.
///
/// ## Trust grades (honest, per `DREGG-LAUNCHPAD-DESIGN.md` §0 spine)
/// - supply disclosure + one-shot mint: BUILT/on-chain-enforced (no hidden door).
/// - sealed commit→reveal (no peek / no late-switch): BUILT/on-chain-enforced.
/// - uniform-price clearing fairness: the MECHANISM is PROVED in Lean; the
///   on-chain computation is a faithful REPLAYABLE implementation; a real
///   dregg-Groth16 clearing attestation is the named weld (rung 2).
/// - creator vesting lock (dev-dump guard): BUILT/on-chain-enforced.
/// - full bonded-conduct slashing / shielded participation: designed-not-built
///   (§4, §5) — NOT in this MVP.
