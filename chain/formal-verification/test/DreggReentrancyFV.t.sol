/// @title REENTRANCY-FREEDOM — SYMBOLIC formal verification (Halmos)
/// @notice A NEW anti-rug invariant, PROVEN not grepped: a state-changing function
///         that makes an external call is CHECKS-EFFECTS-INTERACTIONS correct, so a
///         re-entrant caller cannot drain funds it is not owed. This is the machine
///         proof of the reentrancy class that Stage-A grep never covered (it is a
///         Stage-C code-review class, `DREGG-AUDIT-SERVICE.md §C`) — turned into a
///         symbolic proof over the real compiled bytecode.
///
/// THE INVARIANT (INV-REENTRANCY): a contract that holds funds on behalf of many
/// parties never lets one party's external call (and its re-entrant callback)
/// reduce the funds owed to OTHERS. The classic reentrancy drain (DAO / CEI
/// violation: `send` BEFORE the balance write) lets a re-entrant attacker withdraw
/// its balance twice, stealing others' deposits. A CEI-correct contract (the effect
/// lands BEFORE the interaction) has no such door: the re-entrant read sees the
/// already-applied effect, so the second withdraw is refused.
///
/// TWO POLARITIES (mirrors DreggNoDrainFV):
///   * SAFE   — `SafeVault` (effect-before-interaction) and the REAL
///     `DreggSolventPool.sell` (reserves updated BEFORE `_sendEth`, pool source
///     lines 155-166) are PROVEN reentrancy-safe: a re-entrant caller cannot take
///     other holders' ETH / cannot push a reserve below its disclosed floor.
///   * UNSAFE — `ReentrantVault` (interaction-before-effect, the CEI VIOLATION)
///     admits a re-entrant-drain COUNTEREXAMPLE: an attacker deposits D, re-enters,
///     and extracts 2·D, stealing D from other depositors. Grep for `.call{value:}`
///     finds the external call; THIS proves whether the ordering is exploitable.
///
/// WHY HALMOS: identical to the sibling specs — the pool's guards use custom errors
/// (`PoolFloorBreached`) which solc CHC models as fall-through; Halmos runs the
/// bytecode. See README §1.
///
/// BOUND: reentrancy FV is symbolic-BOUNDED in re-entry DEPTH — the inline attacker
/// re-enters a bounded number of times (here: once, `reentries < 1`), so Halmos
/// proves "no drain up to that re-entry depth", not the unbounded ∀-depth statement.
