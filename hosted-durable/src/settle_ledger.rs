//! `settle_ledger` — a **durable**, restart-surviving record of settled
//! `(lease, period)` keys, so a production settlement rail (e.g.
//! [`crate::payable::PayableSettlement`] over a node-API submitter) is
//! exactly-once across a process restart (or a second settler instance sharing
//! the path), not merely exactly-once in-memory.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (red-team LEASE-3, ported from the operated layer)
//!
//! [`crate::payable::PayableSettlement`]'s dedup is an in-memory
//! `Mutex<HashMap<(lease,period), …>>` — its own doc names cross-restart
//! exactly-once as "the submitter side's concern (the node-API rail's durable
//! write-ahead ledger)". THIS is that ledger, ported from the operated layer
//! (`the prior operated layer control/src/settle_ledger.rs`) where the property was red-teamed:
//! a settler restart (a crash, a redeploy, a second instance) starts with an
//! EMPTY map, so it re-settles every `(lease, period)` it is handed again —
//! each as a fresh **real on-chain `Transfer`**, double-charging the lessee.
//!
//! This ledger closes that: it persists each settled key to disk and is
//! consulted **before** a transfer is submitted. A reservation is written
//! **write-ahead** (before the on-chain submit), so the property the rail
//! upholds is **at-most-once on-chain submission per `(lease, period)` across
//! any number of restarts**:
//!
//! - a key already present (this process OR a prior process's persisted file)
//!   is **replayed** — no second transfer is submitted;
//! - a fresh key is persisted+fsync'd before the submit, so a crash anywhere
//!   after the reservation leaves the key marked and a restart will NOT
//!   resubmit.
//!
//! The safe direction is deliberate: a settlement that crashed between the
//! write-ahead reservation and the on-chain commit is treated as
//! already-settled (it may be an operator-reconciliation item — under-charge,
//! never double-charge). The strongest cross-live-instance form is a database
//! unique constraint on `(lease, period)`; this file-backed ledger is the
//! dependency-light form that makes a **restart** provably non-double-charging.
//! (The kernel-native endgame is stronger still: a settlement as a turn whose
//! exactly-once is the nullifier discipline — this ledger is the honest rail
//! until settlements ride turns end-to-end.)
//!
//! ## Format
//!
//! Append-only JSON lines, one [`SettleRecord`] per line. A reservation appends
//! a record with `turn_hash: null`; a confirmation appends the same key with
//! the on-chain turn hash + post-transfer balances. On load, the **last**
//! record for a key wins, so a confirmed record supersedes its reservation.
//!
//! ## Wiring (applied)
//!
//! `pub mod settle_ledger;` is in `hosted-durable/src/lib.rs`, `serde_json` is a
//! crate dependency, and the submitter side consults it through
//! [`crate::durable_settlement::DurableSettlement`] (reserve_or_replay → submit
//! → confirm around its injected [`crate::payable::PaySubmitter`]).
