//! # `Payable` — the dregg standard interface for cross-app VALUE FLOW.
//!
//! `Payable` is a tiny, ocap-shaped, **conservation-respecting** standard for
//! "this cell can be paid / can pay", ERC-20-shaped but built on the kernel's
//! per-asset Σδ=0 value layer instead of a balance map an owner can mutate at
//! will:
//!
//! ```text
//!   pay(asset, amount, to)   — move `amount` of `asset` from THIS cell to `to`.
//!   balance(asset)           — read THIS cell's holding of `asset`.
//! ```
//!
//! ## It desugars to a REAL kernel `Effect::Transfer` — through the DFA router
//!
//! A `Payable` is NOT a new kernel effect and NOT a new commitment field. It is a
//! userspace [`InterfaceDescriptor`]. `pay` routes through the verified DFA router
//! ([`crate::routing::resolve_against`]) and desugars to the ONE effect the kernel
//! already conserves: an [`Effect::Transfer`] moving the asset between two cells
//! of one `World`/ledger. Because `Transfer` is `LinearityClass::Conservative`
//! (per-asset Σδ=0), a payment in one app becomes a balance another app's cell
//! can spend — and the kernel conservation check holds ACROSS the app boundary.
//!
//! ## One source of truth, two callers
//!
//! [`resolve_pay`] is the verified desugar. The app framework's signed-turn `pay`
//! (the apps' `bounty.pay(reward, escrow)`) goes through it, AND the SDK's metered
//! tool-gateway charge goes through it — the SAME route table, the SAME `Signature`
//! cap gate, the SAME conserving `Transfer`, not a parallel hand-rolled effect.
