//! The dregg **http-bridge shim** — run an `.spk` grain as a served workload.
//!
//! The key fact the integration turns on (plan §1.5): the vast majority of catalog
//! apps are *not* native Cap'n Proto — they are an ordinary HTTP server on
//! `localhost:8000` inside the chroot, fronted by `sandstorm-http-bridge`. The bridge
//! owns the grain's single outside socket, implements the `WebSession` capnp
//! interface, and proxies HTTP-over-RPC to that local server — injecting the
//! identity/permission headers (`X-Sandstorm-User-Id`, `-Username`, `-Permissions`,
//! `-Session-Id`) the app reads to know who is calling and what they may do.
//!
//! The dregg shim is that bridge, with the permission headers **derived from the
//! holder's dregg cap**: the facets of the cap a session presents *become* the
//! `X-Sandstorm-Permissions` value. So the app's permission model is enforced by the
//! cap lattice (and is witnessed), not by an ambient identity the host asserts.
//!
//! This module is the `WebSession`→HTTP surface + the cap→headers derivation + the
//! grain `/var` ↔ cell umem wiring, exercised in-process. A real grain runs the
//! `.spk` chroot in a `Caged`/`MicroVm` tier; here a [`GrainWorkload`] stands in for
//! the app's `:8000` server so the shim contract (verbs, headers, persistence) is
//! exercised without executing untrusted code. The contract is exactly what a real
//! workload sees.
//!
//! A session's capability is a real `dregg-auth` `dga1_` credential; its
//! permission set is derived on the rail via [`crate::webauth_rail::derive_permissions`].
