//! The grain's private data = a dregg cell's **umem heap**.
//!
//! In Sandstorm a grain's `/var` is a read-write bind-mount, private to that grain,
//! that the app stores its database/state in. On dregg that `/var` *is* the cell's
//! umem heap: a keyed byte store that commits to a content-addressed **`data_root`**.
//! The difference Sandstorm cannot offer: the root is a commitment, so a checkpoint
//! is re-witnessable (a backup that proves what it contains), and the transitions —
//! not just a snapshot — are what get committed.
//!
//! ## The commitment is the REAL dregg heap-root scheme (not an ad-hoc sha256 tree)
//!
//! This module commits a grain's `/var` through the **same** openable sorted-Poseidon2
//! binary Merkle tree the kernel commits a cell's heap with:
//! [`dregg_circuit::heap_root`] (`CanonicalHeapTree` / `compute_heap_root`, the exact
//! primitive `dregg_cell::compute_heap_root` wraps). Each `/var` entry `(key, value)`
//! becomes a [`dregg_circuit::heap_root::HeapLeaf`] `{ addr, value }`:
//!
//! * `addr = var_addr(key)` — a Poseidon2 felt over the domain-tagged key bytes (the
//!   real heap keys `(collection_id, key)` u32 pairs via `heap_addr`; a grain's `/var`
//!   keys are strings, so its sort key is the Poseidon2 image of the key — the same
//!   sorted-tree sort key, the same `CanonicalHeapTree`, same sentinels, same depth);
//! * `value = var_value_felt(value)` — a Poseidon2 felt digest of the value bytes
//!   (the real heap folds a 32-byte `FieldElement`; a grain value is arbitrary-length,
//!   so its committed value is the Poseidon2 digest, binding under Poseidon2 CR).
//!
//! So `Umem::commit_root_bytes()` == `dregg_circuit::heap_root::compute_heap_root` of
//! the grain's leaves, encoded to 32 bytes exactly as `dregg_cell` encodes a heap-root
//! felt (`babybear_to_bytes32` / `felt_to_bytes32`). This is the value a real
//! deployment's ledger carries for a cell's heap — NOT a bespoke sha256 root the
//! federation never stores. A single entry's inclusion under the root is provable
//! *without the rest of the heap*: [`Umem::prove`] emits an [`InclusionProof`] (the
//! `CanonicalHeapTree` sibling path, a Poseidon2/felt path), and the host-state-free
//! [`verify_inclusion`] checks `{key, value, proof, root}` alone — a visitor re-hashes
//! just the served card and confirms it is the value at `key` under a heap-root it
//! obtains independently.
