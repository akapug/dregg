//! # Service-promise exchange — the spine of the agent service economy.
//!
//! The ring ([`crate::ring_trade::RingCoordinator`]) and the [`crate::payable`]
//! DSI exchange ASSETS atomically: a party offers an asset, wants an asset, the
//! verified [`RingSolver`] matches a conserving cycle and the legs settle
//! all-or-nothing. That is a *spot* market — value-for-value, both sides on the
//! table at once.
//!
//! A service economy needs more: a provider promises to PERFORM a service later,
//! and a consumer pays for it now. The danger is the half-open deal — the
//! consumer pays and the provider never performs, or the provider performs and
//! the consumer never pays. This module closes that gap with the SAME pieces the
//! ring already trusts, composed into a service-for-payment leg:
//!
//!  1. **Match** — a provider posts a [`ServicePromise`] ("I will perform service
//!     `S` for `price`"); a consumer posts a [`ServiceRequest`] ("I want `S`,
//!     offering `P`"). The match is found by the SAME [`RingSolver`] the asset
//!     ring uses: the service is encoded as a synthetic "promise-token" asset, so
//!     a provider↔consumer pair is exactly a 2-cycle (provider offers the
//!     promise-token + wants payment; consumer offers payment + wants the
//!     promise-token). [`ServicePromiseExchange::match_one`].
//!
//!  2. **Escrow** — the matched payment leg is not paid straight to the provider;
//!     it is HELD. The payment moves consumer → escrow through the verified
//!     executor ([`settle_ring_verified`], per-asset Σδ=0), exactly the
//!     conserving move the ring already proves. [`ServicePromiseExchange::fund`].
//!
//!  3. **Fulfill** — the promise is a guarded hole. The provider commits, at
//!     match time, to performing a specific verified turn (the service effect) — its
//!     hash AND the state-commitment transition (`expected_pre/post_commitment`) it
//!     moves through. The held payment is bound by a [`ProofCondition::TurnProven`]
//!     naming that hash + those endpoints — the exact promise-hole shape
//!     `turn/src/{eventual,conditional}.rs` defines (a one-shot continuation whose
//!     fill is a VERIFIED proof the service turn executed). When the provider performs
//!     the turn the commit pipeline produces a [`ProvenReceipt`] (the verified rotated
//!     EffectVM STARK); presenting its [`ConditionProof::EffectVmProof`] FILLS the hole
//!     ([`resolve_condition`] → `Resolved`) and the escrow RELEASES the payment escrow
//!     → provider, through the verified executor. [`ServicePromiseExchange::fulfill`].
//!
//!  4. **Refund** — if the promise lapses (the timeout passes with no conforming
//!     receipt) the held payment REFUNDS escrow → consumer.
//!     [`ServicePromiseExchange::refund`].
//!
//! Every value move is a single-leg [`settle_ring_verified`] fold, so each is
//! atomic and per-asset conserving on its own, and the whole lifecycle conserves
//! the payment asset end-to-end (consumer's `price` ends up wholly with the
//! provider on fulfillment, or wholly back with the consumer on refund — never
//! split). Release and refund are mutually-exclusive one-shot terminals, the same
//! consumed-once discipline `cell/src/escrow_sealed.rs` binds into a cell's
//! commitment; here the holder is the verified ledger rather than a heap leaf, but
//! the invariant is identical: a held leg is taken exactly once, by exactly one of
//! its two exits.
//!
//! ## What a "service" is, and how fulfillment is proven
//!
//! A [`ServiceId`] names a service as a `(target cell, method)` pair — a method/
//! effect the provider will exercise on a target. The provider's commitment to
//! perform it is the `service_turn_hash` it posts: the content-addressed
//! [`dregg_turn::Turn::hash`] of the exact verified turn that performs the
//! service. Fulfillment is proven the way the kernel proves "a turn ran" AFTER the
//! trusted-key retirement (assurance-perimeter #3): a VERIFIED rotated EffectVM STARK
//! ([`ConditionProof::EffectVmProof`]) whose bound turn hash matches the promise AND
//! whose wide state-commitment anchors equal the promised `expected_pre/post_commitment`
//! (the [`ProofCondition::TurnProven`] resolution path). No executor SIGNATURE is
//! consulted — the trust root is the PROOF. HONEST SCOPE: the proof attests the
//! state-commitment DELTA `pre -> post`, not the full state, and rests on the FRI floor
//! (`project-fri-soundness-reality`). This module does NOT decide what counts as the
//! service being "done well" — it binds payment to a PROVEN state transition. Richer
//! fulfillment (a STARK proof of an outcome predicate) is the
//! `ProofCondition::LocalProof` / `RemoteProof` path, pluggable through the same
//! [`ServiceEscrow::condition`] field.
