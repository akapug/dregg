//! `DeosApp` — **the deos-app composition**: the six layers wired into ONE shape.
//!
//! `docs/deos/DEOS-APPS.md` (§"the deos app model"): a **deos app** is a set of
//! **cells** exposing **affordances** (cap-gated verified-turn templates) → rendered
//! as **web surfaces** → over **durable verified state** → reached by **agents**
//! (human or AI) through the **SDKs** → distributed across the **web-of-cells**
//! (federated, sturdyref-linked) → **rehydratable** (frustum-snapshots). The gap the
//! doc names (§6): "the pg-dregg / sdk / web-surface stack is uncomposed … three good
//! pieces that *do not yet compose* into the deos app stack." `DeosApp` IS that
//! composition.
//!
//! The framework already had the bones SEPARATELY — [`AffordanceSurface`] + the
//! [`crate::affordance_endpoint`] HTTP surface, the [`StarbridgeAppContext`]
//! registration, the [`AppCipherclerk`] + [`EmbeddedExecutor`] SDK surface, the
//! [`CapTpServer`] + [`NameserviceClient`] web-of-cells distribution, and the
//! [`crate::rehydration`] frustum-snapshots. `DeosApp` composes them into **ONE
//! registration** so an app builder writes *affordances + a surface* and the
//! framework wires the verified state, the SDK surface, the distribution, and the
//! rehydration — `register(ctx)` becomes `DeosApp::builder(...).cell(...).build()`,
//! and ONE `mount()` yields the whole axum surface.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let app = DeosApp::builder("doc-app", cipherclerk, executor)
//!     .federation(FederationId([0xAB; 32]))
//!     // one cell exposing its affordances; published into the web-of-cells:
//!     .cell(DeosCell::new(doc, "doc")
//!         .affordance(CellAffordance::new("view",  AuthRequired::Signature, view_fx))
//!         .affordance(CellAffordance::new("edit",  AuthRequired::Either,    edit_fx))
//!         .affordance(CellAffordance::new("admin", AuthRequired::None,      admin_fx))
//!         .publish(AuthRequired::Signature)) // exported as a sturdyref at this authority
//!     .discoverable(vec!["docs".into()])     // auto-registers in the nameservice
//!     .build();
//!
//! // ONE registration onto the shared host context (alongside other deos apps):
//! app.register(&ctx);
//!
//! // ONE mount yields the whole HTTP surface (per-cell affordance routers + the
//! // app manifest + the web-of-cells snapshot endpoints):
//! let router = app.mount();
//! ```
//!
//! ## What each layer becomes
//!
//! - **cells × affordances** → [`DeosCell`] bundles a backing cell with its
//!   [`AffordanceSurface`]; [`DeosApp`] holds many.
//! - **the SDK surface** → the app carries the [`AppCipherclerk`] + [`EmbeddedExecutor`]
//!   every fire routes through (the verified-turn dispatch seam, already closed).
//! - **web-of-cells distribution** → a published cell is exported through the
//!   [`CapTpServer`] as a `dregg://` sturdyref ([`DeosApp::publish_all`]) AND
//!   registered in the nameservice ([`DeosApp::announce`]).
//! - **rehydratable** → [`DeosCell::snapshot`] mints a [`crate::rehydration::Sturdyref`]
//!   a peer rehydrates per-viewer through a [`crate::rehydration::Membrane`] — the
//!   frustum-snapshot, composed with the cell's live affordance surface.
//! - **durable verified state** → a DOCUMENTED SEAM ([`PersistenceSeam`]): the
//!   pg-dregg layer (reads are free SQL, writes are verified turns) plugs in here.
//!   Marked honestly, NOT faked — the embedded executor is the in-process state today.

// `Arc` is used only by the server-only shared held-rights `resolver` (field + builder
// + `mount`), so it rides the same gate — the wasm-clean core needs no `Arc`.
