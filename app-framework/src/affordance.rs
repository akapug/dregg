//! Cell affordances — **htmx on crack**, brought into the framework's own bones.
//!
//! `docs/deos/DEOS-APPS.md` (§"the deos app model") is the evolution plan: a
//! **deos app** is a set of **cells** exposing **affordances** (cap-gated
//! verified-turn templates) rendered as **web surfaces**. The standalone
//! `starbridge-web-surface` crate prototyped the *shape* (`affordance.rs`); this
//! module brings that shape INTO `dregg-app-framework`, built on the framework's
//! REAL primitives, and **closes the dispatch seam the standalone left open**:
//!
//! - The gate is the GENUINE [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] (`required ⊆ held`) —
//!   NOT a new gate, NOT a parallel role check, the SAME predicate the firmament
//!   runs for every capability.
//! - The effect-template is a real [`dregg_turn::Effect`] — the genuine turn the
//!   executor runs (a `SetField` for an edit, an `EmitEvent` for a comment, a
//!   `GrantCapability` for an admin grant).
//! - **Firing runs a REAL verified turn through the framework's
//!   [`EmbeddedExecutor`].** The standalone produced an `AffordanceIntent` and
//!   stopped (its named seam: "handing the intent to a live `TurnExecutor`"). HERE
//!   that seam is closed: [`AffordanceSurface::fire_through_executor`] hands the
//!   gated effect to [`EmbeddedExecutor::submit_turn`] and returns the executor's
//!   OWN [`dregg_turn::TurnReceipt`], chained on the per-agent receipt chain.
//!
//! ## The interaction model
//!
//! In htmx an element declares `hx-post="/x"` and the server returns a fragment.
//! In deos a **cell declares affordances** — named effect-templates — and an
//! interaction is a **verified turn**: the "button" is a cap-gated
//! [`dregg_turn::Effect`], and *who may press it* is decided by **held
//! capabilities** ([`AuthRequired`]), not a session cookie. Progressive
//! enhancement becomes progressive **attenuation**: an agent sees exactly the
//! affordances its caps authorize ([`AffordanceSurface::project_for`]).
//!
//! ## The pieces
//!
//! 1. [`CellAffordance`] — a named operation + the [`AuthRequired`] a viewer must
//!    HOLD + the real [`dregg_turn::Effect`] it would fire.
//! 2. [`AffordanceSurface`] — a cell's published set of affordances, with the
//!    per-viewer projection ([`AffordanceSurface::project_for`]) and the cap-gated
//!    fire ([`AffordanceSurface::fire`] / [`AffordanceSurface::fire_through_executor`]).
//! 3. [`AffordanceRegistry`] — the in-process registry apps populate through
//!    [`crate::starbridge::StarbridgeAppContext::register_affordance_surface`],
//!    alongside the existing factory/inspector registries.
//! 4. [`AffordanceSurface::descriptor`] — the anti-drift surface descriptor
//!    [`crate::webgen`] renders for the page (elements + required rights + the post
//!    endpoints), from the Rust source of truth.
//!
//! The HTTP fire endpoint ([`crate::affordance::router`]) uses the existing
//! `middleware`/`authorizer` proof/cap check, pointed at the affordance's
//! `required ⊆ held`.
