//! Ring trade participation trait for pyana apps.
//!
//! Wraps `pyana_intent::solver` types. Apps that want to contribute liquidity
//! to multi-party ring trades implement [`RingTradeParticipant`] and register
//! with a solver coordinator. The solver calls `exchange_offers` to enumerate
//! what the app currently offers, then calls `settle_leg` / `rollback_leg` for
//! the legs it assigns to this app in an atomic settlement round.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pyana_app_framework::ring_trade::{RingTradeParticipant, ExchangeSpec, Settlement};
//!
//! impl RingTradeParticipant for MyAMM {
//!     type Error = MyError;
//!     fn exchange_offers(&self) -> Vec<ExchangeSpec> { self.pool_offers() }
//!     fn settle_leg(&mut self, s: &Settlement) -> Result<(), MyError> { self.execute(s) }
//!     fn rollback_leg(&mut self, s: &Settlement) -> Result<(), MyError> { self.undo(s) }
//! }
//! ```
