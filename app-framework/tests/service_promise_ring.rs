//! End-to-end prototype: two cells exchange a SERVICE for PAYMENT via the ring.
//!
//! A provider promises a service for payment; a consumer pays for it. The ring
//! matches them, the payment is ESCROWED against the promise, and then either the
//! provider FULFILLS (proves its service turn ran → payment released) or the
//! promise LAPSES (→ payment refunded). This test proves the four contracts:
//!
//!   1. HAPPY PATH   — service performed (a signed receipt fills the hole) → paid.
//!   2. REFUND PATH  — unfulfilled past the window → refunded to the consumer.
//!   3. ATOMICITY    — a forged/absent fulfillment never half-pays; release and
//!                     refund are mutually-exclusive one-shots.
//!   4. CONSERVATION — the payment asset's total is preserved across every path.

//! Assurance-perimeter #3: fulfillment is a VERIFIED EffectVM STARK (a
//! `ProvenReceipt`), NOT a trusted signature. The provider commits to the exact
//! state-commitment transition (`expected_pre/post_commitment`) at promise time; a
//! genuine proof of THAT transition fills the hole, a forged/wrong-transition proof
//! does not.
