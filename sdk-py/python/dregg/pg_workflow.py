"""``dregg.pg.workflow`` — durable verified workflows over pg-dregg.

A **durable workflow** is an ordered, named sequence of verified turns driven
through the pg-dregg write spine (``.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md`` §8/§11): each step is a
signed turn enqueued into ``dregg.submit_queue`` (RLS-gated by
``dregg_admits('submit', agent)``), which the node's drainer applies through the
real verified executor (``pending → executed | refused``). The runner here is the
Python face of the shipped ``pg_dregg::workflow`` API (``Workflow`` / ``Step`` /
``WorkflowEngine`` / ``run_durable`` / ``resume_durable`` / ``recover_from_durable``
— ``pg-dregg/examples/subscription_billing.rs`` is its behavioral reference), but
realized over the **live, persisted** submit-queue rows rather than the Rust
engine's in-memory ``MemLog``. That distinction is the whole point of *durable*:
the durability that survives a crash lives in the committed
``dregg.submit_queue`` rows, which only the SQL path reaches.

THE THREE PROPERTIES the runner gives a Python user (the lane's deliverable):

* **(a) a durable verified workflow** — :meth:`DurableWorkflow.run` enqueues each
  step's signed turn and drives it to a terminal outcome. The enqueue is a
  committed pg row (durable the instant ``dregg_submit_turn`` returns), so a
  process crash mid-run loses the in-memory runner but **not** the enqueued
  turns.
* **exactly-once across crashes** — :meth:`DurableWorkflow.resume` reconciles the
  workflow against what is ALREADY in ``dregg.submit_queue_audit``: a step whose
  turn already enqueued/executed is **skipped, never re-submitted** (the fast
  path), and even if a stale step *were* re-submitted, the node's chain tooth
  refuses it as a replay (the backstop). This is the same dual enforcement the
  Rust ``resume_durable`` documents ("we skip by index … the chain is the
  backstop"), keyed here by a per-step **idempotency key** the runner stamps so a
  resumed run recognizes its own already-committed steps.
* it composes with **(b) cap-gated reads** and **(c) verified writes** from
  :mod:`dregg.pg` unchanged — a workflow reads state back as free SQL
  (:meth:`dregg.pg.Pg.cell_balances`) and every write IS a verified turn.

THE HONEST SEAM (named, per ``.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md`` §11.4 / §13). The
soundness-load-bearing halves — the durable enqueue, the ``submit_gate`` RLS, and
the audit-reconciliation that makes resume exactly-once — are **real and enforced
by the database engine** and are exercised against live pg18. The transition that
*executes* a queued turn (``pending → executed``, writing the receipt) is the
**node drainer's** job (M3: ``node/src/pg_submit_drainer.rs`` →
``execute_via_producer`` → the real Lean executor). Where no live node/drainer is
running, :class:`LocalDrainer` stands in for it for dev + tests — it is a
deliberately-minimal ``dregg_kernel``-role applicator that marks a row executed,
NOT the verified executor, and it says so. A production deployment runs the real
drainer and never touches :class:`LocalDrainer`.

        The live ``dregg.submit_queue`` carries no idempotency column (idempotency
        is the chain tooth's job; this is the fast-path reconciliation over it), so
        the runner correlates by matching each step's ``(agent, signed_turn)``
        against the outbox rows the presented capability can see. A step whose
        exact ``(agent, signed_turn)`` already appears executed is recognized as
        committed; a pending one is awaited rather than re-enqueued. This is a
        conservative reconciliation — it never skips a step it cannot positively
        match, so the worst case is a chain-refused re-submit (the backstop), never
        a lost step."""

# ───────────────────────── the dev/test drainer stand-in ─────────────────────


class LocalDrainer:
    """A **dev/test stand-in** for the node's submit-queue drainer — NOT the
    verified executor.

    The real write path (``.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md`` §11.4) is: a pg-user enqueues a
    signed turn; the **node's drainer** (``dregg_kernel`` role) decodes it, runs it
    through the real verified Lean executor (``execute_via_producer``), materializes
    the post-state, and stamps the queue row ``executed`` (with the receipt) or
    ``refused``. That drainer is node-side M3 work and is the only thing that turns
    a queued *intent* into verified *state*.

    Where no live node is running (a bare ``cargo pgrx`` cluster, a unit/dev box),
    this stand-in lets the durable-workflow *runner* be driven end-to-end against
    real pg18: it assumes the ``dregg_kernel`` role (BYPASSRLS, the only writer)
    and resolves a pending row to ``executed`` with a synthetic receipt hash — so
    the runner's enqueue → await → exactly-once loop is exercised against genuine
    persisted rows. It performs **no turn verification and writes no cell state**;
    it is explicitly a transport stub for the drain transition. A
    :attr:`refuse_predicate` lets a test drive the *refused* arm (e.g. "a turn for a
    cancelled agent is refused"), modelling the spine's fail-closed behavior
    without a real executor.

    Use it ONLY in dev/test. In production the node drainer does this, and the
    runner is called with ``drainer=None``.

    REVOCATION re-check (faithful to the real drainer). Like the node drainer
    (``dregg-pg``'s ``dregg_drain_once``, the
    ``drainer_refuses_a_revoked_since_enqueue_intent_at_drain`` test), this
    stand-in re-checks the row's persisted ``submit_token`` against the revocation
    registry (``dregg_cap_not_revoked``) BEFORE resolving — so a capability revoked
    AFTER enqueue but before drain causes the queued turn to resolve ``refused``
    (reason ``"revoked"``), never executed. This is where pg-dregg's
    instant-revocation actually bites in the write path: NOT at enqueue (the
    ``submit_gate`` checks only the cap's caveats), but at the drain re-check. Pass
    ``check_revocation=False`` to disable it (e.g. to model a deployment with no
    revocation tier)."""
