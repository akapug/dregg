# dregg — the Python SDK

The pyo3 binding for the dregg SDK's two-noun surface:

```python
import dregg

ident = dregg.Identity.from_profile("ember")      # ~/.dregg/profiles, shared with the CLI
receipt = (ident.turn("http://localhost:8421")    # your local node — see QUICKSTART.md
                .transfer("28c2cba0…", 100)
                .sign()
                .submit())
print(receipt.turn_hash, receipt.has_proof)
```

There is no public server (the former `devnet.dregg.fg-goose.online` is offline);
run a node locally first (`QUICKSTART.md`). A remote/operator node gates the
signed-turn ingress (`devnet_key=` / `$DREGG_API_TOKEN`); your own
`--enable-faucet` dev node leaves it open.

An unauthorized act is inexpressible: nothing leaves `.sign()` until it is a
real Ed25519-signed canonical `SignedTurn`, and the node ingress verifies it.
The module is fully typed — it ships `dregg.pyi` + a `py.typed` marker, so
IDEs, mypy, and pyright resolve the whole surface.

## The organ nouns

Above the two base nouns sit the **organs** (`.docs-history-noclaude/ORGANS.md`) — the higher
primitives, each the ergonomic Python face of a node service. The node computes
the per-cell factory descriptors and seal fan-outs the wire layer does not
carry; these clients drive them. The enforcement tooth is the
executor-installed cell program either way.

```python
# §1 Trustline — the bilateral line of credit (operator-gated).
tl = issuer.trustline(node, devnet_key=KEY)
line = tl.open(holder.cell_id, 1000)        # four-turn funded birth
tl.draw(line["trustline"], 250)             # debit the shared counter
tl.status(line["trustline"])                # {line, drawn, remaining, escrow, open, …}

# §4 Channels — the group-key epoch lift (operator-gated).
ch = issuer.channels(node, devnet_key=KEY)
g = ch.create(7, [{"cell": alice.cell_id, "seal_pk": alice_seal_hex}])
ch.remove(g["channel"], bob.cell_id)        # bob darkened in ONE epoch step
for m in ch.messages(g["channel"]): ...     # SSE ciphertext envelopes

# §2 Mailbox — a hosted inbox over the relay (owner-signed).
mb = holder.mailbox("http://relay.example:3100")
mb.subscribe()                              # create your inbox
out = mb.drain(50)                          # each carries a dequeue (custody) proof

# Light-client reads — no identity, no signing.
aq = dregg.AttestedQuery(node)
aq.checkpoint()                             # latest finalized checkpoint (+ qc votes)
aq.turn_proof(turn_hash)                    # full-turn STARK bytes (verify elsewhere)

# Faucet (a dev node started with --enable-faucet) — materialize + fund a cell.
dregg.faucet(node, ident.cell_id, 2000, public_key=ident.public_key)
```

**Honest scope.** Operator-gated organs (trustline, channels) carry the node
operator's credential (`devnet_key=`, else `$DREGG_API_TOKEN`). Sealing
(X25519 → ChaCha20-Poly1305), the per-group seal fan-out, re-running a dequeue
Merkle verifier, and verifying a STARK/threshold signature are **not** done in
this binding — it surfaces the artifacts to verify with the Rust/Lean path. See
`examples/organs.py`.

## DreggDL — the checkable deployment spec (`dregg.deploy`)

Write a dregg capability layout **once**, declaratively (TOML / JSON), and
`check` it for the four static guarantees — conservation, non-amplification,
well-formedness, ring-balance — over the WHOLE declared authority layout BEFORE
submitting, exactly like the Rust `dregg-deploy check` CLI:

```python
import dregg.deploy as deploy

verdict = deploy.check(open("escrow.dregg.toml").read())
if not verdict["pass"]:
    for f in verdict["assurance"]["findings"]:
        print(f"{f['guarantee']}: {f['message']} @ {f['locus']['display']}")
# verdict = {pass, assurance{conservation, no_amplification, wellformed,
#            ring_balance, findings}, factories[], cells[], turn_count}

forest = deploy.lower(toml_text)   # the ordered CallForest the checker consumes
```

`dregg.deploy` is a **thin binding** over the REAL `dregg-deploy` crate: parse →
`Lowered::from_deployment` (name resolution + the ordered `CallForest`) →
`dregg_userspace_verify::analyze`. The lowering, the `CallForest` construction,
and the checks are NOT reimplemented in Python — a deployment audited from
Python is audited by the exact same code as `dregg-deploy check`. An
over-granting deployment FAILs with the located amplification; an unknown row
raises `DreggError` naming it.

## pg-dregg-native — drive pg-dregg from Python (`dregg.pg`)

`dregg.pg` is a thin, well-typed `psycopg`-based binding of the **real** pg-dregg
SQL surface (`.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md`): a Python user connects to a pg-dregg-enabled
PostgreSQL and lets pg-dregg enforce. The model is the spine — **reads are free
SQL; state mutates only through verified turns** — so the surface falls into
exactly that shape. `psycopg` is imported lazily; install it with
`pip install 'dregg[pg]'`.

```python
from dregg import pg

with pg.connect("host=/var/run/postgresql dbname=dregg", token=my_dga1_token) as db:
    # (b) cap-gated reads — only the cells the presented token admits 'read' on.
    for c in db.cell_balances():            # free SQL over dregg.cell_balances, RLS-gated
        print(c.cell, c.balance)
    head = db.chain_head()                  # the receipt hash chain (anti-substitution tooth)

    # (c) a verified write — submit a signed turn through the spine (RLS-gated to
    #     the agents the token admits 'submit' on); the node drains it.
    sid = db.submit_turn(signed_turn_bytes, agent_cell)
    print(db.submission(sid).status)        # pending → executed | refused
```

### (a) Durable verified workflows (`dregg.pg.DurableWorkflow`)

An ordered, named sequence of verified turns, driven durably — **each step a
verified turn, exactly-once across crashes**. The Python face of
`pg_dregg::workflow` (`pg-dregg/examples/subscription_billing.rs` is the
behavioral reference), realized over the **persisted** `dregg.submit_queue` rows
(durability that survives a crash lives in the committed rows, which only the SQL
path reaches):

```python
wf = (db.durable_workflow("monthly-billing")
        .step("charge alice", alice_cell, alice_turn_bytes)
        .step("charge bob",   bob_cell,   bob_turn_bytes))
report = wf.run(db)            # enqueue each (durable), drive to executed | refused
# …process crashes, restarts…
report = wf.resume(db)         # reconciles the persisted queue: skips alice (already
                               # committed), re-drives only the uncommitted tail
print(report.committed, report.skipped)
```

Exactly-once is dual-enforced (the same as the Rust `resume_durable`): a committed
step is skipped by reconciliation (the fast path), and even a stale re-submit is
refused by the node's chain tooth (the backstop). A cancelled subscription is a
`dregg_revoke` — the next charge is refused on the very next turn (instant
revocation, consulted by the `submit_gate` RLS).

**Honest seam.** The durable enqueue, the `submit_gate` RLS, and the crash-resume
reconciliation are **real and enforced by the database engine** (exercised against
live pg18 in `tests/test_pg_workflow.py`). The transition that *executes* a queued
turn (`pending → executed`) is the **node drainer's** job (it runs each turn
through the real verified Lean executor; `.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §11.4). Where no node
runs, `dregg.pg.LocalDrainer` stands in for dev/tests — a `dregg_kernel`-role
applicator that resolves the row (and faithfully re-checks revocation) but is NOT
the verified executor. See `examples/pg_durable_workflow.py` for the full
recurring-billing story (cap-gated, instant-revocation, crash-resume) against live
pg-dregg.

## Two builds: the Rust executor (default) vs the embedded Lean kernel

The SDK **always ships a local executor** — Rust by default, the verified Lean
kernel when you opt in. The whole client surface (`Identity` +
`turn`/`transfer`/`sign`/`submit`, the organs, `AttestedQuery`, `deploy.check`,
`dregg.pg`, profiles, the receipt stream, the program atoms) is Ed25519 + the
canonical wire codec + blocking HTTP and works identically in both builds.

`pip install dregg` gives you the **light** wheel: a small, toolchain-free wheel
whose local executor is the pure-Rust `TurnExecutor` (`dregg-turn`). It links no
`libleanshared` (~150 MB) and needs no Lean toolchain on the host. The Rust
executor is at **parity with the verified Lean spec** (a dedicated lane
strengthens + documents that Rust↔Lean parity — that parity is the justification
for trusting the Rust producer). `dregg.kernel()` PROVES the active executor by
driving one real transfer through it:

```python
>>> dregg.kernel()                       # the default LIGHT wheel
{'build': 'light', 'lean': False, 'executor': 'rust', 'producer': 'rust',
 'executor_present': True, 'executor_step_ok': True, 'verified_step_ok': False,
 'executor_step_out': '{"executor":"rust","cells":[["src",…],["dst",15]],"transferred":5,"ok":1}'}
```

The **embedded verified Lean kernel** (`metatheory/Dregg2`, via `dregg-lean-ffi`
— the same executor every native dregg binary runs) is the optional heavy build,
`dregg[kernel]`. It links `libdregg_lean.a` (the Dregg2 module objects) +
`libleanshared`; the active executor is then `lean` and `dregg.kernel()` proves
it by driving the transfer through the proved `Exec.recKExec`:

```python
>>> dregg.kernel()                       # the dregg[kernel] wheel
{'build': 'kernel', 'lean': True, 'executor': 'lean', 'producer': 'lean',
 'executor_present': True, 'executor_step_ok': True, 'verified_step_ok': True,
 'executor_step_out': '{"cells":[[1,…45…],[2,…15…]],"ok":1}'}
```

`verified_step_ok` is true only when the executor that ran the step was the
*verified Lean* one; the Rust producer is at-parity, not itself the proved
kernel. The kernel wheel is the **same `dregg` package** compiled with the Rust
`kernel` feature (see *Building*); its Lean runtime is initialized once, at
`import dregg`, on the importing thread.

## How the link works (shared mode — the kernel build only)

A Python extension module is a shared object, and the Lean *static* runtime archives
cannot be linked into one on ELF (`libleanrt.a`'s mimalloc objects use local-exec TLS —
`R_X86_64_TPOFF32` relocations are illegal under `-shared`). So this crate builds with
`DREGG_LEAN_LINK=shared` (set by `.cargo/config.toml`; an env var, not a cargo feature,
so it can never feature-unify onto the native crates):

* `libdregg_lean.a` (the Dregg2 + dependency *module* objects, compiled `-fPIC`) is
  still linked statically — that is the verified kernel itself;
* the Lean **runtime + stdlib** resolve against the toolchain's shared libraries
  (`libleanshared`, `libLake_shared`, and on platforms where the split is real
  `libInit_shared`/`libleanshared_1`/`libleanshared_2`) from `$LEAN_SYSROOT/lib/lean`;
* `build.rs` stamps an rpath to the active elan toolchain's `lib/lean`, so dev builds
  import with no environment setup on the machine that built them.

## Building

**Light (default) — the kernel-free client.** No Lean toolchain, no
`libleanshared`; this is what `pip install dregg` ships:

```sh
cd sdk-py
cargo build                  # default features = ["light"]; no `lake`/elan needed
maturin build --release      # the small client wheel
# maturin develop            # build + install into the active venv
python3 -c 'import dregg; print(dregg.kernel())'   # → {'build': 'light', …}
```

Without `maturin`, the built cdylib works directly: copy
`target/debug/libdregg.dylib` (macOS) / `target/debug/libdregg.so` (Linux) to
`dregg.so` somewhere on `sys.path`.

**Kernel (`dregg[kernel]`) — the embedded verified Lean kernel.** The elan
toolchain and `lake` must be on PATH (`./scripts/bootstrap.sh` at the repo root
checks everything); the `kernel` feature leaves `no-lean-link` off, so
`dregg-lean-ffi` links the archive + `libleanshared` in shared mode
(`DREGG_LEAN_LINK=shared`, set by `.cargo/config.toml`):

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features kernel
maturin build --release --no-default-features --features kernel
python3 -c 'import dregg; print(dregg.kernel())'   # → {'build': 'kernel', 'lean': True, …}
```

## Wheels (distribution)

The **light** wheel is the publishing default: small, self-contained (it links
no Lean runtime, bakes no rpath), and importable on any host with no toolchain.

The **kernel** wheel embeds `libleanshared`. The rpath baked by `build.rs` points
at the *building* machine's elan toolchain, so a kernel wheel runs elsewhere only
if libleanshared is findable. Two stories:

1. **Toolchain-on-host:** the host installs the pinned Lean toolchain (elan) and,
   if it lives elsewhere, points the loader at it:
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LEAN_SYSROOT/lib/lean` (Linux) /
   `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LEAN_SYSROOT/lib/lean` (macOS). Build-time override:
   `DREGG_LEAN_SYSROOT=<sysroot>` bakes that rpath instead.
2. **Bundled (self-contained kernel wheels):** graft the shared libraries into the
   wheel with the standard repair tools — `auditwheel repair` (Linux) /
   `delocate-wheel` (macOS) after `maturin build --release --features kernel`.
   They rewrite the rpath to the wheel-internal copy. Expect large wheels
   (libleanshared is ~150 MB unstripped) — this is exactly why the light client is
   the default.

## Tests

```sh
python3 -m pytest tests/    # needs the module importable (maturin develop, or copy the cdylib)
```

`tests/test_smoke.py` covers profiles/signing/submit against an in-process mock
node, plus the executor probe (`test_kernel_probe_reports_executor` — it asserts
the active executor ran a real transfer: the Rust `TurnExecutor` in the light
build, the proved `Exec.recKExec` in the kernel build). The deploy/pg surfaces
have their own files
(`test_deploy.py`, `test_pg*.py`; pg integration is skip-gated on a live
postgres).

### The drift-killer (`cargo test`, from THIS directory)

```sh
cd sdk-py && cargo test          # sdk-py is EXCLUDED from the root workspace
```

`tests/wire_drift_killer.rs` is the gate that keeps this SDK honest about the
protocol. sdk-py is in the root workspace's `exclude` list, so no root
`cargo build`/`cargo test` and no CI job ever compiles it — **it is only built
when built from this directory.** The gate drives the SHIPPED signing path
(`build_signed_turn`, the exact function `TurnBuilder.sign()` calls) through the
REAL `TurnExecutor` and pins four things: turns commit at every nonce (not just
an agent's first), actions carry a VERIFYING hybrid ed25519 + ML-DSA-65
authorization, `CapabilityRef::provenance` is canonical and survives the wire,
and `.write()` reaches the wide ext plane past the 16 fixed slots. Its vocabulary
leg reads `../turn/src/action.rs` at test time and FAILS LOUD if the protocol
grows an `Effect` variant sdk-py has never considered — there is no cached oracle
that can rot into a false green.

**Why this SDK does not re-implement the codec.** Unlike `sdk-ts` (which must
port the postcard codec to TypeScript, and shipped an npm release that silently
dropped `CapabilityRef::provenance`), sdk-py depends on `dregg-turn` /
`dregg-cell` **by path** and encodes with the same `postcard` the node decodes
with. Mis-encoding is therefore structurally impossible here — but that buys
less than it sounds like: it says nothing about whether a turn is *accepted*,
which is why the gate commits turns through the executor rather than stopping at
bytes.

### Named residual: the receipt chain is not plumbed

`AgentCipherclerk::make_turn_for` takes `previous_receipt_hash` from the clerk's
`receipt_chain`, and this SDK never appends to it (a `.submit()` returns the
node's JSON, not a `TurnReceipt`), so every Python turn claims
`previous_receipt_hash: None`. This is accepted today **only because the node
builds a fresh executor per request** (`executor_setup::new_submit_executor`), so
the per-agent `last_receipt_hash` map the check consults is always empty. The
executor's own source calls this out as the client's debt to pay
(`turn/src/executor/execute.rs`, `REVIEW[cclerk-coord]`: "the cclerk must be
updated to plumb the prior receipt hash … This check should NOT be relaxed").
If a node ever holds a persistent executor across submits, every non-first
Python turn breaks with `ReceiptChainMismatch`. Closing it needs either a node
endpoint exposing an agent's chain head (`/api/cell/{id}` does not carry one
today) or a `.submit()` that folds the returned receipt back into the clerk.
