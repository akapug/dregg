// THE VOCABULARY GATE — sdk-ts's half of the sdk-py drift-killer.
//
// ## WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (the structural story, not a scandal)
//
// The two SDKs are an accidental controlled experiment. sdk-py CANNOT
// mis-encode: it depends on dregg-turn/dregg-cell by PATH and encodes with the
// same `postcard` the node decodes with, so it never had M30's dropped
// `provenance` and it got hybrid PQ signing for free. sdk-ts MUST port the codec
// to TypeScript and therefore drifts — and did. Same team, same week, opposite
// outcomes: STRUCTURE, not diligence.
//
// The repo already carries the strongest oracle available to a TS port:
// `wire.test.mjs` compares TS bytes against the FRESHLY-BUILT dregg-wasm, i.e.
// the real Rust codec, rebuilt by the `pretest` hook on every run. That closes
// mis-encoding for what it compares.
//
// It cannot close what it does not compare. Rust's `Effect` has 38 variants;
// as of 2026-09-30 the TS union models ALL 38 (each driven through the oracle
// by `wire-effects.test.mjs`). A 39th variant, a renamed field, or a new field
// on a modeled variant is still INVISIBLE to a byte comparison over hand-built
// fixtures. That is the remaining silent channel, and this file closes it — the
// way sdk-py closes it: by reading the protocol's own source at test time and
// refusing to pass when the vocabulary has moved.
//
// ## THE DIVISION OF LABOUR (why the pair is airtight)
//
//   * `wire.test.mjs`  — BYTES. For the modeled variants, the encoding equals the
//                        real Rust postcard, oracle rebuilt fresh every run.
//   * this file        — VOCABULARY. The modeled variants are still the same
//                        NAME, INDEX and FIELD SET in Rust, and the unmodeled
//                        remainder is still exactly the declared set.
//
// Between them: a field added to a modeled variant → RED here (field set) and
// RED there (bytes). A variant inserted or reordered → RED here (index pin) and
// RED there (discriminant). A variant appended → RED here. A field renamed →
// RED here. None of those can pass silently.
//
// ## THE LEDGER BELOW IS THE POINT
//
// `MODELED` and `UNMODELED` together must equal the Rust enum EXACTLY, in both
// directions. That is what converts a protocol change from a silent byte
// difference into a RED test naming the variant. A new Rust variant cannot be
// absorbed by this gate: someone must add it to `MODELED` (and teach the codec)
// or to `UNMODELED` (and write down WHY the SDK does not carry it). The
// unmodeled list is not a shrug — it is sdk-ts stating, in the tree, the exact
// subset of the protocol it speaks.
//
// ⚠ NO cached copy, NO checked-in fixture, NO generated artifact. The oracle is
// `../turn/src/action.rs` and `../cell/src/capability.rs`, read on every run.
// Missing or restructured ⇒ THROW, never skip (M30).
