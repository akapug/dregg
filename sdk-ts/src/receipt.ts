/**
 * `Receipt` — the first of the SDK's two user-facing nouns.
 *
 * A `Receipt` is dregg's canonical proof-of-execution artifact: the committed
 * turn's hashes, the pre/post state roots, the agent cell, the federation
 * binding, and the receipt-chain link. Every authorized submission
 * (`AuthorizedTurn.submit()`) returns one, and the event stream
 * (`NodeEvents.subscribe`) yields the same noun — observation and action
 * speak one language.
 *
 * The proof is **lazily attached**: a `Receipt` is born proofless (the commit
 * decision is the executor's; the STARK is additive attestation) and a
 * [`TurnProof`] can be attached when the node's async prove pool produces one
 * (`fetchProof` pulls `/api/turn/{hash}/proof`).
 *
 * The second noun is `AttestedHistory` — the light-client whole-history
 * verdict. It is produced by verifying ONE succinct aggregate and is not yet
 * surfaced on the TS SDK (the verifier is Rust-side).
