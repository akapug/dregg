/**
 * The **service-economy** SDK surface — buy a service in a few lines, over the
 * verified rail. The hand-written TypeScript twin of the Rust SDK facade
 * (`sdk/src/service_economy.rs`): `pay`, `services.invoke`, and a durable,
 * metered `execution.lease`.
 *
 * Every method here is a THIN, HONEST wrapper that builds the SAME `Action` /
 * `Effect` JSON the node executor verifies — the same bytes the Rust
 * `dregg_payable::resolve_pay` / `resolve_invocation` desugars produce. There
 * is no new kernel effect, no new commitment field, and no faking:
 *
 * - `pay(to, amount, asset)` → the canonical `Payable` `pay` desugar: an
 *   action with `method = pay`, `args = [asset, field_from_u64(amount), to]`,
 *   carrying EXACTLY ONE conserving `Effect::Transfer` (per-asset Σδ=0).
 * - `services.invoke(cell, method, args, { pay })` → an action targeting
 *   `cell`'s method, optionally PREPENDING the canonical pay `Transfer` ahead
 *   of the work effects. The verified DFA route + unknown-method / under-
 *   authority refusal are the node executor's job over the wire (the SDK is a
 *   remote client); the action shape is byte-identical to the Rust desugar.
 * - `execution.lease({ maxSteps, asset, leaseCell })` → a `Lease` whose `run`
 *   advances the durable checkpoint (`step → step+1`, a `SetField` on
 *   {@link LEASE_STEP_SLOT}) alongside the workload on ONE turn, and whose
 *   `fund` is a conserving `Effect::Transfer` into the lease cell.
 *
 * ## What is node-side (the honest boundary)
 *
 * The TS SDK is a wire client: it builds + signs + submits turns. Spawning the
 * cap-gated worker and installing the lease meter program
 * (`FieldLte { step ≤ maxSteps } ∧ Monotonic { step }`, see
 * {@link leaseProgramConstraints}) is the cell-provisioning step the in-process
 * Rust `ExecutionLease::open` does locally; over the wire it is done when the
 * lease cell is provisioned. {@link ServiceEconomy.lease} binds to that lease
 * cell and drives the verified `run` / `fund` turns against it — the executor's
 * meter program is what binds the capacity ceiling into every committed
 * transition, exactly as the standalone `starbridge-execution-lease` app's
 * `advance_checkpoint` relies on.
