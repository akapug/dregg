/**
 * # `raw` — UNAUTHORIZED turn construction. Genesis / plumbing ONLY.
 *
 * ## ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE IMPORTING ANYTHING FROM HERE
 *
 * This module is the SDK's **sealed escape hatch**: the raw `Action` /
 * `Turn` vocabulary, including [`unsignedAction`] — the one constructor that
 * expresses *an act carrying no credential at all*
 * (`Authorization::Unchecked`).
 *
 * It exists for exactly two legitimate reasons on the TS surface:
 *
 * 1. **The signing flow itself** — the canonical signing message is computed
 *    over the action *with the authorization field zeroed*
 *    ([`unsignedAction`] is that zeroing step, used internally by
 *    `Identity.signAction` and the `TurnBuilder.sign()` path before the
 *    real signature is attached).
 * 2. **Test fixtures / genesis tooling** that need the wire vocabulary
 *    (postcard encoders, canonical hashes) directly.
 *
 * **Everything else goes through the authorized surface**: an
 * [`Identity`](./identity) building a turn via `runtime.turn()` → typed verb
 * builders → `.sign()` → `.submit()`. On that surface an unauthorized act is
 * **inexpressible** — the authorization field is private to the flow and
 * always a real credential by the time anything executes.
 *
 * If you find yourself importing from `@dregg/sdk/raw` in application code,
 * you are almost certainly building something the executor will reject. The
 * executor's posture: `Unchecked` means "no credential presented; ownership
 * / cell-permission checks decide", and any cell with real permissions
 * rejects it.
 *
 * This is the TS twin of the Rust SDK's quarantined `sdk/src/raw.rs` — same
 * seal, same documentation posture, same wire format.
