/**
 * The authorized turn builder — the SDK's one public turn shape.
 *
 * ```text
 * Identity → .turn() → typed verb builders → .sign() → .submit() → Receipt
 * ```
 *
 * `AgentRuntime.turn()` opens a [`TurnBuilder`]; the typed verbs
 * ([`transfer`], [`write`], [`grant`], …) accumulate the act; [`sign`] binds
 * it to the identity's Ed25519 key over the canonical signing message
 * (federation-bound, replay-separated); and [`AuthorizedTurn.submit`]
 * executes it on the node and returns the [`Receipt`] noun.
 *
 * **An unauthorized act is inexpressible here.** No method on this surface
 * yields an unsigned action — by the time anything reaches the node it
 * carries a real `Authorization::Signature` per action AND a `SignedTurn`
 * envelope signature over the canonical turn hash. The raw vocabulary
 * (including unauthorized construction) lives behind the sealed
 * `@dregg/sdk/raw` module.
 *
 * The anti-blind-signing affordance rides along: [`AuthorizedTurn.explain`]
 * renders the clerk's faithful, total explanation of exactly what was
 * signed.
 *
 * Difference from the Rust builder: there is no `.as_cell(..)` here — the
 * remote signed ingress pins `turn.agent` to the signer's default cell
 * (node/src/api.rs `post_submit_signed_turn`), so a cell-agent turn cannot
 * be expressed over this transport. `.on(target)` (act on another cell the
 * identity administers, signature verified against the target's
 * `owner_pubkey`) works as in Rust.
