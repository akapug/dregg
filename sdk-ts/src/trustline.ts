/**
 * **Trustline** — the bilateral line of credit as an SDK noun
 * (`.docs-history-noclaude/ORGANS.md` §1; Lean twin `metatheory/Dregg2/Apps/Trustline.lean`).
 *
 * "Issuer A extends holder B a line of N" is an ATTENUATED CAPABILITY whose
 * exercise debits a shared counter — the granted ⊆ held relation made
 * QUANTITATIVE. The cell is born from a per-line content-addressed factory
 * whose installed program the executor re-evaluates on EVERY touch: `drawn ≤
 * ceiling` for life, terms pinned, settlement monotone.
 *
 * ## Honest scope (what THIS client can and cannot do)
 *
 * Birthing a trustline cell requires the per-line factory descriptor — a
 * Poseidon2 commitment over the slot schema that the Rust SDK / node compute
 * from `dregg_cell::blueprint`. That machinery is NOT in the TS wire layer
 * (which models the seven typed effects, not factory blueprints). So this
 * client drives the trustline through the **node's operator-local trustline
 * service** (`node/src/trustline_service.rs`, routes `POST /trustline/{open,
 * draw,repay,settle,close}` + `GET /trustline/status/{cell}`): the node
 * computes the descriptor, signs the four-turn funded birth with its own
 * cipherclerk, and welds the Stingray budget coordinator. The enforcement
 * tooth is the executor-installed cell program either way — this client is
 * the ergonomic face of those routes.
 *
 * These routes are operator-gated (the node operator IS the issuer); pass a
 * `devnetKey` on the [`NodeClient`].
 *
 * ```ts
 * const tl = runtime.node.trustline();
 * const line = await tl.open(holderCellHex, 1000n);     // four-turn funded birth
 * await tl.draw(line.trustline, 250n);                  // debit the shared counter
 * await tl.repay(line.trustline, 100n);                 // restore the line
 * const status = await tl.status(line.trustline);       // { line, drawn, remaining, ... }
 * await tl.settle(line.trustline);                      // redeem outstanding to holder
 * await tl.close(line.trustline);                       // residual back to issuer
 * ```
