/**
 * `explain` — the cipherclerk's third reading of a turn (the clerk that
 * cannot misstate what a turn does). A turn term can be **executed**,
 * **proved**, and — here — **explained**: a deterministic rendering of
 * exactly what it does, shown before authorizing. The description on the
 * screen is another reading of the very term that executes, not a caption
 * that can drift.
 *
 * Guarantees (mirroring `sdk/src/explain.rs`):
 *
 * 1. **Totality.** Every modeled `Effect`, `Action`, and `Turn` renders with
 *    no throw. The per-effect switch is exhaustive (a `never` check makes
 *    adding a TS effect variant without a reading a compile error, the same
 *    discipline as Rust's no-`_ =>` match).
 *
 * 2. **Injectivity-on-semantics.** Each rendering carries a canonical
 *    `[sem <digest>]` tag derived from the term's own canonical BLAKE3 hash
 *    (the SAME digest the Rust executor and circuit bind — `Effect::hash` /
 *    `Action::hash`), so two renderings that are textually equal have equal
 *    semantics: the screen cannot show identical text for two turns that
 *    would do different things.
 *
 * NOT claimed: that the prose is a correct natural-language account of
 * intent — only that no other turn renders to the same string unless it has
 * the same semantics.
