# Published-package verification — `@dregg/sdk@0.3.0`

A fresh-consumer check of the package as published on npm (the registry tarball,
not a build from this source tree). Run in a clean temp dir: `npm init -y` then
`npm install @dregg/sdk@0.3.0`. Date: 2026-06-28.

## The hybrid PQ signer (on disk, uncommitted, UNPUBLISHED)

The prerequisite that must land before the node can ever flip `require_pq`.

### Implementation choice: `@noble/post-quantum` (ML-DSA-65, FIPS 204)

`src/internal/mldsa.ts` wraps `@noble/post-quantum`'s `ml_dsa65`. Why this and
not the alternatives:

- **Not a hand-roll.** No lattice arithmetic is written here — only the
  parameter/derivation/context plumbing that pins a real FIPS 204
  implementation to dregg's conventions.
- **Not a wasm binding of the Rust signer**, though that was the tempting
  option (wasm/pkg is already the differential oracle). It would have made the
  DEFAULT signer depend on `dregg-wasm`, which **is not published to npm**
  (`npm view dregg-wasm` → 404). The SDK's front door is deliberately wasm-free;
  routing every signed turn through an unpublished package would turn a
  documented non-gap into a hard one. The wasm stays a *dev-time oracle*, which
  is exactly where it has leverage.
- **Same family as the SDK's existing crypto** (`@noble/ed25519`,
  `@noble/hashes` — already direct dependencies), same maintainer, audited,
  actively maintained, pure JS, zero native/wasm deps, tree-shakeable.
- Its ML-DSA-65 lengths agree with the Rust crate's exactly (pk 1952, sig 3309,
  sk 4032) — and, more to the point, agreement is **driven** (below), not
  assumed.

### Key handling: no new key material, no ceremony

Read from Rust, not invented: `dregg_pq::MlDsaKey::from_ed25519_seed` is
`ml_dsa_65::KG::keygen_from_seed(seed)` — FIPS 204 `ML-DSA.KeyGen(ξ = seed)`
over **the same 32-byte ed25519 seed the classical identity already holds**.
`Identity` holds that seed, so `signAction` derives the PQ keypair itself and
caches it. **A caller supplies nothing new**: existing seeds/mnemonics/profiles
keep working unchanged, and a cipherclerk, a node, and a genesis fixture built
from one mnemonic agree on the PQ public key with no separate ceremony. The
1952-byte public key is *carried in the authorization* (a verifier cannot derive
another party's PQ public key from their ed25519 public key), so it never needs
distributing. `Identity.mlDsaPublicKey()` exposes it for enrollment flows.

Two conventions that are **required**, mirrored from Rust and pinned by the
differential: the FIPS 204 `ctx` is `dregg-hybrid-turn-v1`
(`turn/src/pq.rs::HYBRID_TURN_PQ_CTX`), and signing is the **deterministic**
variant (`rnd = {0}^32`; noble's `extraEntropy: false`, Rust's
`try_sign_with_seed(&[0u8; 32], …)`). Determinism is not a preference: the
ML-DSA half is bound into `Action::hash` (discriminant 10, the anti-strip
binding), which flows into `Turn::hash` — a hedged signature would make the same
logical turn hash differently on every signing, breaking turn identity.

### Driven, against a FRESH oracle + the real verifier

- **Byte-identity** (`test/wire.test.mjs`, oracle rebuilt by `pretest`, verified
  fresh: its embedded serde table reads `struct CapabilityRef with 8 elements`
  and it carries `dregg-action-sig-v3`): a TS hybrid-signed turn is
  **byte-identical** to the Rust DEFAULT-signed turn, over a turn exercising
  every modeled effect incl. `provenance`. **Both sides sign** — the oracle gets
  the UNSIGNED turn and signs it through the real
  `AgentCipherclerk::sign_action`. Matching requires the postcard layout, the
  v3 signing message, the ML-DSA key derivation, the deterministic signature,
  and the ctx to all agree simultaneously.
- **The Rust verifier ACCEPTS it** (`test/hybrid-verify.test.mjs` +
  `test/rust-verifier/`): a standalone Rust bin over path deps on the real
  `dregg-turn`/`dregg-cell` decodes the TS bytes with the real `postcard`/`Turn`
  and runs the real **`TurnExecutor::execute`** — the same public entry the node
  calls — at `require_pq` **OFF and ON**. Both accept. It re-implements nothing;
  every verdict is computed by `dregg-turn` itself.
- **The canaries** (a differential that cannot fail proves nothing):
  - sign classical where hybrid is expected → the byte differential goes **RED**
    (the correction-2 bug, reproduced on demand);
  - the same turn signed classical → executor **accepts at `require_pq=off`,
    REJECTS at `require_pq=on`** (`classical-only signature rejected:
    post-quantum (hybrid) authorization required`) — the cliff itself, proving
    the acceptance gate discriminates;
  - a hybrid signature bound to the **wrong turn nonce** → **REJECTED**
    (`hybrid: Ed25519 (classical) signature half failed`) — the v3 nonce binding
    is load-bearing, not decorative.
- The `hybrid authorization boundary` tripwire is **kept**, now guarding the
  other direction: if the Rust default ever stops being hybrid, the TS default
  silently becomes wrong, and that test is where you learn it.
- Suite: **88/88 green**.

### Cost (measured, not estimated)

| | classical | hybrid | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turn wire size (1 effect) | 285 B | 5551 B | **+5266 B (19.5×)** |
| `signAction` | 0.57 ms | 17.07 ms | **+16.5 ms (30×)** |
| ML-DSA-65 keygen | — | 3.02 ms | once per `Identity` (cached) |

`dist/index.mjs` 20.49 KB → **6137 B gzipped**; `@noble/post-quantum`'s ml-dsa
adds ~37 KB unbundled (`ml-dsa.js` 29 KB + `_crystals.js` 7.8 KB), tree-shakeable
and only pulled by the signing path. **3309-byte signatures are not free**: the
19.5× wire growth is the dominant cost and is inherent to ML-DSA-65 (it is the
same cost the Rust SDK already pays). 17 ms/turn is acceptable for an
interactive signing step but would matter for bulk signing.

### What the `require_pq` flip now costs TS users: nothing

That is the point of this work. The same TS-signed turn is accepted at
`require_pq` OFF and ON (driven above), so the flip is a **no-op** for TS
callers on this code — no re-signing, no key ceremony, no API change. The
flip's TIMING remains ember's call; the signer is engineering, and it is done.
**Classical stays available and explicit** (`Identity.signActionClassical`) for
the pre-flip world and for verifiers predating `HybridSignature` — it is
accepted today and goes dark at the flip, exactly as Rust's
`sign_action_classical` does.

## Result: the published package works for a fresh consumer.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Installs clean from the registry | yes | `added 3 packages, found 0 vulnerabilities` — `@dregg/sdk` + `@noble/ed25519` + `@noble/hashes`. No `dregg-wasm` install nag (it is an *optional* peer). |
| ESM import (`import * from "@dregg/sdk"`) | yes | loads, 46 exports. |
| CJS require (`require("@dregg/sdk")`) | yes | loads, same 46 exports. |
| API produces valid turns | yes | `pay`, `turn().pay()`, `services.invoke` (with pay leg), `execution.lease` all construct + `.sign()` offline (pinned federation id, no node, no wasm) and expose the signed `Action`/`Effect`. |
| Turn ENCODER byte-faithful (postcard layout, incl. `provenance`, + v3 hash) | **yes at HEAD** (was NO for `grantCapability` on 0.3.0 — dropped `provenance`, ⚠ correction 1) | verified against a freshly-built wasm oracle; see below. |
| Action SIGNING MESSAGE matches Rust | **yes at HEAD** (was **NO on 0.3.0 and at HEAD until now** — TS was `sig-v2`, Rust is `sig-v3`; ✅ correction 3) | the v2 message is REJECTED by the real executor; the v3 one is accepted. Driven. |
| Signed-turn byte-identical to the current Rust signer | **yes at HEAD** (was NO — TS signed classical, Rust's default is HYBRID PQ; ✅ correction 3 closes ⚠ correction 2) | TS hybrid-signed turn == Rust default-signed turn, byte for byte, vs a fresh oracle, both sides signing. |
| Rust verifier ACCEPTS a TS-signed turn | **yes at HEAD**, at `require_pq` OFF **and ON** (was **NO at any setting** — the v2 message failed ed25519) | the real `TurnExecutor::execute` via `test/rust-verifier/`. |
| Live-node round-trip | node-down | the devnet edge is down; no reachable dregg node. The SDK fails cleanly. |

## Public surface (46 exports)

`Identity`, `AgentRuntime`, `TurnBuilder`, `AuthorizedTurn`, `ServiceEconomy`,
`Lease`, `NodeClient`, `Receipt`/`ReceiptStream`/`ReceiptFilter`, `NodeEvents`,
`TrustlineClient`/`ChannelsClient`/`MailboxClient`, `AttestedQuery`, `TurnProof`,
`Pg`, `DeployChecker`, `profiles`, `program`, the `explain*`/`render*` helpers,
the `hex*`/`base64*`/`fieldFromU64` codecs, and the `symbol`/role/method
constants. (`AgentRuntime`/`ServiceEconomy` are the front door; `program`,
`leaseProgramConstraints`, the codecs are the building blocks.)

## API sample (from the published package, no node, no wasm)

`pay`: `method == symbol("pay")`, `target == payer cell`,
`args == [asset, fieldFromU64(amount), to]`, effects = exactly one conserving
`Transfer { from: <payer>, to, amount }`. `services.invoke` with a pay leg →
`[Transfer(payer→provider), <work>]`. `lease.run` → `method == symbol("run")`,
`[SetField(slot 4 → step+1), <work>]`.

## Byte-faithfulness to Rust

Two independent confirmations, both computable inside the published package:

1. **`pay` action shape.** The published TS emits
   `args = [asset, field_from_u64(amount), to]` and one conserving `Transfer`.
   This matches `dregg-payable/src/payable.rs::pay_args` byte-for-byte
   (`vec![asset, field_from_u64(amount), to_felt]`) and the documented
   `resolve_pay` desugar in `sdk/src/service_economy.rs`.
2. **Content-addressed program VK.** `program.canonicalProgramVk(...)` recomputed
   in the published TS for the lease meter program `FieldLte{slot4 ≤ n} ∧
   Monotonic{slot4}` reproduces the Rust `dregg_cell::factory::canonical_program_vk`
   source-of-truth digests exactly for n ∈ {1, 2, 8}. A byte-identical postcard
   encoding is the only way to hit those content addresses.

Both confirmations above are about the **pay / lease** front door (a `Transfer`
and a `SetField`); **neither exercises a `CapabilityRef`**, which is why they held
while the `grantCapability` path drifted (see the ⚠ correction at the top).

The repo's own dev-time wire differential (`test/wire.test.mjs`) asserts byte
equality between the TS wire encoder and the actual Rust `dregg-turn`/`dregg-sdk`
code. **⚠ Until 2026-07-16 its oracle was a gitignored, never-rebuilt `wasm/pkg`
snapshot** — a stale mirror that blessed the encoder's own omissions rather than
catching them. It now rebuilds the wasm fresh (`pretest`) and **fails loud** when
the oracle is absent (verified: hiding the built `.wasm` makes the differential
error, not skip). Since correction 3 the differential no longer dodges the
signature: **both sides sign** and the whole hybrid-signed turn is compared byte
for byte, so drift in the postcard layout, the hashes, the signing message, the
ML-DSA derivation, the signing determinism, or the FIPS 204 ctx fails here
against **current** Rust. It remains a source-tree test (needs the `dregg-wasm`
dev dependency), not a fresh-consumer test.

`test/hybrid-verify.test.mjs` + `test/rust-verifier/` add the half a
byte-differential structurally cannot cover: an encoder-vs-encoder comparison
says the bytes MATCH, never that they are ACCEPTED. The harness runs the real
`TurnExecutor::execute` over the TS bytes at `require_pq` off and on. It is a
standalone cargo workspace (never feature-unifies onto the repo's resolve),
builds via `--manifest-path`, and **fails loud** if it cannot build.

✅ **The oracle now builds.** Both blockers noted in the previous revision are
clear: (b) the `starbridge-v2` `CustomProofStateBindingMismatch` match arm is
present on `main`, and (a) the wasm `CC` is handled — `pretest` needs
`CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang` on a stock macOS box
(Apple clang has no wasm target). CI must still set that `CC`. **⚠ These two
blockers are the whole reason corrections 1 and 2 shipped false claims: an
oracle that cannot build is an oracle that never ran, and the prose filled the
gap. Keeping the oracle buildable IS the gate — not a convenience.**

⚠ **Oracle limitation (`sign_turn_v3` signs at nonce 0).** `sign_turn_v3` builds
a FRESH `AgentCipherclerk`, whose `next_turn_nonce()` (receipt-chain length) is
**0**, and signs every `Unchecked` action over that — it never reads
`turn.nonce`. Since `sig-v3` binds the nonce, any turn the oracle signs is only
self-consistent at nonce 0, so the byte differentials ride nonce 0 by
construction. This is a fidelity gap in `wasm/src/lib.rs` (out of scope here —
`wasm/` is read-only for this work) and is worth closing so the oracle can sign
at a caller-supplied nonce. The Rust-verifier harness has no such limit and
covers the nonce binding directly (incl. the wrong-nonce falsifier).

## The wasm peer-dependency story (no gap for the front door)

The core front door (`@dregg/sdk`) is fully wasm-free: the published
`dist/index.{js,mjs}` contain **zero** `dregg-wasm` references, and every
construction + signing path above ran with **no** `dregg-wasm` installed. A basic
user does **not** need `dregg-wasm`.

`dregg-wasm` is referenced only by the **legacy** `@dregg/sdk/wasm` subpath (the
pre-refinement playground surface: token ops, STARK toys, in-browser sim). That
subpath still imports without it (the wasm module is lazy-loaded; it would only
throw when a wasm-backed method is actually called).

`dregg-wasm` is **not published on npm** (`npm view dregg-wasm` → 404; the
manifest lists it as `file:../wasm/pkg`). This is correct for 0.3.0 because the
front door does not use it. It is a real gap **only** for a consumer of the
legacy `@dregg/sdk/wasm` surface — they have no published wasm package to install.

## Live-node round-trip

No reachable dregg node at verification time:
- `devnet.dregg.fg-goose.online` → TLS internal error (down; recovery in flight).
  The SDK surfaces this as a clean `fetch failed`.
- `www.dregg.net` / `dregg.net` → the marketing site (HTML), not a node API.

The full sign → submit → `Receipt` path is covered against a mock node in
`test/service-economy.test.mjs` ("pay rides the full path"). The SDK's
turn-construction (the core) is proven here; only the network bonus is pending a
live node.

## Republish requirements (EMBER-GATED — do NOT `npm publish` autonomously)

Everything above is on disk, **uncommitted and unpublished**. Publishing is
outward-facing and gated, and ember's standing call is that the SDK gets a real
overhaul before it is republished at all. Nothing here should be read as "ready
to ship" — it is a record of what a republish would need.

- **Version:** the public API **changed** (`Identity.signAction` takes a required
  `turnNonce`; the default emitted authorization is now `HybridSignature`; new
  `signActionClassical` / `mlDsaPublicKey` / `NodeClientOptions.nonce`). That is
  a **minor** (`0.4.0`), not the previously-planned `0.3.1` patch. `package.json`
  still pins `0.3.0` and is deliberately **not** bumped here.
- **What is broken on `0.3.0` (impact — worse than previously recorded):**
  **every signed turn**, not just `grantCapability`. `0.3.0` signs the
  `dregg-action-sig-v2` message; the node verifies `v3`, so the ed25519 check
  fails and the node **rejects the turn outright** (driven: `invalid
  authorization: Ed25519 signature verification failed`). pay, lease, service,
  transfer, set-field, events, grantCapability — all of it. The
  `grantCapability`/`provenance` defect (correction 1) is real but is now the
  *lesser* of the two: a turn that desyncs is moot when no turn authorizes at
  all. **`0.3.0` cannot submit any turn a node will accept.**
- **`0.3.0` disposition:** deprecate — the earlier "the front door works, a yank
  is likely unnecessary" reasoning **no longer holds**, because the front door
  does not work either. `npm deprecate @dregg/sdk@0.3.0 "signs the obsolete
  dregg-action-sig-v2 message; every signed turn is rejected by the node — use
  >=0.4.0"`. Whether to hard-`unpublish` is ember's call, but the deprecation is
  no longer optional.
- **Downstream:** anyone submitting turns (i.e. everyone). In-repo:
  `sdk-ts/extension` consumes sdk-ts **source** via a build alias, so it picks
  the fix up on rebuild; it typechecks clean against the new API and its
  `builder.sign()` call is unchanged.
- **Gate the publish on the test:** `publish-sdk-ts.yml` builds the wasm but
  **never runs `npm test`** — this is the root cause of both false claims, not a
  side note. A publish gated on a suite that never ran is a publish gated on
  nothing. Add `npm test` to the publish job (and to push/PR CI), with the wasm
  `CC` set so `pretest` can build the oracle. The Rust-verifier harness needs a
  cargo toolchain in CI (~80 s cold build; fails loud rather than skipping).

### Ordering: the flip is now unblocked from the TS side

The hybrid signer is **done and driven** (see "The hybrid PQ signer"), so
`require_pq` is no longer gated on TS work — but it *is* gated on this code being
published, since a published `0.3.0` client cannot produce a PQ half (and, as it
turns out, cannot produce an accepted turn at all). Do not flip `require_pq`
before a hybrid-capable SDK is published, or every JS/TS agent on a published
version drops offline — though on `0.3.0` specifically they are already offline.

## Verdict

`@dregg/sdk@0.3.0` builds well-shaped turns and **cannot get a single one
accepted**: it signs the obsolete `dregg-action-sig-v2` message while the node
verifies `v3`, so every signed turn is rejected on the ed25519 check. The
original "works for a fresh consumer's pay/lease/service front door" verdict
covered construction, imports, and offline shape — none of which is submission.
That is the real lesson of this file: **three revisions of verified-sounding
prose, each written against an oracle that was stale (1), then absent (2, 3)**.
The corrections did not come from re-reading the code more carefully; they came
from finally *building the oracle and running the verifier*.

At HEAD (uncommitted, unpublished) all three are closed and **driven**: the
encoder is byte-faithful incl. `provenance`; the signing message is `v3`; and
`Identity.signAction` emits a HYBRID post-quantum authorization (ed25519 +
ML-DSA-65) that is **byte-identical to the current Rust default signer** against
a freshly-built oracle and **accepted by the real `TurnExecutor::execute` at
`require_pq` both OFF and ON** — with canaries proving each gate can still fail.
The `require_pq` flip now costs TS callers nothing, on this code. Classical
stays available and explicit.

Still open: a republish is EMBER-GATED and wants the SDK overhaul, so `0.3.0`
remains the published (and broken) truth until then — deprecate it.

The "CI must run `npm test` with a buildable oracle, or this file will simply
grow a correction 4" line that stood here is **done** (see "CLASS CLOSURE"
above): `publish-sdk-ts.yml` gates on `npm test`, and the suite now carries a
second oracle that reads the protocol's Rust source at test time, so a variant
added to `Effect` fails the build instead of shipping. Correction 4, if it comes,
will have to come from somewhere this file has not already been told to look.
The wasm oracle's `sign_turn_v3` signs at nonce 0 regardless of `turn.nonce` (a
`wasm/` fidelity gap, out of scope here). No live-node round trip (no reachable
node). The legacy `@dregg/sdk/wasm` subpath's unpublished `dregg-wasm` peer
remains a separate, lower note.
