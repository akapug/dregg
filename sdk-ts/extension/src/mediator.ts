/**
 * The trusted-path **mediator** — the security heart of the front door.
 *
 * The page ASKS; the extension + user APPROVE; the key STAYS here. This object
 * holds the dregg `Identity` (via `@dregg/sdk`'s `AgentRuntime`) and is the ONLY
 * thing that ever touches key material. A page hands it a {@link TurnRequestSpec}
 * (verbs only — no key, no signature); the mediator:
 *
 *   1. builds the turn through `AgentRuntime.turn()` (the inescapable authorized
 *      builder — there is NO `Unchecked` path on this surface);
 *   2. `.sign()`s it (a real Ed25519 signature, byte-identical to the native
 *      SDK — the same `@noble` path the CLI/SDK pin to a golden vector);
 *   3. renders the faithful `explain()` reading + per-effect plain language and
 *      calls the injected `approve(view)` gate (the human in the loop);
 *   4. `.submit()`s ONLY if `approve` resolves true, and returns the `Receipt`.
 *
 * A refused or never-approved request is NEVER submitted and its signature never
 * leaves the mediator. The key is unreachable from the page by construction: it
 * lives behind `Identity`'s private seed, and nothing in the page protocol can
 * read, set, or derive it — the most a page learns is the public cell id and the
 * committed receipt.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic on purpose: the MV3 service-worker wraps this with a real
 * approval popup, and the headless test wraps it with a scripted `approve` and a
 * mock node — both exercise the identical security path.
