//! # The dreggic deployer-gate
//!
//! Anti-scam launchpads have two independent surfaces to defend:
//!
//! 1. **The mechanism** (already ours): `chain/contracts/launchpad/DreggLaunchpad.sol`
//!    makes the *contract* unruggable — disclosed supply that must close, a
//!    single one-shot mint, sealed commit→reveal, uniform-price clearing proved
//!    in Lean, a creator vesting-lock, and a solvency-floored graduated pool.
//!    The contract *cannot* rug.
//!
//! 2. **The deployer** (this crate): *who* is allowed to register a launch at
//!    all. `registerLaunch` today gates *bidders* (`ILaunchEligibility`, line
//!    274 of `DreggLaunchpad.sol`) but not the *deployer* — anyone can create a
//!    launch. The community insight (ember): "launchpads should tokengate or
//!    socially gatekeep the deployers; thousands of scam coins would disappear."
//!
//! This crate builds surface (2) the *dreggic* way — **gate the deployer
//! privately**. A deployer must present a **deploy capability**: an attenuable,
//! proof-carrying token (a real [`dregg_macaroon::Macaroon`]) that the operator
//! issues only when a **gate arm** is satisfied, and that the launchpad
//! re-checks at deploy time. The through-line the whole system is built on —
//! *"a turn = the exercise of an attenuable proof-carrying token over owned
//! state"* — is exactly this: **deploying is a turn, and the deploy capability
//! is the token.**
//!
//! ## The pluggable gate arms (the operator picks one or a combination)
//!
//! - [`GateArm::Bond`] — economic. The deployer stakes a conduct bond,
//!   slashable by the launchpad fraud-proof on a rug. Nothing to fake: a
//!   scammer must put real money at risk that they lose if they rug.
//! - [`GateArm::Interview`] — social, **the marquee**. The deployer sits a
//!   *structured interview with a hard-to-convince Claude Opus 4.8*, briefed to
//!   probe for rug-intent, vaporware, and scam-signals and to refuse to be
//!   moved by hype (see `interview/interviewer-prompt.md` + the two real runs in
//!   `interview/runs/`). A PASS issues the capability. This beats a
//!   whitelist/token-gate because a scammer cannot hype their way past a skeptic
//!   asking real questions, and it does **not doxx** — it interrogates the
//!   *project*, not the person's KYC.
//! - [`GateArm::Audit`] — the token spec cleared the dregg audit pipeline
//!   (`tools/dregg-audit`), referenced by report hash.
//!
//! ## Gate the deployer *without doxxing* (the differentiator)
//!
//! The [`GateArm::Interview`] arm carries only a **hiding commitment** to the
//! verdict (see [`private`]). The launchpad authorizes on membership of that
//! commitment in the trusted *passed-and-attested* set — it learns **only
//! "gated: true"**, never the interview content, the deployer's identity, or
//! *which* interview. A scammer cannot produce the commitment (they failed the
//! interview); an honest builder is not KYC-doxxed. The full *unlinkable* ZK
//! (a membership proof so the gate does not even see which commitment, plus a
//! zkTLS/DECO attestation that the interview happened with the *real* Opus
//! endpoint and passed) is the honestly-named weld reusing `DreggCredentialGate`
//! (on-chain) and `zkoracle-prove` (the repo's DECO/TLSNotary carrier) — see
//! [`private::zktls`].
