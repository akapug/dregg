//! # The executor substrate — the constitution face over the CANONICAL engine
//!
//! The reconciliation of the two `VoteEngine`s (the census's weld #2,
//! `docs/FINDING-chain-participation-census.md` §5): **`collective-choice`'s
//! executor-backed engine is the canonical vote substrate**, and this module
//! runs `dregg-governance`'s constitution face — proposal → committee vote →
//! 2n/3+1 threshold → auto-enact — over it.
//!
//! What each accepted vote here IS: a real ballot-cap turn on the embedded
//! verified executor. Eligibility is holding a ballot cap (minted only to an
//! electorate member); one-vote is the ballot's `WriteOnce(VOTE)` + the
//! nullifier set; the tally is `Monotonic` poll-cell slots; and the
//! constitutional threshold is an in-cell **per-option `AffineLe` gate**
//! ([`collective_choice::CollectiveChoice::open_poll_gated`]):
//! `required·RESOLVED − TALLY_APPROVE ≤ 0`, so the decision-turn itself cannot
//! commit until APPROVE reaches the constitutional `required_votes_for`
//! (the 2n/3+1 supermajority, honoring the H-rule).
//!
//! Two gates provably agree, exactly as in the in-memory face: every accepted
//! cast mirrors into the REAL distinct-voter
//! [`dregg_blocklace::constitution::VoteTracker`], and
//! [`ExecutorEnactReactor::react`] enacts only when BOTH the executor's
//! decision-turn committed AND the constitution reports the proposal passed.
//! Fail-closed below quorum: the executor refuses the decision-turn, the
//! reactor produces [`EnactOutcome::NoReaction`], nothing is enacted.
