//! # dregg-governance — governance and community are ONE primitive, on ONE engine
//!
//! ember's unifying insight, made concrete: **a federation governing itself, a
//! community poll, and a story's collective-choice are the SAME thing — a group
//! verifiably deciding what happens next over shared state.** That one primitive
//! is [`collective_choice::VoteEngine`], the **executor-backed** engine, and
//! every face in this crate is driven through it.
//!

//! ## Every gate below is an EXECUTOR gate
//!
//! - **Federation self-governance** ([`governance::FederationGovernance`], which
//!   *is* [`substrate::ExecutorGovernance`]) — the committee votes on a proposal
//!   (admit/evict a validator, amend the threshold). Eligibility is holding a
//!   ballot cap minted only to a constitutional participant; one-vote is the
//!   ballot's `WriteOnce(VOTE)` + the engine nullifier; the constitutional
//!   `required_votes_for` (2n/3+1, honoring the H-rule) is baked in as the
//!   **in-cell per-option `AffineLe` gate**, and arming `RESOLVED` must
//!   additionally EXHIBIT `required` distinct approvers through the `CountGe`
//!   gate. [`reactor::GovernanceEnactReactor`] auto-enacts on the real
//!   [`dregg_blocklace::constitution::ConstitutionManager`] only when the
//!   executor's decision-turn commits AND the constitution independently agrees.
//! - **Community polls** ([`community::CommunityPolls`]) — a general poll on the
//!   same engine: verifiable (the executor's stored monotone tally and the
//!   light-client replay agree), delegatable (liquid democracy through the
//!   **Lean-mirrored** [`dregg_intent::agent_mandate::Mandate::sub_delegate`] —
//!   the one non-amplifying lattice, reused, not re-implemented).
//!
//! ## The demoted host ballot box
//!
//! [`HostBallotBox`] (below) is **NOT** a governance substrate and no marquee
//! path runs on it. It is a host-side, in-memory causal-log derivation aid:
//! content-addressed [`VoteBlock`]s, a [`BallotLog::causal_root`], and the
//! `derive_tally`/`verify_tally` light-client recompute. It is retained for
//! exactly two reasons, both named:
//!
//! 1. the **weighted** holding-weight ballot ([`holding_weight`]) — the executor
//!    engine's `cast` bumps a tally by exactly one per ballot and takes no weight
//!    argument, so a weight-`W` ballot has no executor expression yet (see the
//!    residual note on [`holding_weight::HoldingWeightRegistry::grant_and_cast`]);
//! 2. out-of-lane consumers that still name the old shape.
//!
//! Its gates are ordinary Rust bookkeeping. Do not add a governance face to it.
