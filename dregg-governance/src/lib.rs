//! # dregg-governance — governance and community are ONE primitive
//!
//! ember's unifying insight, made concrete: **a federation governing itself, a
//! community poll, and a story's collective-choice are the SAME thing — a group
//! verifiably deciding what happens next over shared state.** This crate surfaces
//! that one primitive, the [`VoteEngine`], for two governance *faces*, and notes
//! (in code and in a shared-shape test) that it is the *identical* shape a
//! choose-your-own-adventure branch-vote uses.

//!  auto-enact (reactor.rs)       delegatable · uncensorable
//! ```
//!
//! ## What each face is
//!
//! - **Federation self-governance** ([`governance`]) — the committee votes on a
//!   proposal (admit/evict a validator, amend the threshold, amend routes). It
//!   ties directly to the REAL [`dregg_blocklace::constitution`]: the electorate
//!   is the constitution's current participant set, the threshold is the
//!   constitutional `required_votes_for` (the 2n/3+1 supermajority, honoring the
//!   H-rule), each cast mirrors into the real distinct-voter `VoteTracker`, and a
//!   [`reactor::GovernanceEnactReactor`] **auto-enacts** the proposal on the real
//!   `ConstitutionManager` the instant quorum is met. The federation governs
//!   itself, verifiably and uncensorably.
//! - **Community polls** ([`community`]) — a general poll anyone can run:
//!   verifiable (the tally is a light-client-recomputable derivation over the
//!   ballot log), delegatable (liquid democracy via non-amplifying
//!   [`community::VoteCap`] attenuation), and uncensorable (votes are content-
//!   addressed blocks in a causal log, so a dropped ballot changes the committed
//!   [`BallotLog::causal_root`] and is caught).
//!
//! ## The unification
//!
//! Both faces are the SAME [`CollectiveChoice`] object driven through the SAME
//! four [`VoteEngine`] methods. A governance proposal is a poll over
//! `{reject, approve}`; a community poll is a poll over arbitrary options; a CYOA
//! branch-vote is a poll over the story's available branches. Options differ;
//! the engine does not. See `tests/teeth.rs::same_vote_engine_drives_all_three_faces`.
//!
//! ## `VoteEngine` and the wider `collective-choice`
//!
//! The [`VoteEngine`] trait here is defined *locally* from the census shape
//! (`docs/deos/STARBRIDGE-APPS-CENSUS.md` §2, the `open_poll/cast/tally/resolve`
//! interface). It is the reconciliation surface: a future shared
//! `collective-choice` crate registers against these four methods, and the CYOA
//! runtime (`docs/deos/SPWEEN-ON-DREGG.md` §4.2) drives its branch-votes through
//! the same trait.
