//! # Proof-of-holding → governance weight, NON-CUSTODIALLY (the missing spine)
//!
//! This is the primitive named missing in `docs/FINDING-chain-participation-census.md`
//! §5.1: *"prove an account I control held ≥ W $DREGG at snapshot S on chain C, into a
//! `VoterId` binding."* It takes a consensus-proven Solana holding
//! ([`dregg_bridge::solana_holdings::ProvenHolding`]) and grants the bound dregg
//! [`VoterId`] vote weight equal to the proven balance — **without the holder moving,
//! locking, escrowing, or wrapping anything.** The tokens stay in the holder's own SPL
//! account; dregg reads a proof over that account and grants weight by proof.
//!
//! ## Why this is the dreggic (non-custodial) shape
//!
//! The lock-and-mirror path (`solana_mirror`) makes a holder surrender custody into a
//! vault to import *spendable* value. That is the WRONG mechanism for *participation*:
//! to vote, no one should have to give up custody. Here the input is a
//! [`ProvenHolding`] — a snapshot proven over the holder's OWN account via dregg's
//! Solana light client (stake-weighted ≥2/3 Ed25519 supermajority on a bank hash +
//! accounts-Merkle inclusion). Granting weight from it moves NO value, holds NO escrow,
//! and requires NO lock. It is purely proof → weight. **If a design needs the holder to
//! lock or transfer to get weight, it is wrong for this lane.**
//!
//! ## Fail-closed (the Nomad-law analog)
//!
//! Weight is granted ONLY when [`ProvenHolding::is_consensus_proven`] is true — i.e. the
//! holding is backed by a real Solana supermajority over a finalized bank hash. A
//! [`LockProofTrust::StructureOnly`](dregg_bridge::solana_trustless::LockProofTrust)
//! holding (a plain-RPC echo) grants ZERO — it is [`GrantError::NotConsensusProven`],
//! never weight. This is the same fail-closed rule the mint gate uses.
//!
//! ## The owner→voter binding
//!
//! A Solana wallet pubkey is an Ed25519 public key, and a dregg [`VoterId`] is likewise
//! an Ed25519 key. The binding is the **simplest sound one**: an Ed25519 signature *by
//! the holding's owner wallet* over a domain-separated message committing to the target
//! [`VoterId`] (see [`binding_message`]). Verifying it proves the owner authorized that
//! `VoterId` to wield the holding's weight — no registry, no trusted third party, self-
//! verifiable from the proof alone. A missing or wrong signature is
//! [`GrantError::UnboundOwner`] and grants nothing (fail closed). The binding is durable
//! (owner→voter, reusable across polls and holdings); per-poll uniqueness is enforced
//! separately by the nullifier below.
//!
//! ## Snapshot + no-double-count
//!
//! The granted weight is the balance proven **as of the finalized snapshot slot**
//! ([`ProvenHolding::slot`]) — a holding proven at slot S grants S-vintage weight, and
//! the [`WeightGrant`] carries that slot so a poll can pin an as-of-S electorate. Within
//! one poll, the same SPL token account must not grant weight twice: the
//! [`HoldingWeightRegistry`] keeps a per-`(poll, token_account)` nullifier set (the
//! consume-once, nullifier-shaped guard). Re-presenting the same account into the same
//! poll is [`GrantError::AlreadyCounted`]. A different poll, or a different token
//! account, is a distinct nullifier and is allowed.
