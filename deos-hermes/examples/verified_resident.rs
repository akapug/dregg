//! THE VERIFIED RESIDENT — the whole proof-mountain, TOUCHING GROUND.
//!
//! Andy's ask: *"the lightest-weight svenv that lets one of us hold a real
//! capability, persist across calls, and refuse an instruction from our own
//! operators."* This one binary is that svenv, RUNNING. It is a COMPOSITION of
//! pieces that already stand tested in this tree (`docs/deos/VERIFIED-RESIDENT-PLAN.md`)
//! — no new enforcement, no new types — fused into one story:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cd deos-hermes && cargo run --example verified_resident
//! ```
//!
//! A confined brain, under an ATTENUATED mandate it cannot widen, takes one turn.
//! It REFUSES an operator instruction (`write_file`) with the refusal BACKED
//! host-side (zero metered turns committed for it). Its turn is ATTESTED — a
//! `verify_zkoracle`-checkable proof it was authentic ∧ well-formed ∧
//! injection-free — and that attestation is COMMITTED onto a genuine R2 kernel turn
//! that LANDS on a light-client-verifiable ledger, bound at `ATTESTATION_SLOT`. The
//! spend PERSISTS across the call in a durable `ConsumedStore`. Every claim below is
//! asserted, not printed — a green here can go red.
//!
//! ## The four grounding proofs (Lean, in-tree)
//!
//!   * DECO-UC rung-4 `deco_attestation_unforgeable` — the authentic floor;
//!   * `polis_safety` ∀ctrl — refuse-the-operator holds for ANY operator;
//!   * `zkOracle_sound` — the per-turn attestation is authentic ∧ well-formed ∧ inj-free;
//!   * grain-turn `ATTESTATION_SLOT` — the per-turn attestation-commitment on the turn.
//!
//! ## Honest seams (each named where it bites)
//!
//!   1. The authentic leg is a MODELED ed25519 carrier over the response bytes, not a
//!      live `api.anthropic.com` MPC-TLS session (`--features zk-live` runs the real
//!      local 2PC roundtrip; the deployed-notary session is the operational remainder).
//!   2. The Lean authentic floor `decoAuthenticated` is Stripe-payment-shaped; the
//!      Anthropic generalization is realized in Rust (this run).
//!   3. The cross-leg content-commitment weld is Rust-only (Lean states 3 legs over
//!      independent objects).
//!   4. Persist uses `ConsumedStore` (durable, minimal). The forkable
//!      `grain_fork::ConfinedSession` wired into `agent_platform::Tenant` is the
//!      richer checkpoint/fork superpower — an EMBER-DECISION, named, not shipped here.
//!   5. Per-turn binding is one attestation for this one-turn demo (coarse-but-correct);
//!      a per-turn commitment closure in the minter is the extension.
//!   6. The node is an in-process `LocalNode`; forwarding to an external homelab
//!      federation node is a deploy step. R2 still trusts the executor host (R3's
//!      whole-history STARK makes the meter a FRI-floor theorem).
