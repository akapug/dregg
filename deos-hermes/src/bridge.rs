//! THE BRIDGE — a Hermes ACP tool-call becomes a cap-gated, receipted dregg turn.
//!
//! [`HermesGateway`] is the deos-side seam. It owns the grantor handle (the
//! [`AgentRuntime`](dregg_sdk::AgentRuntime) + root [`HeldToken`](dregg_sdk::HeldToken))
//! and a [`GrantRegistry`] (deos's per-kind mandate). For each Hermes
//! [`ToolKind`], it lazily ADMITS a cap-gated worker under that kind's
//! [`ToolGrant`](dregg_sdk::ToolGrant) — a real `ToolGateway` over the verified
//! executor. Every inbound [`ToolCallRequest`] is then routed through
//! [`ToolGateway::invoke`](dregg_sdk::ToolGateway::invoke):
//!
//! * ADMITTED — the metered `calls_made : c → c+1` write COMMITS through the
//!   cap-gated worker on the verified executor, yielding a real [`ToolReceipt`]
//!   (the `turn_hash` is the receipt id). deos returns [`PermissionOutcome::Allow`]
//!   to Hermes over ACP, and the call proceeds.
//! * REFUSED — `delegAdmit` returned false (scope / deadline / rate). NO turn,
//!   NO spend. deos returns [`PermissionOutcome::Reject`] naming the leg that
//!   bit — the IN-BAND refusal Hermes sees.
//!
//! The enforcement is ENTIRELY the proven `ToolGateway`'s; this module only maps
//! the ACP tool-call onto the gate and the gate's verdict back onto ACP. No new
//! policy, no new crypto, no bypass.
