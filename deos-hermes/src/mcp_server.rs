//! THE DREGG MCP SERVER — deos advertises the ONLY tools a confined Hermes may
//! use, so the model has NO path to an unconfined shell.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the deep-integration keystone)
//!
//! The live-brain bake (`docs/deos/LOG-A-HERMES-IN.md`) proved a real Claude can
//! drive the cockpit's live World — but the model was reasoning in Hermes's OWN
//! unconfined process, running Hermes's OWN built-in tools (`terminal`,
//! `write_file`, …) in that process. A benign `terminal`/`write_file` it reached
//! for never reached dregg: no sandbox, no receipt. The two confinement faces
//! (`bridge.rs` authority + `confined.rs` ambient PD) were DISJOINT from the live
//! model's tools.
//!
//! An ACP `session/new` accepts an `mcpServers` list (`acp_adapter/server.py
//! ::_register_session_mcp_servers` → `tools.mcp_tool.register_mcp_servers` →
//! the model's `tools` surface). When deos registers a dregg **stdio MCP server**
//! as the model's tool source, the dregg-confined `run_js` + `terminal` enter the
//! model's tool surface, and EVERY call the model makes to them routes to THIS
//! server — a cap-gated, receipted dregg turn (and, for `terminal`, run inside an
//! OS-sandboxed firmament PD). The model's dregg shell runs *in the container*,
//! not Hermes's process.
//!
//! EXCLUSIVITY caveat (named, not laundered): the current `hermes-acp` always
//! keeps its base `["hermes-acp"]` toolset enabled alongside the MCP servers
//! (`acp_adapter/session.py::_expand_acp_enabled_toolsets` has no ACP knob to
//! empty it). So registering this server ADDS the dregg tools rather than making
//! them the model's ONLY tools; Hermes's own `terminal`/`write_file` remain, but
//! still route through deos's `session/request_permission` authority gate
//! ([`crate::bridge`], the `live-refuse` proof) — confined at the authority face,
//! not yet PD-sandboxed. Full exclusivity is one upstream `hermes-acp` change
//! (empty base toolset over ACP). See `docs/deos/LOG-A-HERMES-IN.md`.
//!
//! ## The wire — standard MCP over stdio (ndjson JSON-RPC 2.0)
//!
//! Hermes connects with the `mcp` Python SDK's `stdio_client` + `ClientSession`,
//! so this server speaks STANDARD MCP:
//!   * `initialize` → echo the client's `protocolVersion`, advertise `tools`;
//!   * `notifications/initialized` → ack (no reply);
//!   * `tools/list` → the dregg tool surface (`run_js`, `terminal`);
//!   * `tools/call` → route the named tool through dregg confinement, returning an
//!     MCP `CallToolResult` ({ content:[{type:"text",…}], isError });
//!   * `ping` → `{}`.
//!
//! ## The tools (every one is dregg-confined)
//!
//! * **`run_js`** — the model's chosen JavaScript runs through [`RunJsTool::run`]
//!   on a deos-js engine mounted under the agent's `held` (the cap tooth, never
//!   root): a cap-gated, receipted verified turn. CROSS-PROCESS SEAM: an MCP
//!   server is a SEPARATE subprocess Hermes spawns, so it cannot share the
//!   cockpit's `Rc<RefCell<World>>`; this server's `run_js` drives its OWN
//!   embedded verified World (a real receipted turn on its own ledger). Bridging
//!   it back to the cockpit's live World is a socket the [`McpToolHost`] seam
//!   names ([`McpToolHost::with_world_bridge`]).
//! * **`terminal`** — the command execs INSIDE a confined firmament PD
//!   ([`crate::confined::launch_confined`]): file/net/exec are DENIED by the host
//!   OS sandbox (Seatbelt/seccomp+landlock), the PD's only channel is its
//!   Endpoint, and the four sandbox probes RUN inside it and report their verdict.
//!   An attempt at ambient authority (read a file outside the grant / open a
//!   socket) is physically refused. The command becomes a cap-gated receipted
//!   turn through the [`HermesGateway`]; the PD's confinement-verdict bitmask is
//!   returned so the caller can PROVE the shell ran in the container, not loose.
//!
//! The model has NO other tool path — `tools/list` returns exactly these.
