//! THE CROWN — the confined brain's turn, ATTESTED.
//!
//! A jailed brain ([`crate::host`]) is PHYSICALLY bounded: the OS jail denies ambient
//! file / exec / network, and its model-provider call rides EXACTLY the granted egress
//! socket door ([`crate::egress`]) — the *confinement* evidence a hosted run already
//! folds ([`crate::host::HostedAgentReport`]). This module makes that same turn ALSO
//! **attested**: the confined `POST /v1/messages` session (the authenticated response the
//! brain reasoned over) yields a [`ZkOracleAttestation`] proving the turn was
//!
//! ```text
//!   authentic   — a genuine Anthropic messages session (tlsn/MPC-TLS presentation);
//!   well-formed — the response body lies in the JSON context-free language (a CFG cert);
//!   injection-free — the bound field carries no `{{` handlebars-injection delimiter.
//! ```
//!
//! So a jailed LLM turn now carries BOTH proofs at once: the jail-confinement teeth AND a
//! `verify_zkoracle`-checkable attestation of the model's reasoning. That fusion —
//! *bounded AND provably reasoning from an authentic, well-formed, injection-free
//! response* — is the crown.
//!
//! ## WHAT VOUCHES FOR THE BODY — the three paths, ranked by provenance
//!
//! "Authentic" is not one thing. Leg 1 has three realizations and they are NOT
//! interchangeable; [`dregg_zkoracle_prove::AuthenticProvenance`] names which one an
//! attestation actually carries, and [`dregg_zkoracle_prove::AuthenticPolicy`] is what a
//! verifier demands of it.
//!
//! - **DEFAULT — [`AttestationCarrier::attest_turn`] (⚑ a SELF-SIGNED TEST DOUBLE).** Leg 1
//!   is the modeled ed25519 [`FixtureNotary`]: this process CONSTRUCTS the transcript and
//!   signs it with a key it holds itself, so it can mint any body it likes and every leg
//!   still goes green. It exercises the PRODUCE→VERIFY plumbing hermetically and proves
//!   **nothing whatever** about where the bytes came from. The well-formed (CFG) and
//!   injection-free legs over the bound prose ARE real on this path — the *provenance* is
//!   not. Verified with `AuthenticPolicy::AllowFixture`; **REFUSED** by
//!   `AuthenticPolicy::RequireMpcTls`.
//! - **`zk-live` — [`attest_turn_live`] (REAL TRANSPORT PROVENANCE).** A genuine MPC-TLS
//!   2PC roundtrip: a separate notary co-derives the session keys, sees no plaintext, and
//!   signs a transcript the prover cannot forge; a real `presentation.verify()` adjudicates
//!   it. The real presentation IS the authentic leg. But the endpoint is a LOCAL test
//!   server echoing a reply this process handed it — so the 2PC is real and the *model* is
//!   not.
//! - **`zk-live` — [`attest_turn_bedrock`] (REAL MODEL PROVENANCE).** The 2PC prover opens a
//!   real TLS session to `bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com`, Amazon's genuine cert
//!   chain verifies against the Mozilla roots, the request is SigV4-signed, and the bound
//!   body is **the completion Claude actually returned in-session**. This is the only path
//!   on which "provably came from the model" is literally true. Needs live network + AWS
//!   credentials (a paid call), so it is wired but not driven in CI — see
//!   [`attest_turn_bedrock`] for the exact command.
//!
//! - **THE RECEIPT FUSION (WIRED):** [`attestation_commitment`] hashes an attestation into a
//!   32-byte commitment the R2 kernel turn witnesses, so the finalized on-ledger receipt
//!   binds "driven by an attested brain" — jailed ∧ attested ∧ finalized. It fingerprints
//!   the REAL presentation and the STARK leg (v2), not just the fixture. See
//!   `grain-turn::ATTESTATION_SLOT`, `agent_platform::AgentPlatform::drive_serving_attested`
//!   / `verify_landed_attested`, and `tests/crown_attested_ledger.rs`.
//! - **Operational remainder (NAMED):** hosting the notary at a stable public address with a
//!   PUBLISHED, independently-audited pinned key and a rotation policy; and forwarding the
//!   finalized turn to an external homelab federation node. See
//!   `docs/deos/ZKORACLE-PROVER-STATUS.md`.
