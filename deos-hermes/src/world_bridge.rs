//! THE WORLD BRIDGE — the socket that lands the MCP server's `run_js` on the
//! COCKPIT'S live World.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the cross-process seam, closed)
//!
//! An MCP server is a SEPARATE subprocess Hermes spawns, so it cannot share the
//! cockpit's `Rc<RefCell<World>>` (single-threaded, non-`Send`, in-process). The
//! server's `run_js` therefore drove its OWN embedded verified World — a real
//! receipted turn, but on its own ledger, not the operator's live one.
//! `docs/deos/LOG-A-HERMES-IN.md` named the fix: `RunJsTool::run_attached_on`
//! already accepts ANY `WorldSink`, so "the wire is a socket-backed sink
//! adapter". THIS is that adapter:
//!
//!   * [`SocketWorldSink`] (client half, THIS process) — presents the exact
//!     `WorldSink` surface (`with_ledger` / `fire_effects` / `mint_open_cell`)
//!     over a Unix domain socket. Under `js-agent` it literally
//!     `impl deos_js::WorldSink`, so `run_attached_on(Box::new(sink), …)` drives
//!     the cockpit's live World from inside the MCP subprocess.
//!   * [`serve_world_bridge`] (serving half) — the cockpit process binds the
//!     socket NEXT TO its live `WorldSinkAdapter` and answers the protocol; the
//!     starbridge-v2 twin lives in `starbridge-v2/src/agent_attach.rs`
//!     (`world_bridge` submodule). The serving loop here (over [`BridgeWorld`])
//!     exists so the protocol is testable inside this crate without gpui/mozjs.
//!
//! ## The wire (the contract BOTH twins must keep, byte for byte)
//!
//! One frame = a `u32` little-endian byte length + that many bytes of
//! `serde_json`. Requests are [`BridgeRequest`], responses [`BridgeResponse`],
//! strictly one response per request, in order, over ONE client connection:
//!
//!   * `WithLedger` → `Ledger { cells }` — a SNAPSHOT of the live cells (the
//!     `Ledger` itself is not serde; the client rebuilds a local `Ledger` from
//!     the cells and runs the crawl closure over it). A witnessed read of the
//!     REAL cells at request time.
//!   * `FireEffects { agent, method, effects }` → `Fired(Result<receipt, err>)`
//!     — the host builds the turn with its OWN `World::turn` shape (nonce, fee,
//!     chain head threaded host-side) and commits it through the verified
//!     executor. The receipt hash that comes back is the REAL one on the live
//!     ledger.
//!   * `MintOpenCell { seed, funding }` → `Minted(Result<cell_id, err>)`.
//!
//! ## FAIL-CLOSED (the load-bearing property)
//!
//! A bridge-configured `run_js` NEVER silently falls back to the embedded
//! World: socket absent ⇒ [`SocketWorldSink::connect`] errs and the tool call
//! REFUSES ([`crate::McpToolHost::with_world_bridge`]); socket dying mid-run ⇒
//! the sink latches [`SocketWorldSink::is_dead`], every subsequent fire errs
//! (the JS sees the executor refusal in-band) and a crawl reads NOTHING (the
//! closure is not run — never a stale or substitute world).
