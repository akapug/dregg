//! THE HANDS THAT AUTHOR, PROVEN BY RUNNING — a confined Hermes agent AUTHORS the
//! cockpit's cards (create + edit), each a receipted, cap-gated view-patch, bounded by
//! its `held`, over-reach refused IN-BAND. The ADOS dream: the agent BUILDS the world it
//! inhabits, accountably.
//!
//! Run: `cd deos-hermes && cargo test --features js-agent --test hermes_authors_cards`
//! (the default `cargo test` is mozjs-free — the card-authoring path pulls deos-js via
//! the `js-agent` feature, like `run_js`.)
//!
//! Four things proven (the authoring sibling of `hermes_runs_js.rs`):
//!   (a) CREATE — the agent mints a fresh card from a manifest + authors its first button
//!       as a receipted patch; the new view carries the button; the gateway metered the
//!       `create_card` tool-call (the accountability turn).
//!   (b) EDIT — the agent patches an existing card's view (add a button) as a receipted
//!       patch; the `edit_card` tool-call is admitted + metered.
//!   (c) BLAME — every authored line is attributed to the AGENT'S `Author` (the agent
//!       acts as itself — the confused-deputy property, accountable).
//!   (d) OVER-REACH REFUSED — authoring a card whose `edit_authority` the agent's `held`
//!       does NOT satisfy is refused IN-BAND by the cap tooth (no patch, no receipt) —
//!       the SAME gate a human authoring goes through; the agent gets no wider authority.
//!
//! The `create_card` / `edit_card` tool-call ITSELF is admitted by the proven
//! `HermesGateway` as a scoped, rate-limited `ToolGrant` (the accountability turn); the
//! `CardEditor` mounts the agent's `held`, never root (the confinement invariant).
