//! THE REAL CONFINED AGENT — a brain-driven ACP loop through the gate.
//!
//! These tests drive the UNCHANGED [`AcpClient`] over [`HermesAgentPeer`] — the
//! peer that replaced the scripted stand-in with a real [`LlmBrain`] closed loop.
//! They prove the four things the stand-in could not:
//!
//!   1. the agent RUNS a real multi-step ACP session whose tool-calls a BRAIN
//!      decided (not a pre-written list), each one cap-gated + receipted;
//!   2. a tool-call is cap-gated — ADMITTED when granted, REFUSED in-band when
//!      outside caps — and the BRAIN ADAPTS to the refusal (it does not bang on a
//!      denied tool; it falls back to a tool it is allowed);
//!   3. an admitted tool-call drives a real World action — a committed verified
//!      turn carrying both the meter advance and the tool's effect (the receipt);
//!   4. the BYO LLM keys are CONFINED — the operator's provider secret reaches the
//!      provider and NOWHERE the agent's reach (tool args / receipts / wire /
//!      final text) travels. Proven over a mock provider; the live BYO-key path is
//!      the same brain over a real `LlmHttpCaller`.
