//! THE CROWN over the GAME NARRATOR, DRIVEN — the hosted DM narration is attested, its
//! commitment binds a real finalized turn, and a jailbroken narration is refused.
//!
//! This exercises `deos_hermes::narrator_crown` end-to-end over the REAL
//! `dregg_narrator::Narrator` (the flagship's hosted, budget-metered DM narrator) and the
//! REAL crown legs (`dregg-zkoracle-prove`'s JSON-CFG + injection-free provers), then binds
//! the attestation into a genuine `agent_platform` R2 turn that LANDS on a light-client-
//! verifiable node ledger. Four teeth, each able to FAIL:
//!
//!   1. a hosted DM narration yields a real `ZkOracleAttestation` that `verify_zkoracle`
//!      ACCEPTS (authentic ∧ well-formed ∧ injection-free), over the model's ACTUAL words;
//!   2. its `attestation_commitment` BINDS a real finalized turn — the node's chain
//!      light-client-verifies and the landed turn witnesses exactly this commitment;
//!   3. a narration reflecting a player's `{{`-injection into the DM's own output is
//!      REFUSED by the injection-free leg (the un-jailbreakability property) — while a
//!      benign narration from the SAME narrator passes (non-vacuous), and the refused turn
//!      binds NOTHING (the world is unchanged);
//!   4. a FORGED binding and a TAMPERED attestation are each distinguishable — the green
//!      above is not a vacuous accept.
//!
//! Run: `cd deos-hermes && cargo test --test crown_narrator`
