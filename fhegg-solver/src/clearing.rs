//! Uniform-price aggregation clearing — the fhEgg kernel at T=1.
//!
//! A batch uniform-price call auction is an AGGREGATION, not a matching
//! (`docs/deos/FHEGG-KERNEL.md` §0, §2). Orders fold into a price-indexed
//! supply/demand curve (a commutative-monoid fold of per-order increments =
//! a histogram + a prefix/suffix scan), and clearing is a SINGLE monotone
//! crossing of that curve. The expensive part of "private matching" (oblivious
//! sort, O(N log²N) bootstraps) never appears: the N-dependent work is O(N)
//! additions into K buckets, the crossing is O(K) and N-independent.
//!
//! This is the UNTRUSTED plaintext solver: it sees every order. Privacy is the
//! STARK-ZK/FHE stage. Correctness here is what the STARK-over-the-fold attests.
//!
//! ## The fold (FHEGG-KERNEL §2.1b)
//!
//! A limit order `(side, qty, limit ℓ)` is one curve increment. On the bid side
//! it adds `qty` to every bucket `p ≤ ℓ` (you buy at any price at or below your
//! limit); on the ask side it adds `qty` to every bucket `p ≥ ℓ` (you sell at
//! any price at or above your limit). We realise the range-add via a per-limit
//! histogram + a scan:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bid_hist[ℓ] = Σ qty over bids with limit == ℓ
//!   ask_hist[ℓ] = Σ qty over asks with limit == ℓ
//!   D(j) = Σ_{ℓ ≥ j} bid_hist[ℓ]   (SUFFIX scan — cumulative demand, non-increasing in j)
//!   S(j) = Σ_{ℓ ≤ j} ask_hist[ℓ]   (PREFIX scan — cumulative supply, non-decreasing in j)
//! ```
//!
//! ## The crossing (FHEGG-KERNEL §2.1c / §1.4)
//!
//! The uniform-price rule picks the price that MAXIMISES traded volume. At price
//! level `j` the matchable volume is `min(D(j), S(j))` (only the smaller side can
//! trade), so
//!
//! ```text
//!   p* = argmax_j min( D(j), S(j) )       (the volume-maximising clearing price)
//!   V* = min( D(p*), S(p*) )              (the cleared uniform-price volume)
//! ```
//!
//! Because `D` is non-increasing and `S` non-decreasing, `min(D, S)` is unimodal
//! (rises then falls), so its peak is the crossing. When the curves genuinely
//! cross in the interior — `∃ j. D(j) ≤ S(j)` with positive overlap — `p*`
//! coincides with the least fixed point of the monotone update
//! `F(j) = j if D(pⱼ) ≤ S(pⱼ) else min(j+1, K)` (FHEGG-KERNEL §1.4 / §2.1c). The
//! volume-max form is the robust general rule: it handles the demand- and
//! supply-dominated regimes (where one curve dominates the other across the whole
//! overlap) and the no-overlap regime (peak volume 0 ⇒ `crossed = false`) that
//! the bare `first-j-with-D≤S` operator mis-reads. Ties in the peak resolve to the
//! LOWEST price index (a deterministic convention).
