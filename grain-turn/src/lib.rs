//! # `grain-turn` — the R2 kernel-turn weld, KERNEL-facing half.
//!
//! *THE-GRAIN.md face #1 (Unfoolable), rung R2: "actions become kernel turns,
//! receipts become views" (`turn_receipt_hash` populated).*
//!
//! `dregg-agent`'s [`AgentCloud::drive_state`] is, by default, a PARALLEL universe:
//! a local [`ReplenishingMeter`], a `BTreeMap<String, String>` heap, a BLAKE3
//! `cell_root`, an ed25519 receipt chain — **no executor, no `dregg_cell::Cell`, no
//! kernel turn**. The [`GrainTurnMinter`] seam
//! ([`dregg_agent::agent::GrainTurnMinter`]) is the bridge; this crate is its ONE
//! real implementation: [`ToolGatewayMinter`] turns every admitted agent action
//! into a **genuine committed executor turn** on a real `dregg_cell::Cell` (the
//! "grain turn-cell"), and hands back that turn's `turn_hash`, which the agent run
//! loop seals into the action's [`AgentReceipt`] as its `turn_receipt_hash` — the
//! receipt becomes a typed VIEW over a real kernel transition.
//!
//! ## The grain turn-cell
//!
//! The grain turn-cell IS the [`ToolGateway`]'s cap-gated worker cell. Its slots:
//!
//! * **`calls_made`** (slot [`CALLS_MADE_SLOT`](dregg_sdk::CALLS_MADE_SLOT), = 4) — the metered turn counter the
//!   gateway advances `c → c+1` on every committed invocation, carrying the proven
//!   [`mandate_program`](dregg_sdk::ToolGateway) backstop
//!   `FieldLte { calls_made ≤ rate_limit } ∧ Monotonic { calls_made }`. This is the
//!   host-side meter: the EXECUTOR ITSELF rejects an over-rate or rolled-back
//!   counter write, even against a buggy or bypassing session loop.
//! * **`consumed`** (slot [`CONSUMED_SLOT`], = 5) — the session meter's post-draw
//!   consumed total, written as witness state on the same metered turn.
//! * **`heap_root`** (slot [`HEAP_ROOT_SLOT`], = 6) — the agent's committed cell
//!   root at the point of the call, likewise witnessed on the turn.
//! * **`action`** (slot [`ACTION_SLOT`], = 7) — [`action_commit`]`(label, cost)`,
//!   the BLAKE3 commit to WHICH action this turn was minted for and what it drew;
//!   the kernel transition itself commits to the action, so a receipt and its
//!   linked turn cannot silently disagree about what was done.
//! * the cell **nonce** — advanced by the executor on every committed turn (the
//!   anti-replay/anti-reorder link binding each turn to its predecessor's receipt).
//!
//! ## Honest scope (R2, not R3)
//!
//! R2 makes the executor's own `calls_made` caveat (`FieldLte` + `Monotonic`)
//! enforce the meter **host-side** — the meter stops being merely session-local: a
//! session loop that skipped or double-counted its local meter still cannot drive
//! the on-ledger counter past the granted ceiling, because the executor rejects the
//! turn. It still TRUSTS THE EXECUTOR HOST that committed the turn — that residual
//! is exactly what R3's whole-history STARK leg (`WHOLE_HISTORY_GAP`) removes: R2
//! makes the meter a kernel caveat, R3 makes it a FRI-floor theorem.
//!
//! The rate ceiling is set to the agent's **budget**, so `calls_made ≤ budget`
//! host-side is the call-count face of the session meter. For the flat cost-1 path
//! the two coincide exactly; for variable-cost (`Spend`) actions the on-ledger
//! `calls_made ≤ budget` is a conservative call-count backstop under the session
//! meter's value bound (the session meter remains the value ceiling).
