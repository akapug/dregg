//! The verified-Lean gate SEAM for `dregg-coord`.
//!
//! `dregg-coord` is FFI-free: it builds the wire encodings for its three verified decisions
//! (causal happened-before, 2PC decide, shared-budget resolve) and routes them through this seam,
//! never calling `dregg-lean-ffi` directly. A native node installs the Lean-backed implementation
//! once at startup (`dregg-exec-lean` provides it); a wasm / verifier-PD / pg build simply never
//! registers one, so every gate query returns `None` and the native-Rust differential sibling
//! decides — exactly the behavior the deleted `no-lean-link` feature used to compile in.
//!
//! The wire grammars are documented at the seam impl in `dregg-exec-lean`; the encode/decode logic
//! that produces / consumes them lives here in `dregg-coord` (it is pure, FFI-free).
