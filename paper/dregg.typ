#heading(level: 1, numbering: none)[Abstract]

dregg is a distributed object-capability substrate designed so that an absent
party can verify a history without re-executing it or trusting its executor. An
atomic turn exercises attenuable authority over owned state and leaves a
receipt. For histories produced with full-turn proving enabled, recursive
aggregation reduces those receipts to one root. Subject to an explicit
cryptographic and liveness floor, checking that root establishes that the
attested history preserves authorization, value conservation, and faithful
state commitment.

The model divides a cell into four substances with different disciplines:
linear value, guarded-mutable state, constructively produced authority, and
monotone evidence. Holding a capability means being able to exhibit the witness
required for an act; delegation may attenuate authority, while new authority
must be constructed from connectivity already held and disclosed by a receipt.
One predicate algebra expresses caveats, cell programs, turn preconditions, and
intent demands, and makes their coordination and disclosure costs explicit.

The Lean 4 kernel defines these transition semantics and is also the executor
the node invokes through FFI. The same verified modules emit byte-pinned circuit
descriptors. Rust interprets those descriptors but does not author their
constraint algebra, and the descriptor prover is the production proving path.
The assurance case then connects the running entry to five guarantees---
authority, conservation, integrity, freshness, and light-client
unfoolability---while pinning each theorem's axiom set and exposing every
cryptographic or liveness hypothesis.

Those hypotheses matter. The deployed FRI parameters yield a 57.98-bit density
calculation under the cited proximity bound; this is not an adversarial
soundness theorem over supplied proofs, and extraction remains an explicit
carrier. A costed extension-degree-eight configuration exceeds 120 bits under
the same calculation but is not deployed. The paper therefore separates the
mechanized transition argument, the proof-system floor, and deployment
correspondence instead of collapsing them into one claim. The same kernel spans
distributed cells and local seL4 protection domains, and factory-minted
applications reuse its receipt and theorem boundary rather than introducing a
second execution model.
