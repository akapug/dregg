= Proofs: the descriptor circuit and the light client <sec-proofs>

== The descriptor circuit

The proof system is organized so the circuit is *derived*, not hand-built. No
constraint is authored in Rust. Each kernel statement carries a *descriptor* ---
the structured form of its semantics --- from which the executor reading
(`interp`) and the circuit reading (`compile`) are both obtained, with agreement
theorems welding them: #lean("Argus.Receipt.argus_circuit_executor_receipts_agree")
is the receipt-level weld, and the per-effect statements live in
`Circuit/Argus/Effects/`. One term has two provably-agreeing readings: the turn
is a proof term, the circuit is the logic's proof checker, a receipt is a
judgment, and the chain is one growing proof object.

One proving path exists. The earlier hand-written STARK engine is deleted from
the tree; `prove_vm_descriptor2` and `verify_vm_descriptor2`
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`) are the production prove and verify entry
points, and every consumer runs them over the Lean-emitted, byte-pinned
descriptor artifacts. A coverage gap is closed by emitting from a proved Lean
module, never by authoring a constraint by hand.

The proving stack is a STARK over Plonky3 (BabyBear field, FRI) @plonky3 @fri,
with the commitment scheme of @sec-q inside the arithmetization (Poseidon2)
@poseidon2 and recursion folding receipts into the aggregate the light client
checks. The circuit layer adds exactly one assumption to the floor of the
assurance case --- the named engine-soundness carrier
#lean("EngineSound.recursive_sound") --- and no other.

== The engine carrier, quantified

The one recursion assumption has a measured strength, and the measurement reads
differently on its two sides.

The recursion apex configured for the light-client proof runs at log-blowup 6
with 19 queries and 16 bits of query grinding, over tables
floored at height $2^(16)$, so its initial evaluation domain has $2^(22)$
points. Under the batched-FRI soundness theorem of Ben-Sasson, Carmon, Ishai,
Kopparty, and Saraf (BCIKS20, the bound the deployed prover's source cites),
composed by the ethSTARK minimum rule, the parameter ledger evaluates to 57.98
bits. At the apex the commit-phase term binds, so adding queries or grinding
does not improve this particular calculation; only the evaluation-domain term
moves it. Under the successor proximity-gaps bound (BCSS25) the same parameters
evaluate to about 71 bits, but no published theorem composes that bound into a
FRI soundness statement. Neither number is presented here as an adversarial
soundness level.

What 57.98 is: an arithmetic evaluation of the published bound at the deployed
parameters, validated against the source papers' own worked examples. The
mechanized part of the ledger is a density statement over a supplied proof: the
set of folding challenges that let a far word survive a fold has bounded
cardinality, and its density in the challenge field is below $2^(-b)$ for the
ledger's reported $b$ (#lean("FriLedgerSound.ledger_perFold_error")). The
ledger's per-fold and query columns are provably independent, so no single
number summarizes a configuration
(#lean("FriLedgerSound.query_ledger_does_not_determine_perFold")). What 57.98
is not: a bound on an adversary. The metatheory's verifier is a Boolean
function of a supplied proof (#lean("FriVerifier.verifyAlgo")); no adversary
model and no grinding model appear in its statement, and the extraction
hypothesis --- everything FRI is trusted to deliver on an accepting run,
#lean("AlgoStarkSoundTransferV3.FriLdtExtractV3") --- enters the
circuit-soundness reduction as a hypothesis, not a theorem. The calculation
characterizes one necessary component of the carrier; it does not discharge
the carrier or price proof forgery against an adversary.

A configuration that reaches a conventional target is identified and priced.
At extension degree 8 over BabyBear, with log-blowup 6, 36 queries, and 16
grinding bits, the same ledger reads 122.60 bits on every shipped
configuration, leaf and apex alike, with 2.6 bits of margin over 120. Cutting
over costs a rewrite of the extension-field arithmetic in the BN254 wrap
(hand-unrolled at degree 4 across roughly 136 sites), a verifying-key re-key
across every consumer, a measured 25% more prover time, and about 20% more
proof size. The deployed configuration is degree 4; the cutover is priced, not
taken.

== Q <sec-q>

A committed turn leaves *Q* --- the receipt: the committed postcondition of the
step under one commitment scheme. State, capability lists, and aggregates alike
commit under a sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle structure. One object serves every role:
the witness proves Q, the disclosure dial projects Q, aggregation folds Q, the
light client verifies only Q-chains.

Two coupled chains record the epistemic history. The *receipt chain*, per cell
($"prev" arrow.r "hash"$), is the append-only log of what was inferred --- the
log is the truth, the database is a cache. The *witness bundle*, bound into each
receipt by its witness hash, is the content that makes the inference replayable.
Checkpoint, restore, replay, and time-travel are theorems, not features:
re-seed the execution from a recorded witness and the same receipts fall out.

== The receipt binds the whole post-state

The commitment is determined by --- and, under collision-resistance, recovers
--- every field of the post-state, including the frame the step did not touch.
Mechanized:

- #lean("Argus.Receipt.argus_commits_to_one_receipt") --- the circuit term
  commits to exactly one receipt, determined by the post-state;
- #lean("Argus.Receipt.argus_circuit_executor_receipts_agree") --- the circuit's
  receipt and the executor's receipt are the same judgment (one semantics, two
  readings);
- #lean("CommitmentCrossBind.runnable_binds_same_system_roots") --- equal
  commitment roots imply equal full state (cells _and_ rest-of-state);
- #lean("CommitmentCrossBind.chC_bad_not_bridge") --- the negative direction: a
  commitment that drops a field is rejected as a bridge, so the binding is not
  vacuous.

Freshness is part of the same object: a committed spend's nullifier was provably
fresh and a repeat fails closed _at the term level_
(#lean("noteSpendStmt_no_double_spend"), #lean("noteSpendStmt_replay_rejected")),
with non-membership itself a witnessed claim --- a sorted-tree non-membership
opening with a circuit gate (#lean("NonMembership.nonmembership_sound") /
#lean("NonMembership.nonmembership_complete")). Freshness is checked by an
opening, never by a Merkle-path scan of the whole nullifier set.

== Aggregation

Proofs fold. Each step's proof attests its own statement plus the proof before
it; the seam is pinned --- step $i$'s post-root must be step $i+1$'s pre-root
(#lean("HistoryAggregation.wellformed_attests_whole_history"),
#lean("HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_state")). Aggregating witness hashes
into one root is incremental verifiable computation @nova: the DAG of all
knowledge compressed to a single checkable claim.

Proofs are *additive attestation, not permission*. Between parties that trust
each other's execution, turns flow as signed receipts and nobody waits on a
prover. The proof layer exists so that someone who was not there --- a new node,
an auditor, a phone --- can verify the whole past at the cost of one check.

== The light-client theorem

The keystone is #lean("RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history").
A verifier that checks only `verify agg.root` --- re-witnessing nothing --- learns
that every turn in the history executed correctly, in order, and that the final
root is a genuine fold of that history. The composed guarantees of the assurance case
ride along: the whole attested history conserves
(#lean("RecursiveAggregation.attested_history_conserves")), and tampering is not
merely detectable but *unprovable* --- a reordered chain forces the binding
predicate false, so no verifying aggregate exists
(#lean("RecursiveAggregation.tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind");
#lean("RecursiveAggregation.leaf_pairing_defeats_swap") rules out re-pointing a
verifying leaf at a different step).

The realization on the executable term IR is the Argus strand
(#lean("Argus.Aggregate.argus_strand_light_client"),
#lean("Argus.Aggregate.tampered_argus_strand_rejected")), and the one recursion
obligation is the named engine-soundness carrier #lean("EngineSound.recursive_sound")
on the assumption floor of the assurance case, quantified above. This is
unfoolability made precise: a light client cannot be convinced of a history the
protocol did not actually produce.
