= The firmament: one capability across a distance <sec-firmament>

The realization of @sec-realization is a userspace service today, but its
capability model does not stop at the process boundary. The *firmament* is the
substrate that holds applications, gives them a deterministic ground to run on,
and grants them capabilities under a single abstraction whose two backings --- a
local microkernel object and a distributed cell --- are the *same* capability
seen at two points on a distance parameter. This section is that unification and
the strong properties it earns at the near end.

== One capability, a distance parameter

A firmament capability is the handle of @sec-authority --- a `(target, rights)`
pair an application holds, invokes, attenuates, or delegates --- and its target
is one of three backings. A *local* target is a microkernel kernel object (a
capability slot, an endpoint, a frame): the invocation is a syscall, revocation
is synchronous, and the rights are kernel rights. A *distributed* target is a
cell on a (possibly remote) federation: the invocation is a turn through the
executor, revocation is the group-key epoch lift of @sec-realization, and the
rights are the grant attenuation of @sec-authority. A *surface* target is a cell
rendered as a window (@sec-deos); a window *is* a capability over a cell, so it
resolves by the same executor path as a distributed target.

The application does not see which backing it holds. It holds a capability and
invokes it; the firmament routes the invocation. The unification is not a slogan
but a theorem: the attenuation decision is the same `granted ⊆ held` gate
regardless of target (#lean("Firmament.attenuate_decision_backing_agnostic")), a
widening grant is rejected at *every* backing, the surface (window-share) case
included (#lean("Firmament.no_amplification"),
#lean("Firmament.no_amplification_surface")), and a surface is provably another
point on the same distance axis as a distributed cell, resolving through the same
gate and the same verb (#lean("Firmament.surface_is_another_point_on_n"),
#lean("Firmament.surface_gate_eq_distributed")). The verbs an application uses ---
invoke, attenuate, delegate --- do not depend on the distance
(#lean("Firmament.verbs_independent_of_n")); only the *bounds* on the operations
do. The Lean development is the data-refinement obligation for a runnable bridge
crate (`sel4/dregg-firmament/`) that path-depends on the genuine cell and turn
semantics, so its local mint and its distributed delegate gate on the same
attenuation predicate the kernel proves, with both polarities witnessed.

== The single-machine principle: what collapses at n = 1

The honest bounds on a distributed capability are *distance* bounds, parametrized
by the number of machines `n` the target is spread across. The firmament is the
place where `n = 1` --- everything is on one machine --- so those bounds collapse
to strong local properties rather than weakening into a degraded special case:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto),
    align: (left, left, left),
    table.header([*operation*], [`n > 1` *(distributed)*], [`n = 1` *(firmament)*]),
    [revocation], [eventual --- the epoch lift must propagate],
      [immediate --- synchronous, dead when the call returns],
    [checkpoint], [a consistent cut across machines, possibly stale],
      [a consistent checkpoint of one domain's state, atomic],
    [commit], [quorum / finality latency], [synchronous --- one durable write],
    [agreement], [FLP-bounded, needs a round], [trivial --- one machine is its own quorum],
  ),
  caption: [The single-machine collapse. The same capability model; the distance
    parameter pinned to its minimum turns the distributed bounds into the strong
    local ones.],
)

The collapse is mechanized: the distributed bounds equal the strong-local bounds
at `n = 1` and relax above it (#lean("Firmament.distributed_collapses_at_one"),
#lean("Firmament.bounds_relax_above_one")), with the protocol-level precedent for
revocation specifically (#lean("Distributed.Revocation.single_machine_collapse")).
This is the single-machine principle made architectural: `n = 1` is not a
crippled subset but the *collapsed limit* of one model. A local deployment is a
first-class deployment, and the moment one of its programs invokes a capability
whose target lives on another machine, the same handle routes over the wire and
the program flows into distributed operation with no seam --- the same verbs, the
same receipts and proofs, only the bounds relaxing as `n` rises. The same binary
that runs at `n = 1` scales out without a rewrite, because there was only ever one
model.

== The deterministic ground

The firmament's second job is to make the applications it holds *deterministic
and reproducible* --- pure, with no hidden nondeterminism and no path to assert a
transition the kernel did not produce. The enforcement is structural rather than a
matter of application good behaviour. An application holds *only* the capabilities
the firmament minted for it, so ambient authority is absent: it cannot reach a
clock, a random source, another application's memory, a device, or the network
except through a capability handed to it, and a value like time or randomness it
does need is supplied as an *input to its turn*, recorded in the receipt, so it
enters the replayable transcript rather than as an ambient draw. Every action is a
turn through the verified executor; re-running the recorded turns from a
checkpoint reproduces the exact state, and that determinism is checked, not
trusted, because the executor is the verified entry of @sec-realization.

Checkpoint and restore are this determinism made portable. A snapshot is a
checkpoint plus an overlay --- a full state at a height cut, plus every cell
post-state committed after it --- and the recovery equation
`recover = checkpoint ⊕ overlay = replay` is a theorem for *any* cut, so where
one checkpoints is free (#lean("Distributed.CrashRecovery.recover_eq_replay")).
The integrity tooth is a claimed root carried with the snapshot and bound to the
chain's finalized commitment: the shipper never ships a snapshot whose
reconstructed root differs from its recorded root, the joiner recomputes the root
from `checkpoint ⊕ overlay` and refuses a mismatch, and a verified restore checks
the claimed root against a root it already trusts --- so a server cannot ship a
self-consistent snapshot of a *different* ledger. This is orthogonal to the
lifecycle *seal* of @sec-realization: seal pauses an application in place
(reversibly, by `unseal`); a snapshot ships its state with an unforgeable
self-attestation. A transparent move of a running application is
seal, ship, restore-verified, unseal.

== Status

The firmament is a design with a runnable core and a characterized frontier.
The local#h(0pt)$arrow.l.r$#h(0pt)distributed capability bridge runs against the
real executor (@sec-realization); the snapshot model and its root tooth are live
in the durable store; and the seL4 realization of the substrate --- the protection
domains, the on-device prover, and the boundary between them --- is the subject of
@sec-sel4, where the heart that runs the verified executor on the microkernel is
the one characterized blocker. The firmament's claims that are *theorems today*
are the capability unification, the `n = 1` collapse, and the recovery equation;
its claims that are *engineering in progress* are the executor protection domain
and the device edges, stated plainly in @sec-sel4 and @sec-limitations.
