//! Eligibility credential verification.
//!
//! Voters obtain a [`DelegatedToken`] from a known eligibility issuer (e.g., a
//! census authority, a DAO membership service). At ballot-submission time, the
//! voter forwards the envelope to the voting server; the server verifies:
//!
//! 1. The envelope's `delegator_public_key` matches a configured authority
//!    (a single `TrustedKey`, or one of several `TrustedKeys`).
//! 2. The Ed25519 signature over [`DelegatedToken::envelope_hash`] verifies
//!    under that key.
//!
//! ## Why we do not call `receive_signed_delegation`
//!
//! `AgentCipherclerk::receive_signed_delegation` requires `delegatee == cipherclerk.public_key`.
//! Eligibility credentials are addressed to the VOTER, not the server. So we
//! verify the envelope's signature directly using the same signing message that
//! `envelope_hash()` returns (which is the value that was signed at issuance).
//!
//! ## Unlinkability
//!
//! The credential's delegatee field IS the voter's public key — knowing it would
//! let an observer link votes to identities. So this module's verifier returns
//! only `Ok(())` / `Err(...)`; **callers MUST NOT persist the voter pubkey
//! alongside the ballot commitment.** See `server.rs` for how the double-vote
//! set is kept separate from the queue.
