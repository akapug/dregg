//! Ballot commitments and reveal verification.
//!
//! A ballot is `(option_index: u32, randomness: [u8; 32])`. The voter publishes
//! only the commitment during the commit phase:
//!
//! ```text
//! commit = blake3-derive("pyana-ballot-v1" || proposal_id || option_index_le || randomness)
//! ```
//!
//! and reveals the underlying `(option_index, randomness)` later. Anyone can
//! verify that a reveal matches a previously-published commitment by recomputing
//! the hash with the same domain tag.
//!
//! The domain tag, plus the randomness, ensures:
//! - Commitments hide the vote (an adversary cannot brute-force `option_index`
//!   without also guessing the 32-byte randomness — `2^{256+32}` work).
//! - Two commits from different proposals are unforgeable to each other.
