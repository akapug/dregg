//! Atomic settlement via TurnComposer.
//!
//! When an auction ends, settlement creates an atomic turn that simultaneously:
//! 1. Releases the winner's escrowed funds to the artist
//! 2. Transfers the artwork ownership capability to the winner
//!
//! This uses `TurnComposer` for multi-party atomic composition:
//! - The winner's fragment: "release my escrow to the artist"
//! - The artist's fragment: "delegate my ownership capability to the winner"
//!
//! Both fragments use `CommitmentMode::Partial` so they can be composed into
//! a single atomic turn without either party seeing the other's fragment.
//!
//! Losing bidders get refunded via `ConditionalTurn` with timeout-based auto-refund.
