//! # `dreggnet-adventure` — the Lean-native Descent, integrated.
//!
//! The run in this loop is the real
//! [`NativeDescentOffering`](dreggnet_offerings::native_descent::NativeDescentOffering):
//! its transition program is emitted from Lean and every recorded command is replayed
//! through a fresh executor before progression accepts it.  The single handoff object is
//! [`NativeDescentRun`], whose [`NativeDescentCompletion`] names the actor, exact terminal
//! journal root, settlement receipt, and banked relics.
//!
//! `NativeDescentRun` implements the shared verifier-generic completion interface, so the
//! real cheevo ledger and guild board consume its own fresh replay directly without a
//! synthetic `ugc_dregg::Completion`. The still game-specific quest and season adapters
//! ([`CompletionGatedQuest`] and [`NativeSeason`]) likewise call
//! [`NativeDescentRun::verify_crowned`] and bind their records to the exact native root.
//! [`NativeCheevoLedger`] and [`NativeGuild`] remain compatibility adapters for callers of
//! the earlier API; the main [`Adventure`] loop now crosses the shared interface.
//!
//! Party and loadout are enforced preconditions of [`Adventure::play`].  They are not yet
//! folded into the native Descent world cell: the native offering intentionally exposes no
//! external loadout commitment input.  That remaining composition seam is named rather than
//! represented as if a separate aid cell altered the Lean-native run.
