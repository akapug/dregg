# GOAL — deos as the substrate for confined, verifiable, forkable hosted agents

**Standing goal (set 2026-07-05, ember asleep → Fable works the night):**
Unify the grain and the confined-hermes hosting stacks so a hosted agent (a
jailed coding agent, or any BYO brain) IS a first-class grain: OS-jailed +
leased/metered + persisted-as-forkable-mind-cell + R2-verifiable by the renter.

North star: *rent a coding agent you can jail, budget, fork, rewind, and
cryptographically audit against the chain.*

## Current thrust
STEP 1/2 — build the confined-body grain: a `ConfinedBrain` (new crate
`grain-jail`) that plugs a jailed subprocess into the existing `AgentBrain`
seam, so the grain's body is OS-jailed with zero change to the drive path.
Design: `docs/deos/GRAIN-CONFINED-BODY.md`.

## Key grounding facts (verified at HEAD)
- The unification seam is `AgentBrain` (`dregg-agent/src/agent.rs:482`):
  `next_action(step)->Option<AgentAction>` + `observe(&ActionObservation)`.
  A jailed body plugs in as a brain — the grain drive path is unchanged.
- `deos-hermes` is a STANDALONE heavy workspace (pulls `dregg-sdk` default =
  verified Lean executor) → a main-workspace crate can't depend on it. Reuse the
  jail primitive directly: `dregg-firmament` `process-pd` = `libc`-only (cheap),
  `process-pd-sandbox` adds seccomp+landlock. That's the light path.
- `agent-host/src/isolation.rs` `JailSpec` (bwrap, Linux-only) is a 2nd backend.

## Next 3 moves
1. `grain-jail` crate: the line protocol + `ConfinedBrain` (AgentBrain impl),
   validated against a stand-in body over a pipe. No jail yet. [UNIT 1]
2. Spawn the body under firmament `process-pd[-sandbox]`; assert confinement
   teeth. [UNIT 2]
3. Drive a real `agent-platform` grain with a `ConfinedBrain` end-to-end;
   renter verifies (R2) the jailed session. [UNIT 3]

## Done-log
- Grounded the grain↔confined-body seam; wrote `docs/deos/GRAIN-CONFINED-BODY.md`.

## Open decisions for morning-ember
- (none yet)

## Honest caveats carried
- Live external Nous hermes broken in-env (`ModuleNotFoundError: acp`) → validate
  live via the Rust stand-in ACP peer / `--brain hermes` model-over-portal.
- Grain R3 whole-history STARK is a known gap (`WHOLE_HISTORY_GAP`); R2 is the
  verifiability ceiling today.
- `agent-host/src/isolation.rs` bwrap jail is built-but-unwired.
  stack name (the HTTP stack is `httpe`); a commit hook enforces this.
