//! # `dreggnet-grain` — OFFERING #2: a confined GRAIN session as an [`Offering`].
//!
//! The dungeon (`dreggnet_offerings::dungeon`) is offering #0 — a confined,
//! verifiable, paid, per-session thing on the real dregg substrate. This crate is
//! offering #2: the confined thing is a **grain** — a Sandstorm-style sandboxed app
//! running as a cap-gated *grain turn-cell* on the dregg substrate.
//!
//! ## What a grain is here, and where the sandbox is REAL
//!
//! A grain is a worker cell admitted through the REAL `grain-turn` R2 minter
//! ([`grain_turn::ToolGatewayMinter`], "THE REAL `GrainTurnMinter`"). At [`open`] the
//! executor admits the grain worker under a `ToolGrant { rate_limit: budget, .. }` —
//! the grain is **confined to exactly `budget` metered turns** under one allowlisted
//! tool id. Each [`advance`](GrainOffering::advance) drives ONE real
//! `dregg_sdk::ToolGateway::invoke` executor turn on that worker cell
//! ([`grain_turn::ToolGatewayMinter::mint_turn`]) — a genuine committed kernel
//! transition whose `turn_hash` enters the executor's committed-turn manifest, and
//! whose state witnesses the action commit ([`grain_turn::action_commit`]), the
//! consumed total, and the heap root.
//!
//! **The confinement is the executor's own caveat, not prose.** The grant installs
//! `delegAdmit`'s RATE leg (`calls_made ≤ rate_limit`) plus the cell-program
//! `FieldLte`/`Monotonic` backstop on the `calls_made` counter. When the grain has
//! spent its whole grant, the next `mint_turn` → `ToolGateway::invoke` →
//! `deleg_admit` fails the RATE leg and the **executor refuses the turn host-side** —
//! nothing commits, no receipt. Every [`advance`](GrainOffering::advance) routes
//! through the real executor, so an over-cap move is an [`Outcome::Refused`] carrying
//! the *executor's own* refusal string. **The grain cannot act beyond its granted
//! sandbox** — the jailer is the kernel. The refusal is non-vacuous: the identical
//! action lands under a larger grant (a bigger `budget`), so the refusal tracks the
//! real cap, not a hardcoded reject (see `tests/driven.rs`).
//!
//! ## The six-method shape (the same one the dungeon proves end-to-end)
//!
//! - [`open`](GrainOffering::open) — admit a fresh confined grain worker under a
//!   rate-`budget` grant (the real `ToolGatewayMinter::open`).
//! - [`actions`](GrainOffering::actions) — the one in-confinement affordance
//!   ([`TURN_ACT`]), `enabled` iff the grain still has grant left (a cap-tooth
//!   decoration; the executor is the sole referee).
//! - [`advance`](GrainOffering::advance) — drive ONE real cap-bounded grain turn:
//!   [`Outcome::Landed`] (a committed kernel turn) for an in-cap action,
//!   [`Outcome::Refused`] (the executor's over-cap refusal) for a confinement
//!   violation.
//! - [`verify`](GrainOffering::verify) — re-witness the grain's committed turn chain
//!   against the executor's manifest + the on-ledger `calls_made` counter + the
//!   on-ledger action commit (reads REAL committed kernel state, not a mirror).
//! - [`render`](GrainOffering::render) — the grain's state + affordances as a deos
//!   [`Surface`].
//! - [`price`](GrainOffering::price) — the run cost of the grain's confined compute
//!   overlay (the substrate turn itself is always free + verifiable).
//!
//! ## Honest scope — which grain, and what a fuller grain offering adds
//!
//! This hosts the **minimal real grain-turn slice**: the `grain-turn` R2 minter's
//! cap-gated worker cell, driven directly. It is a *real* confined grain (a genuine
//! admitted `dregg_cell::Cell` under a genuine executor-enforced grant), not a demo
//! `.spk` app. A **fuller grain offering** composes more of the infra this slice
//! deliberately leaves out:
//! - a real packaged grain (`sandstorm-bridge`'s signed `.spk` + `dga1_` powerbox
//!   cap rail; `grain-commons`' hatchery/fork/publish) so the grain is a *shareable,
//!   pedigreed app*, not an anonymous worker cell;
//! - the OS-jailed body (`grain-jail`'s `real-jail`: macOS Seatbelt / Linux
//!   seccomp+Landlock) so a *subprocess* brain is confined, not only the cap grant;
//! - the durable lease + settlement rail (`hosted-lease` / `hosted-durable`) so the
//!   grain survives restarts and its metered turns settle as conserved value;
//! - the R1 renter anchor + R3 whole-history STARK leg (`grain-verify`:
//!   `GrainAttestation`, `r3_verify`) so `verify` becomes tamper-evidence →
//!   unfoolability, folding each turn's rotated EffectVM leg (grain-verify's
//!   `WHOLE_HISTORY_GAP`).
//!
//! What is REAL here vs stubbed: the confined grain worker cell, the executor-driven
//! grain turn, and the over-cap refusal are REAL (kernel-enforced). The
//! `Outcome::Landed` [`TurnReceipt`] is a faithful **view** whose load-bearing field
//! — `turn_hash` — is the genuine committed turn hash from the executor's manifest;
//! the heap-root witness fed to each turn is session-derived (in a fuller offering it
//! is the agent's real committed cell root).
