//! # The games' FULL-STARK ASYNCHRONOUS LEADERBOARD
//!
//! **A played match folds to ONE succinct proof, which is submitted asynchronously to the
//! proof-carrying no-cheat board — verified there in O(1), the moves NEVER posted.**
//!
//! This is the crown made real for the two portfolio games. It adds no crypto and no game
//! rules: it is the BRIDGE between three committed things.
//!
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! ## The three legs
//!
//! 1. **A played match → foldable leaves.** [`TugMatch`] turns a real hidden-hand match (a
//!    committed [`HandTree`](dregg_multiway_tug::HandTree) + the ordered plays + the
//!    terminal win) into the membership-proven [`LeafBundle`]s the game's own Phase-3 fold
//!    consumes. [`AutomataflMatch`] turns a real board + its automaton-step turns into the
//!    game's committed D1 Custom leaves. Both land on the SAME `LeafBundle` — so both games
//!    fold through ONE path ([`prove_match`] → [`dregg_multiway_tug::fold::fold_match`] →
//!    `prove_turn_chain_recursive`).
//! 2. **The proof → the proof-carrying board.** [`match_anchor`] pins a game's
//!    [`ProofAnchor`] (the light-client VK + the genesis anchor + the **WIN** anchor);
//!    [`GameBoard::open`] publishes the game's board universe against it, and
//!    [`GameBoard::submit`] hands the proof to `ugc_dregg::Registry::submit_proof`, which
//!    verifies it in O(1) (`verify_history_bytes`), re-witnessing nothing, and ranks it. The
//!    accepted [`Entry`] stores the proof envelope + the attested publics and **no moves**.
//! 3. **The async shape.** [`ProvingService`] models the real deployment: play is
//!    interactive-fast, the fold is minutes-to-hours, so a match is ENQUEUED
//!    ([`ProvingService::enqueue`]) and proven on a background worker; the player polls
//!    ([`ProvingService::status`]) and, when the proof is [`JobStatus::Ready`], submits it.
//!    The board never waits on, and never needs, the moves.
//!
//! ## What ranks, and what is never revealed
//!
//! * A **multiway-tug** match ranks with the **hand never revealed**: each play is a
//!   Poseidon2 membership leaf whose public inputs are `[blinded_leaf, hand_root]` — the
//!   card ids are not in the proof, and the siblings are hashes.
//! * An **automatafl** match ranks with the **moves never posted**: the board transition is
//!   proven by the D1 AIR (`new == automaton_step(old)`); only the fold's endpoints and the
//!   turn count are attested.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! REAL (driven, non-vacuous): a played match of either game → the deployed recursive fold →
//! ONE `WholeChainProof` → the proof-carrying board's O(1) accept-path → a ranked entry with
//! `has_moves() == false`; a forged proof (a relabeled root) is REJECTED by the light client;
//! the anchor binds the VK + genesis + WIN root, so a proof for a different game/universe is
//! refused; the async play/prove/submit flow.
//!
//! NAMED RESIDUALS (not built here):
//! * **automatafl's full-match fold beyond D1's shape.** The folded automatafl chain is the
//!   committed D1 leaf (the automaton-step transition). The D2/D3 stages
//!   (`build_d2`/`build_d3` — player moves + conflict resolution) exist in `dregg-automatafl`
//!   and lower identically, but the *match* driven here is the D1-shaped chain.
//! * **On-device (wasm) proving.** The fold runs wherever [`ProvingService`] runs — a
//!   server-side worker here. "The moves never leave the device" needs the prover compiled to
//!   the client (wasm), which is a separate workstream.
//! * **True crypto-ZK.** The deployed STARK is *succinct*, not *hiding*. "Moves not posted"
//!   is a **data-availability** privacy property (nobody publishes them; the board never sees
//!   them), NOT a cryptographic hiding claim about the transcript.
