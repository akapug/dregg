//!   **storing no moves**.
//!
//! The multiway-tug match ranks with the HAND NEVER REVEALED (each play is a Poseidon2
//! membership leaf; the card ids are not in the proof). The automatafl match ranks with the
//! MOVES NEVER POSTED (each turn is the committed D1 board-transition leaf).
//!
//! Run:
//!   cargo test -p dreggnet-game-board --test end_to_end -- --ignored --nocapture
//!
//! Each lane BAKES its folded artifact to `tests/fixtures/<game>_match_proof.bin` (+ the anchor
//! hex), so the fast board lane then runs against the game's OWN match proof.
