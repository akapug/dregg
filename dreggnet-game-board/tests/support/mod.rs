//! Shared test support: a REAL folded whole-history proof + its true VK anchor.
//!
//! The fast board tests exercise the board's O(1) accept-path, its forgery refusal, and its
//! anchor binding. Those are properties of the PROOF-CARRYING BOARD and need a genuine
//! `WholeChainProof` — but folding one is minutes-to-hours, so the fast lane never folds.
//!
//! Source order (both are REAL artifacts of the deployed prover; neither is a stub):
//!
//! 1. `tests/fixtures/<game>_match_proof.bin` (+ `.hex`) — a proof BAKED BY THIS CRATE'S
//!    slow end-to-end lane (`--ignored`): a real PLAYED multiway-tug / automatafl match,
//!    folded. When present, the fast lane's board tests run against the game's OWN match
//!    proof.
//! 2. `../ugc-dregg/tests/fixtures/whole_history_proof.bin` (+ anchor) — the in-tree real
//!    3-turn recursive fold the proof-carrying board's own test suite drives. Used when the
//!    game fixture has not been baked on this machine. It is a genuine artifact of the same
//!    prover and the same envelope format; what it is NOT is a *game match*, which is exactly
//!    why the game-match fold is driven end-to-end in the slow lane.

#![allow(dead_code)] // each test binary uses a subset of these helpers
