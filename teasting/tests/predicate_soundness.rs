//! Predicate soundness integration test: forge attempts MUST fail.
//!
//! MIGRATED 2026-07-16 to the bridge-layer predicate API
//! (`dregg_bridge::present::{prove_predicate_for_fact, verify_predicate_proof, Predicate}`)
//! after the circuit-level API this suite used (`dregg_circuit::dsl::predicates::{prove_predicate,
//! verify_predicate, PredicateProof, ...}`) was deleted in 8cc7ef821. The comprehensive per-operator
//! coverage lives in `bridge::present::comparison_predicates_prove_and_verify_end_to_end`; this file
//! keeps the adversarial poles as an integration smoke-test on the live API:
//!   1. honest (true) statements prove AND verify,
//!   2. false statements are rejected (fail to prove, or their proof fails to verify),
//!   3. a forged public input (wrong fact commitment) is rejected.
//! All three poles are non-vacuous.
//!
//! Every pole runs under a REAL, non-zero [`Blinding`] — the deployed (unlinkable) posture. The
//! commitment is therefore not a function of the fact alone, so the verifier's expected commitment
//! is DERIVED the way a real verifier derives it: from the value it trusts, plus the blinding the
//! presentation discloses (`proof.blinding`). See [`expected_commitment`].
