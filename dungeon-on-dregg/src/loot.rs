//! # `loot` — LOOT-AS-ASSETS: a Descent reward is a real OWNED, TRANSFERABLE item
//!
//! Every other reward in this crate is a flat **stat bump** — a chest is `~ gold += 500`,
//! a committed field write on the dungeon cell that the player can never carry off the
//! run. This module makes a reward a real THING the player OWNS: a rare chest / a boss
//! drop is a **provably-fair draw** ([`dregg_dice`] over a [`procgen_dregg`]-committed
//! seed) that **mints a real [`dreggnet_asset`] item** owned by the player's own key —
//! an item they can then TRANSFER (the asset layer's cryptographic owner-gate), whose
//! **provenance is bound to the run + seed it dropped from**.
//!
//! ## The fair drop -> an owned asset
//!
//! 1. **The fair draw.** A drop is one indexed draw of a VERIFIED procgen stream
//!    ([`procgen_dregg::verified_stream`]) seeded by a committed [`CommittedSeed`] derived
//!    from the RUN's day-seed + the chest label + a sequence
//!    ([`derive_loot_seed`]). The rarity is the draw's distribution
//!    ([`rarity_of_roll`]): a [`Rarity::Legendary`] is a ~3% tail — a *provable* flex,
//!    not a claim. Because the seed is committed and the draw is a pure verified function
//!    of it, anyone re-derives the identical roll (the fairness anchor is procgen's, not
//!    ours) — a run cannot grind a favourable drop.
//! 2. **The mint.** A verified drop MINTS a [`dreggnet_asset`] note owned by the player,
//!    under a **mint seed = the drop's content commitment** ([`drop_commitment`], binding
//!    the run-seed, the loot-seed, the roll, and the rarity). The asset's content address
//!    ([`dreggnet_asset::AssetId`]) is therefore itself derived from the drop — the
//!    provenance "this legendary dropped from THAT run + seed" is baked into the item's
//!    identity, not a side note.
//! 3. **The owner-gate.** The player now holds a real asset: they can [`transfer`] it, and
//!    the asset layer's executor **signature gate** refuses a non-owner transfer
//!    cryptographically (not app bookkeeping).
//!
//! ## A forged loot claim is REFUSED
//!
//! [`LootVault::claim`] gates the mint on [`reverify_drop`]: it recomputes the loot-seed
//! from the claimed run/chest/seq (a mismatch = a run-provenance forgery), re-derives the
//! honest roll from that committed seed, and confirms the claimed roll + rarity are the
//! fair draw's. A fabricated legendary — an item claimed WITHOUT a real drop, or with a
//! roll/rarity that is not what the seed produces — fails reverify and **no asset is
//! minted** ([`LootError::Forged`]). So "loot" cannot be conjured; it must be *drawn*.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! REAL here: the fair-draw -> owned-transferable-asset mint, the run/seed-bound
//! provenance, the owner-gated transfer, and the forged-claim refusal — all DRIVEN in
//! [`mod tests`]. Reproducibility (not unpredictability) is the [`procgen_dregg`]
//! `Deterministic` property the seed leans on; supplying a real beacon day-seed (as The
//! Descent does) is where the *unpredictable-until-revealed* guarantee enters. NAMED, not
//! built: a market / inventory FRONTEND over the owned items (the asset layer names the
//! `escrow-market` swap seam), CROSS-GAME use of a dropped [`AssetId`] as a foreign
//! holding, and drop-rate tuning / set bonuses. This module is the earning primitive
//! those surfaces render.
