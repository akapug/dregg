//! # `dialogue` — real NPC ROLEPLAY on the REAL executor: an NPC you TALK to, who REMEMBERS.
//!
//! The crate's other universes are things you FIGHT / LOOT / DESCEND. This module brings the
//! missing social half — **characters you converse with** — onto the same real substrate, by
//! re-homing `attested-dm`'s PROVEN dialogue design (its `Npc` / `DialogueRule`
//! / `DialogueGrant` — "ask NPC about TOPIC", a disposition/topic model where an NPC's WORDS can
//! DO something) off its toy blake3 ledger onto `spween-dregg`'s real
//! [`WorldCell`](spween_dregg::WorldCell) / [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor),
//! exactly how [`crate::overworld`] and [`crate::progression`] re-homed the map and the character
//! sheet.
//!
//! ## The design that is re-homed (attested-dm → the real cell)
//!
//! In `attested-dm`, talking is a closed `GameAction::Use` addressed to an NPC; the world's
//! `DialogueRule` (not the AI's prose) decides what the NPC's words DO — give a
//! (world-registered) item, open a gate flag, or merely reveal a fact
//! (`DialogueGrant::GivesItem` / `OpensFlag` / `Reveals`) — and only when the rule's `requires`
//! world-condition holds. That is the whole social-level anti-forgery tooth: *a jailbroken
//! narrator that makes the NPC "press the master key into your hand" changes nothing.* The
//! `requires` condition, in `attested-dm`, is checked against its toy `WorldCell`. Here it becomes
//! a **real [`StateConstraint`] the verified executor re-checks on the turn's post-state**, and the
//! NPC's regard becomes **real committed cell state**.
//!
//! ## The NPC's memory is a real on-ledger state gate
//!
//! "The Lantern-Keeper's Vigil": the `Npc`-equivalent Keeper guards a
//! bridge you must talk your way across. The keep-scene compiles to a real world-cell whose owned
//! slots ARE the Keeper's memory of you:
//!
//! | slot            | the Keeper remembers            | tooth (executor-enforced `StateConstraint`)                 |
//! |-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `disposition`   | how warmly they regard you      | warmth GATES the friendly line ([`FieldGte`]); rise-only    |
//! | `menace`        | whether you threatened them     | [`WriteOnce`]; a goad, once made, is remembered forever     |
//! | `topic_history` | you've unlocked the lore topic  | [`WriteOnce`]; gated on warmth + never-goaded               |
//! | `topic_secret`  | you've unlocked the deep topic  | [`BoundedBy`] — cannot be raised until `topic_history` is set|
//! | `passage_open`  | the Keeper opened the way        | [`WriteOnce`]; the GRANT, gated on warmth + the secret      |
//! | `oil_given`     | the Keeper filled your flask     | [`WriteOnce`]; the item grant (a `GivesItem`, re-homed)     |
//!
//! Every dialogue turn is one real cap-bounded turn that ADVANCES this state on a committed
//! `TurnReceipt`, and every later line is GATED on it by a kernel predicate — so the NPC
//! genuinely "remembers" on-ledger:
//!
//! * a **hostile-disposition** Keeper REFUSES the friendly topic ([`FieldGte`] on `disposition`),
//!   and a **warmed** Keeper REFUSES the goad ([`FieldLte`] on `disposition`) — the friendly and
//!   hostile paths gate each other's lines;
//! * a **locked topic** cannot be raised until its prerequisite is unlocked ([`BoundedBy`]:
//!   `topic_secret` may only be set while `topic_history` is non-zero);
//! * the **dialogue grant** (the Keeper filling your flask and lifting the chain) is a real gated
//!   effect ([`FieldGte`] on warmth AND on the secret) — no flattery moves the Keeper early,
//!   because talking is narration and the world grants only what the rule permits;
//! * a **goad**, once made, is remembered ([`WriteOnce`] `menace`) and permanently closes the
//!   friendly topic ([`FieldEquals`]`(menace, 0)`) — the social memory bites across the whole
//!   conversation.
//!
//! An out-of-context / forged line (a line driven outside its gate) is a real
//! [`WorldError::Refused`](spween_dregg::WorldError) that commits NOTHING (anti-ghost), and a
//! forged conversation RECORD (a line retconned out of its gate order) fails
//! [`verify_by_replay`](spween_dregg::verify_by_replay) — the same replay tooth every universe
//! ships.
//!
//! ## The narrator-voicing hook (real, not a hard dep)
//!
//! [`keeper_line`] reads the Keeper's committed state and returns the WORLD's canonical line for a
//! topic — the granted account when the rule fires, the withheld account when it does not — plus a
//! `voiced_prompt` a narrator brain ([`crate::narrator`]) MAY expand into vivid speech. It mirrors
//! `attested-dm`'s `granted_narration` / `withheld_narration` split. It is a pure read over
//! committed cell state: the narrator can call it, but nothing here depends on the narrator (prose
//! is not power — the voiced line cannot change what the gate already decided).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! * The Keeper's memory (`disposition` / `menace` / the topic + grant flags) is REAL committed
//!   cell state; each dialogue turn is a REAL cap-bounded turn; each gate is a REAL
//!   executor-enforced `StateConstraint` — driven NON-VACUOUSLY in [`mod tests`] (each tooth is
//!   refused then admitted, one state change the only difference; it bites BOTH ways).
//! * This is a SINGLE NPC cell — one serial writer under one owner key (the same single-cell
//!   envelope the crate root's "CEILINGS" section names). A conversation with several NPCs whose
//!   dispositions cross-reference (a faction that turns cold when its ally is slighted) is the
//!   cross-cell frontier ([`crate::multicell`]'s `ObservedFieldEquals`), not this slice.
//! * The lines are a FIXED, world-authored menu (the closed typed channel `attested-dm` insists
//!   on — the NPC can only DO what a rule permits). FREEFORM player intents, and AI-DRIVEN NPC
//!   replies parsed back to a typed line via the confined brain, are the fuller-roleplay layer
//!   above: they would ride [`crate::narrator`]'s un-jailbreakable "the brain PROPOSES a typed
//!   command, the world DISPOSES" seam, choosing WHICH menu line to voice — never widening what a
//!   line can DO. FACTION REPUTATION is the multi-cell disposition graph noted above. All three are
//!   named seams over this real core, not gaps in it.
//!
//! [`FieldGte`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::FieldGte
//! [`FieldLte`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::FieldLte
