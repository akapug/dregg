//! # `overworld` — the CONNECTIVE layer: N standalone universes become ONE navigable REGION.
//!
//! Each committed universe in this crate ([`crate::deploy_keep`], [`crate::deploy_vault`],
//! [`crate::deploy_bazaar`], [`crate::deploy_crypt`], …) is an independently-verifiable dungeon on
//! the REAL `spween-dregg` executor: a move is one cap-bounded `TurnReceipt`, an illegal move is a
//! real `WorldError::Refused`, and a stranger re-verifies the whole chain by replay
//! ([`spween_dregg::verify`]). This module is the layer ABOVE them — a [`RegionMap`] of named
//! [`Loc`]ations (each a universe) joined by travel edges, opened as you honestly clear them.
//!
//! This is the salvage of `attested-dm/src/overworld.rs`'s PROVEN design (a `Region` of dungeons
//! joined by travel `Edge`s, travel gated on VERIFIED COMPLETION) RE-HOMED off attested-dm's toy
//! blake3 ledger onto the real substrate: the map is a real dregg [`RegionCell`] with real executor
//! teeth, and completing a dungeon is a real committed turn that unlocks the next.
//!
//! ## The map is a real cell; the travel gate is a real executor predicate
//!
//! A [`RegionCell`] is ONE dregg cell on an [`EmbeddedExecutor`] (the exact primitive
//! [`crate::multicell`] uses). Its owned state carries a `current_location` marker and a
//! WRITE-ONCE `cleared` flag PER location. Its installed [`CellProgram::Cases`] program gives it two
//! kinds of teeth the verified executor re-checks on every touching turn:
//!
//! * **`travel/<dest>`** — admitted IFF `cleared[prereq(dest)] >= 1` (a real
//!   [`StateConstraint::FieldGte`] on the prerequisite's cleared flag). Before the prerequisite is
//!   cleared the executor REFUSES the travel turn in-band — nothing commits (anti-ghost). This is
//!   the load-bearing tooth: **the road opens only once you have honestly cleared the way to it.**
//! * **`clear/<loc>`** — sets `cleared[loc] = 1` under a [`StateConstraint::WriteOnce`] (a cleared
//!   flag can never be un-set or re-forged to a different value). A `clear` presented under ANY
//!   OTHER method is a real executor refusal (a `Cases` program is default-deny —
//!   `NoTransitionCaseMatched` — so a flag written outside the sanctioned method fails closed). See
//!   [`RegionCell::forge_cleared`] + the driven forged-flag test.
//!
//! ## How "verified completion" is bound to the unlock — a SESSION-level binding (named)
//!
//! The `clear/<loc>` turn is fired by the offering layer ([`dreggnet_offerings`]'s
//! `OverworldOffering`) ONLY when the location's universe has been genuinely PLAYED TO A WIN and its
//! playthrough re-verifies by replay ([`reverify_win`]) — the SAME `Won + verify + replay` gate the
//! attested-dm design's `record_completion` used, now producing a real committed region-cell turn
//! instead of a `BTreeSet` insert. This binding lives at the session level (like
//! [`crate::progression`]'s XP grant, which fires a real character-cell turn only on a real landed
//! dungeon outcome). The PURIST alternative — the region cell gating `clear` on the dungeon cell's
//! finalized WIN root through a cross-cell [`StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`] (the
//! [`crate::multicell`] pattern) — needs the region cell and the dungeon `WorldCell`s to share ONE
//! executor ledger (a `WorldCell` privately owns its executor), so it is a named follow-up. What is
//! REAL here: the travel gate, the WriteOnce cleared flag, the default-deny forged-method refusal,
//! and the per-dungeon replay are all executor-enforced.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! * Region progress is the live [`RegionCell`] state in-process; the durable per-identity store is
//!   the character store's job (a named follow-up, exactly as [`crate::progression`]'s sheet is).
//! * The concrete [`deepening_ways`] region wires FOUR of the crate's universes (keep, vault,
//!   bazaar, crypt) into a hub-and-branch map; the remaining two (hold, vaulted-bazaar) plug into
//!   the same registry once their winning scripts are added.
//! * Region turns are verified by chain-linkage + each cleared dungeon's full replay; a succinct
//!   region-level replay harness is a follow-up.
