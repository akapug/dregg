//! # `combat` — a turn-based TACTICAL combat engine on the REAL dregg substrate
//!
//! Where [`crate::dice_combat`] binds ONE verifiable die roll into ONE trade-blows
//! turn, this module is the original ambition's centerpiece: a full **turn-based
//! tactical battle** — a party of heroes against a group of enemies — played out as
//! a chain of real cap-bounded [`TurnReceipt`]s on `spween-dregg`'s real
//! [`WorldCell`], every rule an executor-enforced [`StateConstraint`] tooth the
//! verified `EmbeddedExecutor` re-checks. Nothing here is a host `if`: the legality
//! of every ability is a kernel predicate, and an illegal move is a REAL
//! [`WorldError::Refused`] that commits nothing (anti-ghost).
//!
//! ## The battle is ONE cell (combatants / initiative / status as cell state)
//!
//! The whole fight lives in a single dregg cell. Its 16 register slots hold the hot
//! control + per-combatant flag state; its committed heap (`fields_map`, keys ≥ 16)
//! holds the per-combatant scalars, so the engine scales past the register budget
//! exactly as the keep's inventory does.
//!
//! | state | where | role |
//! |-------|-------|------|
//! | `active` | register | whose turn it is (the initiative pointer) |
//! | `focus_spent` / `focus_budget` | registers | the party's shared special-move resource |
//! | `dn{c}` | register (per combatant) | DOWNED flag — a defeated combatant |
//! | `gd{c}` | register (per combatant) | GUARDING status |
//! | `st{c}` | register (per combatant) | STUNNED status |
//! | `hp[c]` | heap key `100+c` | hit points |
//! | `poison[c]` | heap key `200+c` | poison stacks |
//! | `heavy_round[c]` | heap key `400+c` | the round of the last heavy strike (cooldown) |
//!
//! ## The abilities, and the executor tooth each is gated by
//!
//! Every ability is dispatched as a distinct cell method, and the compiler-shaped
//! [`CellProgram`] is default-deny: a method matching no installed case is a real
//! [`ProgramError::NoTransitionCaseMatched`] refusal. Each case carries the real teeth:
//!
//! - **attack** (a basic blow) — a real [`dregg_dice`] `d8` draw, bound into the
//!   receipt via `EmitEvent` and REPRODUCED on replay ([`reverify_draw`]). Teeth:
//!   `AllowedTransitions(active)` (act only on your turn), `UntilEvent(st{a})` (a
//!   stunned actor cannot strike), `UntilEvent(dn{a})` / `UntilEvent(dn{t})` (a downed
//!   combatant cannot act, a downed target cannot be attacked), and the HP FLOOR
//!   `HeapField(hp[t], Gte 1)` — a blow that would drop the target below 1 is REFUSED
//!   (an overkill cannot underflow the ledger).
//! - **guard** — sets `gd{a}`, a real status the teeth respect: incoming damage is
//!   reduced, and a guarding target cannot be executed (see finish).
//! - **heavy** (the special/heavy strike — heroes only) — a higher-variance `d12`
//!   draw + POISON + STUN applied to the target. Teeth add the RESOURCE cost
//!   `FieldLteField(focus_spent, focus_budget)` (an overspend is refused) and the
//!   COOLDOWN `HeapField(heavy_round[a], StrictMonotonic)` (at most once per round —
//!   the recorded round must strictly increase).
//! - **finish** (the execute) — how a combatant is defeated. Teeth: the target must be
//!   WEAKENED (`HeapField(hp[t], Lte FINISH_THRESHOLD)` — a healthy target cannot be
//!   executed), NOT already downed (`UntilEvent(dn{t})`), NOT guarding
//!   (`UntilEvent(gd{t})`), and the down is WRITE-ONCE (`WriteOnce(dn{t})`).
//! - **pass** — a stunned/held combatant yields its turn (clearing its own stun).
//! - **tick** — a round-start poison tick, floored by the same `HeapField(hp, Gte 1)`.
//!
//! ## Initiative, rounds, resolution
//!
//! Turn order is DICE-ROLLED: each combatant rolls a verifiable `d20` initiative
//! ([`initiative_order`], a pure reproducible function of the arena seed), sorted
//! high-to-low. The driver sequences whose turn is next in that order (skipping the
//! downed); the executor enforces the *invariant* — only the combatant the `active`
//! pointer names may act. A round is one full pass; the fight resolves to
//! [`Outcome::Victory`] (all enemies downed) or [`Outcome::Defeat`] (all heroes
//! downed). Each committed turn chains onto the last (`pre == prev.post`).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - **Single-cell combat state.** The whole party+enemy state is one cell (one serial
//!   writer). A truly concurrent multi-party battle (each hero its own cell/identity
//!   acting simultaneously) is the multi-cell frontier — see [`crate::multicell`] /
//!   [`crate::mud`]; it is not claimed here.
//! - **Reproducible, not unpredictable dice.** As in [`crate::dice_combat`], the draws
//!   use the `Deterministic` source: they REPRODUCE exactly on replay (which is what the
//!   receipt binding + [`reverify_draw`] demonstrate). The non-grindable `ServerVrf` /
//!   `Hybrid` sources are the named `dregg-dice` follow-up.
//! - **The balance numbers are design params.** Die sizes, HP, focus cost, the finish
//!   threshold — all tunable. What the teeth *guarantee* are the LEDGER INVARIANTS: no
//!   HP underflow, no acting out of turn, no attacking the dead, no overspending the
//!   resource, one execute per target, the cooldown, and a reproduced (un-forgeable)
//!   damage roll.
//!
//! [`TurnReceipt`]: dregg_app_framework::TurnReceipt
//! [`StateConstraint`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint
//! [`CellProgram`]: dregg_app_framework::CellProgram
//! [`ProgramError::NoTransitionCaseMatched`]: dregg_cell::program::ProgramError
