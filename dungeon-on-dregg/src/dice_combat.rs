//! # `dice_combat` — verifiable randomness bound into a REAL dungeon turn
//!
//! The single-cell keep ([`crate`] root) gives combat a FIXED rule: the trade-blows
//! move always costs 20 HP, gated by the compiler-emitted `FieldGte(hp, 1)` tooth
//! (a killing blow is refused). That is a real executor tooth, but the damage is a
//! CONSTANT — there is no roll. `dregg-dice` sits beside the crate, unused. This
//! module closes that gap: **a combat blow's damage is a real
//! [`dregg_dice::DrawStream`] draw, bound into the real [`TurnReceipt`], and
//! REPRODUCED when the world is re-verified.**
//!
//! ## The dice draw binds into the real turn — the same `EmitEvent` seam narration uses
//!
//! A blow resolves in three real steps:
//!
//! 1. **Derive the draw's context.** A [`dregg_dice::RandomnessRequest`] binds the
//!    turn's context — the world's committed pre-state ([`WorldCell::snapshot`]
//!    hashed), the action (the trade-blows method + die), the purpose
//!    (`event_kind = "combat/hit"`), the sequence, and `draw_count = 1`. Its
//!    [`EventId`](dregg_dice::EventId) is the seed's binding context: changing the
//!    pre-state, the action, the purpose, or the draw count moves the EventId, hence
//!    the seed, hence the roll — grinding those is always detectable.
//! 2. **Roll.** The [`dregg_dice::RandomnessSource`] produces evidence and a verified
//!    [`Seed`](dregg_dice::draw::Seed); a [`DrawStream`](dregg_dice::DrawStream) over
//!    that seed yields the die face ([`DrawStream::draw_die`]). The damage IS that
//!    roll — a real draw, not a constant.
//! 3. **Commit + bind.** The blow commits as ONE real cap-bounded turn on the keep
//!    world-cell (`hp -= roll`) under the trade-blows method — so the executor's
//!    `FieldGte(hp, 1)` tooth still bites (a roll that would drop HP below 1 is a
//!    REAL refusal). The draw's `[event_id ‖ transcript_commitment ‖ roll ‖ damage]`
//!    rides the SAME [`TurnReceipt`] via an [`Effect::EmitEvent`] under
//!    [`DICE_TOPIC`] — exactly the receipt-only binding `narrator` uses for the
//!    narration commitment. The event is folded into the receipt's
//!    `effects_hash`/`turn_hash`, so the roll is part of the real receipt chain, not
//!    a parallel ledger.
//!
//! ## Reproduced on replay — a forged roll is caught
//!
//! [`reverify_draw`] is the replay tooth: it re-derives the seed from the RECORDED
//! `(request, evidence)` through `dregg-dice`'s pure
//! [`RandomnessSource::seed`](dregg_dice::RandomnessSource::seed) verifier, re-derives
//! the draw, and checks the roll BOUND into the real receipt's `EmitEvent` matches. A
//! forger who rewrites the bound roll/damage (to fake a gentler blow) and re-links the
//! record is CAUGHT: the re-derived draw is the honest roll, and it no longer matches
//! the forged binding. This is a real, non-vacuous tamper tooth (driven in
//! [`mod tests`]).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - **Reproducibility, not unpredictability.** This module uses the
//!   [`Deterministic`](dregg_dice::source::Deterministic) source: the draw is a pure
//!   function of the (public) context, so it REPRODUCES exactly on replay and offline
//!   — which is what the receipt binding + replay tooth demonstrate. It provides no
//!   unpredictability on its own. `dregg-dice` HAS the non-grindable sources
//!   (`ServerVrf` LB-VRF, the `Hybrid` genesis-committed key-chain + threshold
//!   drand-BLS beacon + timeout finalization); wiring an unpredictable source's
//!   evidence into this receipt binding is a named follow-up, not this slice.
//! - **Verification is O(N) [`reverify_draw`]** — a re-derivation per bound draw. The
//!   succinct light client (a proof the whole chain verified) is a separate,
//!   Lane-D-gated workstream and is NOT claimed here.
