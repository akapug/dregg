//! # `meta` — META-PROGRESSION-ON-DEATH: a lost run ADVANCES you.
//!
//! The [`bloodgate`](crate::bloodgate) / [`progression`](crate::progression) pattern makes a
//! hardcore run genuinely LOSABLE: a reckless line strands you into a real committed DEFEAT and the
//! character's `dead` flag is set [`WriteOnce`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::WriteOnce)-final.
//! That is the STAKES. This module is the RETENTION LOOP the flagship strategy (docs Phase 2) names:
//! the Hades / FTL reframe that **democratizes permadeath** — a death is not pure loss, it ADVANCES
//! a persistent meta-progression, so "you erred, AND you progressed."
//!
//! It adds two slots to the persistent character cell (the [`progression`](crate::progression) hero
//! cell — the SAME cell that carries `xp`/`level`/`class`/`dead`), each with a real executor tooth:
//!
//! | slot | field    | tooth (executor-enforced `StateConstraint`)                              |
//! |------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 6    | `echoes` | the META-CURRENCY. Global [`Monotonic`] (only ACCRUES, never spent down); |
//! |      |          | a grant is [`StrictMonotonic`] **and** `FieldEquals(dead, 1)` — granted   |
//! |      |          | ONLY when a run has truly ended in death.                                |
//! | 7    | `boon`   | the persistent UNLOCK. Global [`WriteOnce`]; a claim is                   |
//! |      |          | `FieldGte(echoes, `[`BOON_PRICE`]`)` — bought only with enough accrued    |
//! |      |          | echoes, and set ONCE.                                                     |
//!
//! [`Monotonic`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::Monotonic
//! [`StrictMonotonic`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::StrictMonotonic
//! [`WriteOnce`]: dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint::WriteOnce
//!
//! ## The meta-currency is granted ONLY on a real death (deeper = more)
//!
//! [`grant_echoes`] is a real turn under [`GRANT_ECHOES_METHOD`] whose case carries
//! `FieldEquals(dead, 1)` (the character IS dead — a real committed death happened) **and**
//! `StrictMonotonic(echoes)` (a real positive accrual). So:
//!
//! - A grant on a LIVING character (a WON or unfinished run: `dead == 0`) fails `FieldEquals(dead, 1)`
//!   and is a REAL [`WorldError::Refused`](spween_dregg::WorldError) — a won run grants NOTHING.
//! - The amount is [`echoes_for_depth`]`(depth)` — a deeper death grants MORE. The depth is the run's
//!   real committed `depth` (the caller passes it, exactly as the earned-XP amount is run-supplied);
//!   the tooth guarantees the LEDGER invariant (echoes accrue monotonically, ONLY on a real death),
//!   not the game-balance of the curve.
//!
//! ## The unlock is bought with enough echoes, and set ONCE
//!
//! [`claim_boon`] is a real turn under [`CLAIM_BOON_METHOD`] whose case carries
//! `FieldGte(echoes, `[`BOON_PRICE`]`)` (you have ACCRUED enough) + `WriteOnce(boon)` (the unlock is
//! claimed once). A claim WITHOUT enough echoes fails the `FieldGte` and is refused. Because `echoes`
//! is monotone (never spent down), the price is an accrual THRESHOLD — a floor you reach across one
//! deep death or several shallower ones — not a balance you deplete. The claimed `boon` is real cell
//! state that PERSISTS on the character sheet, so a next run STARTS with it.
//!
//! ## Why this does not break the no-cheat leaderboard's fairness
//!
//! The boon is a MODEST, universal starting nudge (a small permanent floor-raiser / an unlocked
//! path), not a power that the board cannot normalize: the daily leaderboard re-executes each run to
//! the WIN against the SAME beacon-seeded world and ranks by turns/depth, and every player earns the
//! same boon on the same terms. A starting nudge raises the floor for everyone; it does not forge a
//! run (the run is still really played + replay-verified) nor grant an edge the ranking cannot see.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - `echoes` / `boon` are REAL committed cell state on the persistent hero cell; the grant + claim
//!   are REAL gated turns; the gates are REAL executor `StateConstraint`s (driven non-vacuously in
//!   [`mod meta_tests`]: a grant on a living character and a claim below the price are real refusals
//!   that commit nothing; a real death then funds a grant that funds a claim).
//! - The depth→echoes amount is run-supplied (the run reports its real committed depth), exactly the
//!   earned-XP model in [`progression::gain_xp`]. Binding the amount to a *replay-verified* depth
//!   (rather than a supplied one) is the same succinct-proof frontier the XP grant names.
//! - What a fuller meta-progression adds (named, not built here): a TREE of unlocks (each a
//!   `FieldGte(echoes, price_k)` + `WriteOnce(boon_k)` slot), cosmetic legacies (a fallen character's
//!   name/glyph carried into the next), and wiring the boon into a run's STARTING resources (a
//!   starting field-dressing / +HP) as a compiler-emitted seed — each additive on this same tooth.
