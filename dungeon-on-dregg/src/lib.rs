//! # `dungeon-on-dregg` — a dungeon crawl on the REAL dregg executor
//!
//! The Phase-A de-risk vertical slice of the collective-fiction rebuild. It hosts a
//! minimal dungeon (3 rooms, 1 item, 1 gated exit) on `spween-dregg`'s **real**
//! [`WorldCell`](spween_dregg::WorldCell) — the same `EmbeddedExecutor`, cell,
//! [`CellProgram`](dregg_app_framework::CellProgram) and [`TurnReceipt`] the flagship
//! substrate uses — NOT `attested-dm`'s toy `WorldCell`/blake3 ledger.
//!
//! ## The mapping (dungeon → real cell / turn / CellProgram)
//!
//! The whole dungeon is **one dregg cell**. Its owned state (`fields[16]`) carries:
//!
//! | cell slot | meaning | dungeon role |
//! |-----------|---------|--------------|
//! | [`PASSAGE_SLOT`](spween_dregg::PASSAGE_SLOT) (0) | current passage index | **the player's room** (the program counter) |
//! | `has_lantern` slot | 0/1 | **the item** — 1 once grabbed |
//! | `depth` slot | int | descent counter (a real state write on the gated turn) |
//! | `gold` slot | int | the hoard |
//!
//! A **move** is one signed action the executor admits: its `spween::Effect`s become
//! `Effect::SetField` writes on the cell and its navigation advances [`PASSAGE_SLOT`].
//! Taking the lantern is `SetField(has_lantern, 1)`; descending is `SetField(depth, +1)`
//! then the room advance. The move is a real cap-bounded turn (the driver holds a
//! `Signature` cap to the world-cell) that lands a real [`TurnReceipt`].
//!
//! ## The gate is an executor-enforced `StateConstraint` tooth (not app code)
//!
//! The compiler lowers the gated exit's condition `{ has_lantern >= 1 }` into a real
//! [`StateConstraint::FieldGte`](dregg_app_framework::StateConstraint) installed on
//! the cell as a [`CellProgram`] case, guarded by the descend move's dispatch method.
//! The verified executor re-checks that constraint on the move's **post-state**: a
//! descent with `has_lantern == 0` fails the `FieldGte` and is REFUSED in-band —
//! nothing commits, no receipt. The rule is a kernel predicate, not a client courtesy.
//!
//! This is the salvaged `attested-dm` design (`exit down -> dark_stair requires item
//! lantern`) rebuilt on the real substrate: the *content* is reused, the *substrate*
//! is spween-dregg's real cell/turn — never attested-dm's toy.
//!

// Tooth #1 is emitted by the v0 compiler itself: the attack move `~ hp -= 20` gated

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE CEILINGS — where a single cell stops, named precisely (no faking)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// How far the single-cell world honestly scales, and the two substrate boundaries a
// full collective-fiction game hits next.
//
// ── (a) The 16-register budget, and how far the HEAP carries past it ──────────────
//
// A dregg cell has 16 fixed register slots (`dregg_cell::state::STATE_SLOTS`); slot 0
// is the passage/program-counter, leaving 15 for named scalar vars. The keep uses 6
// (`depth`, `gold`, `hp`, `mana_budget`, `mana_spent`, `relic_owner`) — comfortable.
// The compiler FAILS CLOSED past the budget: a scene naming >15 vars+atoms is a
// `CompileError::TooManySlots` (compiler.rs), not a silent slot collision.
//
// Collections that would blow the 15-slot budget (a per-item inventory, a per-room
// visited-map, a per-NPC dialogue-state map) move into the HEAP: `SetField` with key
// `>= 16` routes into the cell's committed `fields_map` (`state.rs`), digested into
// `fields_root` and bound into the cell commitment. Mechanic #5 drives this: 20+ item
// keys live in one cell's heap, each executor-constrained by a `HeapField` atom
// (`WriteOnce`/`Monotonic`/`Gte`/…). A single cell therefore scales to an UNBOUNDED
// keyed collection — as far as one serial writer + one state-root honestly goes.
//
// ── (b) CEILING 1 — the MULTI-CELL boundary (concurrency & authority, not capacity) ─
//
// The heap removes the CAPACITY reason to split, so the real boundary is not "ran out
// of slots" — it is CONCURRENCY and AUTHORITY. One cell is ONE serial writer under ONE
// owner key: every turn touching it totally orders against every other. A two-player
// party that acts SIMULTANEOUSLY, a shared world edited by many authors at once, or
// per-player state each player must solely control, all force a cell PER agent/party/
// shard — because independent writers must not serialize on one cell (`BalanceDeltaLte`
// is even flagged NOT i-confluent for exactly this reason in the constraint docs). The
// keep is single-writer, so it stays one cell; the moment two parties act concurrently,
// the world is a GRAPH of cells (a player-cell, a room-cell, a party-cell), not one.
//
// ── (c) CEILING 2 — CROSS-CELL gating (a tooth reading ANOTHER cell's state) ───────
//
// Every tooth here (`FieldGte`, `WriteOnce`, `Monotonic`, `FieldLteField`, `HeapField`)
// is checked against the ACTION'S OWN TARGET CELL's (old,new) post-state. None can read
// a DIFFERENT cell. So a rule like "room B's door opens because item A — living on a
// SEPARATE cell — was taken" CANNOT be a `StateConstraint` on room B's cell: room B's
// program cannot see item A's cell. Once (b) splits the world into multiple cells, most
// interesting gates become cross-cell and fall off this vocabulary's edge.
//
// What the cross-cell primitive needs (it EXISTS in the substrate; this slice does not
// wire it): a witnessed observation of a peer cell's FINALIZED field. The vocabulary
// already names it — `StateConstraint::Witnessed` / the `BoundBranch::Witnessed`
// arm / `ObservedFieldEquals` (types.rs), gated by a host `FinalizedRootAuthority`
// (`WitnessBundle::finalized_roots`): the turn carries a Merkle-open proof that peer
// cell A's `source_field` opens to value `v` at a finalized `at_root`, and the local
// tooth admits iff `new[local] == v`. A missing authority FAILS CLOSED (no peer roots ⇒
// every cross-cell read refuses) — the anti-self-fabrication tooth. Wiring it needs
// three things this slice lacks: (1) a real finalized-root channel between the world's
// cells (the `FinalizedRootAuthority` host impl), (2) the compiler lowering a
// cross-room condition (`taken(item_A) in room_B`) to a `Witnessed`/`ObservedFieldEquals`
// against item A's cell + slot, and (3) the driver attaching the Merkle-open witness
// blob to the gated turn. That is the next Phase — the multi-cell collective fiction —
// and it is a WIRING task over an existing primitive, not a missing one.

//
// The Keep proved four rules-as-teeth on ONE scene. The Vault is a SECOND committed
// world, deployed the SAME real way (compile → augment → birth cell → install the
// `CellProgram`), whose deepening is an **inventory**: items a player picks up and uses,
// each pickup/use a real cap-bounded turn the verified executor REFUSES when illegal.
// Nothing here is app bookkeeping — every rule is a `StateConstraint` the
// [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor) re-checks on the turn's
// post-state, identical enforcement to the Keep.
//
// | item             | pickup tooth (augmented)      | use tooth                                  |
// |------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
// | coral key        | `WriteOnce { key_owner }`     | `FieldGte(key_owner, 1)` on the grate move |
// | healing draught  | `WriteOnce { draughts_held }` | `FieldLteField(draughts_drunk ≤ held)`     |
//
// Plus the Keep's HP-floor combat (a compiler-emitted `FieldGte(hp, 1)` on the
// eel-warden blow), so the draught's heal is load-bearing. Each tooth is
// executor-enforced and NON-VACUOUS — it BITES on the illegal move:
//   * **grab-a-taken-item** — the coral key is a CONTESTED relic: the first crew to
//     claim it (`key_owner` 0→1) holds it, and a RIVAL claim (1→2) fails `WriteOnce`.
//     (A boolean `WriteOnce` admits an idempotent `1→1` no-op — "you already hold it" —
//     so a genuinely-biting pickup refusal is the rival-claim / first-grabber shape,
//     a nonzero→different-nonzero write, exactly what `WriteOnce` refuses.)
//   * **use-without-holding (a gate item)** — slipping the grate with `key_owner == 0`
//     fails the `FieldGte(key_owner, 1)` the compiler lifts from `{ key_owner >= 1 }`
//     (the grate move does not touch `key_owner`, so the threshold stays 1 — a real
//     bite, not the vacuous `>= 0` a same-var decrement would collapse to). The coral
//     key is therefore BOTH loot (WriteOnce) AND a key that gates a door (FieldGte) —
//     one inventory item carrying two distinct executor teeth.
//   * **use-without-holding (a consumable)** — drinking with `draughts_held == 0`, or
//     over-drinking past what you hold, fails the cross-slot `FieldLteField` budget
//     (drunk 0→1 with held 0 ⇒ 1 ≤ 0 is false ⇒ refused; drunk 1→2 with held 1 likewise).
//
// The Vault reuses the SAME augmentation machinery as the Keep ([`keep_slot`],
// [`augment_case`]) and the SAME real substrate — it is a fully additive world.

/// The second dungeon — "The Sunken Vault" — in the spween DSL. Three rooms: a drowned

=== wreck

~ hp = 40

A drowned wreck slumps in the current. A coral key glints in the silt — both the Gull
and Kraken wrecking-crews reach for it, and only the first hand to close on it holds it.
A healing draught bobs sealed in a bubble of air. A flooded gallery yawns north.

* [Claim the coral key for the Gull crew]
  ~ key_owner = 1
  -> wreck

* [Claim the coral key for the Kraken crew]
  ~ key_owner = 2
  -> wreck

* [Pocket the healing draught]
  ~ draughts_held = 1
  -> wreck

* [Swim north into the gallery]
  -> gallery

=== gallery

An eel-warden coils before a barnacled grate. Its bite is quick and cold, and the grate
beyond will not shift for a hand without the coral key.

* [Trade a blow with the eel-warden] { hp >= 16 }
  ~ hp -= 15
  -> gallery

* [Drink the healing draught]
  ~ draughts_drunk += 1
  ~ hp += 25
  -> gallery

* [Slip through the barnacled grate] { key_owner >= 1 }
  -> vault

* [Retreat to the wreck]
  -> wreck

=== vault

The vault floods with pale green light. A drowned hoard heaps the silt floor.

* [Seize the drowned hoard]

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A THIRD UNIVERSE — "The Tidewrack Hold": a GENERAL N-SLOT HEAP-KEYED INVENTORY
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Keep proved a heap-keyed `WriteOnce` on ONE key (mechanic #5); the Sunken Vault
// gave each item its OWN NAMED REGISTER SLOT (`key_owner`, `draughts_held`,
// `draughts_drunk`) — at most ~15 items before the 16-register budget runs out. The
// Tidewrack Hold is the fuller version the Vault named: items live in a HEAP-KEYED SLOT
// MAP (`CellState::fields_map`, keys `>= STATE_SLOTS`), NOT one register per item, so a
// player holds an UNBOUNDED set of distinct items. Every operation is a real cap-bounded
// turn the verified [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor) refers,
// each tooth a real [`StateConstraint`] the executor re-checks on the turn's post-state —
// never app bookkeeping, identical enforcement to the Keep/Vault.
//
// THE MODEL — `heap[held_key] = owner id` (0 / absent = unheld); one heap key per item:
//
//   * PICKUP (insert) — a SINGLE generic [`HOLD_PICKUP_METHOD`] turn whose case is a
//     CONJUNCTION of `HeapField { key, WriteOnce }` over EVERY registered item key.
//     Writing item K (absent/zero → owner) admits; a RIVAL re-grab of a TAKEN key
//     (owner_a → owner_b) fails K's `WriteOnce`; every UNTOUCHED key's `WriteOnce` passes
//     idempotently (old == new), so ONE method safely gates N distinct inserts. A
//     double-grab of the same heap key by a rival is a real executor refusal.
//   * USE (a gate / key item) — a per-item `hold_use_<key>` turn gated
//     `HeapField { key, Gte(1) }`: admitted IFF the item is held (absent post-state ⇒
//     refuse), and NON-consuming (the held key is untouched; a benign use-tally heap key
//     bumps so the turn carries a real committed effect and repeat-uses are visible).
//     Use-without-holding is a real `WorldError::Refused`.
//   * CONSUME (a charged item) — a per-item `hold_consume_<key>` turn gated by TWO teeth:
//     `HeapField { held_key, Gte(1) }` (must hold it — absent refuses: use-without-
//     holding on a consumable) AND `HeapField { used_key, Lte(charges) }` (the consumed
//     tally may never exceed the item's charge cap). A single-charge item consumed twice
//     (used 1 → 2 > 1) is refused: a consumed item cannot be re-used.
//
// Replay: the inventory turns ride [`WorldCell::apply_raw`] (the heap path, below the
// choice/passage layer), so their verify-by-replay is the RAW-TURN analog of
// [`spween_dregg::verify_by_replay`] (which replays register-slot CHOICE playthroughs):
// [`replay_hold`] re-deploys an identically-seeded Hold and re-applies the SAME op
// sequence, reproducing the committed heap exactly; a retconned record (a use whose
// pickup was dropped) is REFUSED by the real executor on replay. The room-scene half of
// this universe still re-verifies through the stock [`spween_dregg::verify`] machinery
// unchanged (see `hold_tests::hold_room_playthrough_reverifies`).
//
// HONEST SCOPE. This is a general HEAP-KEYED inventory with executor teeth for
// pickup / use / consume over an unbounded key space. What a FULLER version adds:
//   * true QUANTITIES / STACKING — held as a live count a consume DECREMENTS with a
//     dynamic `consumed <= held` budget. The heap vocabulary is SINGLE-KEY atoms
//     (`Gte`/`Lte`/`WriteOnce`/`Monotonic`/…) with NO heap-vs-heap cross-key `Lte`, so
//     the consume cap here is a per-item COMPILE-TIME constant, not the live held count
//     (the Vault's cross-SLOT `FieldLteField` has no heap twin);
//   * DROP / transfer — heap `WriteOnce` freezes a taken key against erasure (the anti-
//     double-grab tooth), so a droppable/tradeable item needs a non-`WriteOnce` owner
//     atom plus a sender-bound `AnyOf[HeapField, SenderIs]` transfer gate (the vocabulary
//     exists; this slice does not wire it);
//   * MULTIPLAYER-CONCURRENT holding — one cell is one serial writer (the multi-cell
//     ceiling this crate already names): concurrent independent inventories are a cell
//     per player. The rival-refused tooth here is first-grabber-wins on ONE cell.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A FOURTH UNIVERSE — "The Merchant's Bazaar": an ECONOMY (buy / sell) + QUANTITIES
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Keep proved rules-as-teeth; the Sunken Vault proved item pickup/use; the
// Tidewrack Hold proved an unbounded heap-keyed inventory. The Bazaar deepens all
// three with the mechanic they all lacked: **an economy** — a shop where a purse of
// gold BUYS goods and goods SELL back for gold, and where an item is held in a real
// QUANTITY that a use DECREMENTS to zero. Every rule below is a real
// [`StateConstraint`] the verified [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor)
// re-checks on the turn's post-state — never app bookkeeping, identical enforcement
// to the three worlds before it.
//
// ── THE PROBLEM AN ECONOMY POSES (and why the obvious gate is VACUOUS) ────────────
//
// The natural shop rule is "you cannot buy what you cannot afford" — pre-state
// `gold >= price`. But every tooth here is a POST-state predicate, and the compiler
// lifts a pre-condition through the move's own net delta
// (`compare_constraint`: `pre >= base` ⟺ `post >= base + d`). A purchase's delta is
// exactly `−price`, so `{ gold >= 50 } ~ gold -= 50` lifts to `FieldGte(gold, 0)` —
// **VACUOUS**: an unsigned slot is always `>= 0`. Worse, [`WorldCell::apply_choice`]
// CLAMPS a Modify at zero (`(cur + delta).max(0)`), so a broke player's purchase would
// commit with the purse silently clamped to 0 and the goods delivered. A `FieldGte`
// gold gate on the paying move itself is NOT a balance tooth; it is a no-op.
//
// ── THE REAL BALANCE TOOTH: `StateConstraint::FieldDelta` (EXACT PAYMENT) ─────────
//
// The atom that bites is the exact-delta transition predicate
// [`StateConstraint::FieldDelta`] — `new[gold] == old[gold] + delta` over the u64
// lane (`field_add`, wrapping). Install `FieldDelta { gold, −price }` on the buy case:
//
//   * AFFORDABLE (`gold = 120`, price 50): the driver writes `120 − 50 = 70`; the tooth
//     recomputes `120 + (2^64 − 50) mod 2^64 = 70` — ADMITTED, and the item lands on
//     the SAME turn (one action, all-or-nothing).
//   * BROKE (`gold = 30`, price 50): the clamp writes `0`; the tooth recomputes
//     `30 − 50 mod 2^64` (a huge value) `≠ 0` — **REFUSED**. Nothing commits: no goods,
//     no gold movement (anti-ghost). The underflow the clamp would have swallowed is
//     exactly what the kernel predicate catches.
//   * FORGED (a raw turn paying less, or a sale minting `gold = 9999`): the post-state
//     is not `old ± price` — REFUSED. The price schedule is the kernel's, not the
//     client's: no underpaying, no ghost-minting.
//
// Boundary: spending your LAST coin (`gold == price`) commits exactly (`new == 0 ==
// old − price`) — the tooth is exact, not a "keep one coin" hack.
//
// ── QUANTITIES (a held-count a use DECREMENTS, and the floor at zero) ─────────────
//
// The same atom is the sound DECREMENT gate. A held count lives in a register slot;
// a use writes `held − 1` under `FieldDelta { held, −1 }`. With `held == 0` the clamp
// writes `0`, the tooth expects `0 − 1 mod 2^64` — REFUSED. So a quantity walks
// `3 → 2 → 1 → 0` on real committed turns and the next use is a REAL executor refusal:
// "the count hits zero and the stack is spent." The Hold's `Gte(1)`/`Lte(cap)` heap
// pair models a use-TALLY against a compile-time cap; `FieldDelta` models the LIVE
// held count itself — the two are complementary, and the Bazaar drives both shapes
// (`FieldLte` caps the merchant's STOCK; `FieldDelta` decrements the player's STACK).
//
// ── THE FULL TOOTH TABLE (every rule a kernel predicate) ─────────────────────────
//
// | move (method)              | executor teeth                                                              |
// |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
// | buy potion (50g)           | `FieldDelta{gold,−50}` + `FieldDelta{potions,+1}` + `FieldLte{potions_bought,2}` (merchant STOCK) + `Monotonic{potions_bought}` (no forged restock) |
// | buy torch bundle (30g, ×3) | `FieldDelta{gold,−30}` + `FieldDelta{torches,+3}` (exact bundle)             |
// | sell amulet (+120g)        | `FieldDelta{amulet,−1}` (must HOLD it: 0 ⇒ refused) + `FieldDelta{gold,+120}` (exact price, no mint) |
// | enter the counting room    | `FieldGte{gold,100}` (compiler-emitted; the move does NOT touch gold, so the threshold stands — a genuine solvency gate) |
// | rob the niche              | `FieldLte{niches_robbed,1}` (the niche holds ONE amulet) + `Monotonic{niches_robbed}` + `FieldDelta{amulet,+1}` |
// | drink a potion             | `FieldDelta{potions,−1}` (quantity decrement; 0 ⇒ refused) + `FieldDelta{hp,+25}` (exact heal) |
// | light a torch              | `FieldDelta{torches,−1}` (quantity decrement) + `Monotonic{wards_lit}`       |
// | trade a blow               | `FieldGte{hp,1}` (compiler-emitted HP floor — a killing blow is refused)     |
// | seize the takings          | `FieldDelta{gold,+500}` (exact hoard)                                        |
//
// ── HONEST SCOPE — gold is a COUNTER, not a conserved `Effect::Transfer` ──────────
//
// dregg HAS a conserved value move — [`dregg_app_framework::Effect::Transfer`], which
// debits `from` and credits `to` atomically and REFUSES a source that would go below
// zero (`TurnError::InsufficientBalance`, `turn/src/executor/apply.rs`). It is NOT
// usable as this game's gold, and the reason is DRIVEN, not asserted, in
// [`bazaar_tests::conserved_transfer_is_out_of_reach_gold_is_a_counter`]:
//
//   * the value it moves is **computrons** — the substrate's fee/resource currency
//     (every turn burns `fee = 10_000` from the agent cell), so game gold would be
//     spent by the act of playing;
//   * the world-cell is born with **balance 0** and `Effect::CreateCell` REFUSES a
//     nonzero balance (`CreateCellNonZeroBalance` — no minting), so a Transfer out of
//     the world-cell is refused for insufficient balance (the test drives exactly this);
//   * `spween-dregg` exposes cell FIELDS ([`WorldCell::seed_var`]), not cell BALANCES —
//     nothing in this crate's reach can fund a purse of computrons;
//   * and a real merchant would be a SECOND cell — the multi-cell ceiling this crate
//     already names (one cell is one serial writer).
//
// So the Bazaar's gold is a **counter with an exact-delta kernel tooth**: sound against
// underflow, underpayment and minting WITHIN this cell's serialized history, but not
// globally conserved (the niche's amulet and the counting-room hoard are created; the
// merchant's payments are not debited from a merchant's purse). A conserved-Transfer
// economy is a real, reachable NEXT rung — it needs a merchant CELL funded through the
// substrate's issuance path plus the cross-cell `Send` permission, i.e. the multi-cell
// universe, not this one.
//
// What a FULLER economy adds beyond this slice:
//   * **multi-item baskets** — one turn buying N distinct goods at once. Reachable
//     TODAY (a case's constraints are a conjunction: one `FieldDelta` per good + one
//     for the summed price), but the v0 scene compiler has no basket syntax; it would
//     be an augmented raw-turn method like the Hold's `hold_pickup`.
//   * **dynamic pricing** (supply/demand, haggling) — `FieldDelta` pins ONE price per
//     case, so a price that MOVES needs either a case per price point or a cross-slot
//     "pay at least the posted price" atom. The vocabulary's [`StateConstraint::FieldLteOther`]
//     (`new[a] <= new[b] + delta`) can express "the purse fell by at least the posted
//     price slot" — a real closure lane, not a hole.
//   * **cross-player trade** — two purses on two cells: cross-cell, hence the
//     `Witnessed`/`ObservedFieldEquals` machinery the [`multicell`] module already
//     wires, or a conserved `Effect::Transfer` between player cells.
//
// ── NAMED ATOM GAP (nothing added to the core; designed around) ───────────────────
//
// The heap vocabulary ([`HeapAtom`]) has NO exact-delta twin (`Equals`/`Gte`/`Lte`/
// `WriteOnce`/`Monotonic`/`StrictMonotonic`/`MemberOf`/`InRangeTwoSided`/`DeltaBounded`
// — `DeltaBounded` bounds |Δ| but does not PIN it, so it cannot refuse a broke
// purchase's clamped write). A heap-keyed quantity therefore CANNOT carry the
// exact-payment/exact-decrement tooth that makes this economy sound; the Bazaar's
// purse and stacks live in REGISTER slots for exactly that reason (8 of the 15 usable
// slots). The gap is `HeapAtom::Delta { d: i64 }` (the heap twin of
// `StateConstraint::FieldDelta`) — plus a heap cross-key `Lte` for a live
// `consumed <= held` bound, which the Hold already named. Both belong in
// `cell/src/program/` (+ the Lean twin + the AIR), which is OUT OF SCOPE here; the
// Bazaar is built entirely from atoms that already exist.

/// The fourth dungeon — "The Merchant's Bazaar" — in the spween DSL. Three rooms: the
/// `bazaar` (the shop: buy potions/torches, sell the amulet, pay into the counting
/// room), the `ossuary` (rob the niche, fight the warden, and SPEND the goods —
/// quantities decrementing to zero), and the `counting_room` (the takings). The
/// economy RULES lower to real executor teeth (see [`bazaar_compiled`]).

// **without tripping the alarm**. Every rule below is a real [`StateConstraint`] the
// verified [`EmbeddedExecutor`](dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor) re-checks on the
// turn's post-state — never app bookkeeping, identical enforcement to the four before it.
//
// ── THE MODEL — `alert` (a register slot), two thresholds, three tooth-shapes ──────
//
//   * NOISE (a guarded step) — the noisy move `~ alert += FORCE_NOISE` carries TWO
//     augmented teeth: an EXACT [`StateConstraint::FieldDelta`]`{alert, +FORCE_NOISE}`
//     (the noise it makes is the kernel's, un-forgeable to `+0`) AND a hard-ceiling
//     [`StateConstraint::FieldLte`]`{alert, ALERT_CAP}`. A force that would push `alert`
//     PAST the cap (`post > ALERT_CAP`) is a REAL `WorldError::Refused` — "one more sound
//     and the sentinels swarm." This is the guarded step the stealth puzzle turns on.
//   * HUSH (the distraction) — `~ alert -= HUSH` carries an EXACT
//     `FieldDelta{alert, −HUSH}`: it LOWERS `alert` by exactly `HUSH` on a real committed
//     turn (un-forgeable to a bigger drop; and with `alert < HUSH` the clamp-at-zero write
//     is not `old − HUSH` ⇒ refused: you cannot quiet an alarm that was never raised).
//     A hush re-enables a force the cap had refused, and re-opens the alert-gated door.
//   * THE OBJECTIVE DOOR — `{ alert <= SANCTUM_ALERT && cage_open >= 1 }` is a
//     compiler-emitted CONJUNCTION (the move touches neither var, so both thresholds
//     survive the net-delta lift NON-VACUOUSLY): a `FieldLte{alert, SANCTUM_ALERT}`
//     solvency-style gate on the alarm AND a `FieldGte{cage_open, 1}` requirement that
//     the reliquary cage was forced first. Slipping into the sanctum LOUD (`alert >
//     SANCTUM_ALERT`) is a REAL executor refusal — the alarm is the kernel's referee.
//
// THE PUZZLE. The only way in is through the reliquary cage, and forcing it is NOISY
// (`cage_open` needs a `force`, which raises `alert` past the door's `SANCTUM_ALERT`
// threshold). So the sound solution is FORCE (make the needed noise) → HUSH (quiet back
// down) → EASE the door open while silent — the "reach the vault without tripping the
// alarm" playthrough. Being greedy with noise trips the hard cap; the door stays shut
// until you have hushed back under the threshold.
//
// ── RE-ENTRY (the Bazaar's lesson, applied) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `alert` is NEVER seeded — an unset register slot reads 0, which is exactly the "silent"
// start, so there is no genesis entry effect to re-run. And the stealth room (`nave`)
// carries NO entry effects: the force/hush/creep moves all loop `-> nave`, and a re-entry
// re-runs a passage's entry effects (the behaviour the Bazaar lane found), so a room that
// SEEDED `alert` and looped to itself would CLEANSE the alarm every turn. The Crypt sidesteps
// this by construction: `alert` has no seed to re-run, and `nave` has nothing to cleanse.
//
// ── HONEST SCOPE — what this stealth model is, and what a FULLER one adds ──────────
//
// This is a single global `alert` scalar with an executor-refereed raise/lower/cap and an
// alert-gated objective — sound against forged noise, over-quieting, and a loud entry
// WITHIN this cell's serialized history. What a fuller stealth game adds is OUT OF SCOPE
// here (each a real, named next rung, not a hole):
//   * GUARD PATROLS / line-of-sight — a per-tick guard position + a "seen iff in the guard's
//     cone" rule is a temporal/geometric predicate over MANY slots, not a single scalar; it
//     wants the multi-cell substrate (a guard cell per patroller) the crate already names;
//   * PER-GUARD ALERT — one `alert` slot per sentinel (a suspicion vector) rather than one
//     global counter: reachable TODAY as N register slots (or N heap keys) each with its own
//     `FieldDelta`/`FieldLte` pair, but the v0 scene compiler has no per-guard syntax, so it
//     would be augmented raw-turn methods like the Hold's `hold_pickup`;
//   * a DECAYING alarm (alert bleeds down over time) — a per-turn `−1` ratchet needs a
//     turn-clock the scene layer does not expose; a `Monotonic`-style DOWN atom plus a clock
//     slot would express it. No core atom is added here; the Crypt is built entirely from
//     `FieldDelta` / `FieldLte` / `FieldGte` that already exist.

=== threshold

A collapsed lychgate, moss-choked, breathing cold. Beyond it the nave of a drowned crypt
waits — and something in the dark is listening.

* [Slip through the broken lychgate]
  -> nave

=== nave

The nave. A barnacled reliquary cage stands over the sanctum door, and down the black
transept the wraith-sentinels drift, roused by every echo. Loud, and they swarm; the
sanctum will not open for a hand that woke the whole crypt.

  -> nave

* [Creep along the shadowed colonnade]
  -> nave

* [Cast a bone-shard down the black transept]
  ~ alert -= 2
  -> nave

* [Ease open the sanctum door] { alert <= 1 && cage_open >= 1 }
  -> reliquary

=== reliquary

The reliquary, hushed and blue. On a bier of black glass the whispering relic waits.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A SIXTH UNIVERSE — "The Vaulted Bazaar": the SAME economy as the Merchant's Bazaar,
// but the PURSE AND STACKS LIVE IN THE HEAP (keys >= STATE_SLOTS), not register slots
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Merchant's Bazaar proved a sound economy — exact payment, exact delivery, a
// quantity that decrements to zero — but it hoisted its purse and every stack into
// FIXED REGISTER SLOTS. It had to: the heap-atom vocabulary ([`HeapAtom`]) had NO
// exact-delta twin, so a heap-keyed quantity could not carry the exact-payment /
// exact-decrement tooth an economy needs. The Bazaar's own "NAMED ATOM GAP" note
// spelled out the missing pieces: `HeapAtom::Delta { d: i64 }` (the heap twin of
// `StateConstraint::FieldDelta`) plus a heap cross-key `Lte` for a live
// `price <= gold` bound.
//
// Both now EXIST in the core (committed):
//   * [`HeapAtom::DeltaEquals`]`{ d: i64 }` — `new[heap key] - old[heap key] == d`
//     over the signed full-field delta, BOTH-present-fail-closed (an absent old OR
//     new REFUSES — no heap init escape). The EXACT-delta heap tooth.
//   * [`StateConstraint::HeapFieldLteOther`]`{ key, other_key, delta }` —
//     `new[heap key] <= new[heap other_key] + delta`, both operands read from the
//     openable `fields_map` heap, ABSENT-either-side-fail-closed. The cross-KEY heap
//     relation the per-key `HeapAtom` vocabulary structurally cannot express (each
//     atom reads only ITS own key).
//
// The Vaulted Bazaar is the Merchant's Bazaar's economy REBUILT with the purse and the
// item stack in the HEAP — retiring the fixed-slot workaround:
//
// | move (raw-turn method)     | executor teeth (all on HEAP keys)                                           |
// |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
// | fund the purse             | `HeapField{gold, WriteOnce}` + `HeapField{potions, WriteOnce}` (establish once) |
// | buy a potion (50g)         | `HeapField{gold, DeltaEquals(-50)}` (exact debit; a broke purse cannot pay without clamping ⇒ refused) + `HeapField{potions, DeltaEquals(+1)}` (exact deliver) |
// | assay (solvency door)      | `HeapFieldLteOther{price <= gold}` (you hold at least the price — a NON-debiting move) |
// | drink a potion             | `HeapField{potions, DeltaEquals(-1)}` (exact decrement; the stack at 0 ⇒ refused) |
//
// ── WHY EACH TOOTH BITES (non-vacuous, DRIVEN below) ──────────────────────────────
//
//   * EXACT DEBIT — the purse-key falls by EXACTLY the price. A buy that writes any
//     other value (an underpay off-by-one, a shoplift that takes the potion while
//     leaving the purse full, a clamped-at-zero broke write) lands `new - old != -price`
//     and is a REAL `WorldError::Refused`. The clamped underflow the register Bazaar
//     caught with `FieldDelta` — now caught on the HEAP with `DeltaEquals`. This is ALSO
//     the affordability enforcement ON the buy: an unaffordable purse (gold < price)
//     cannot land `-price` without clamping, so the debit tooth refuses a broke buy.
//   * SOLVENCY — `HeapFieldLteOther{ key: price, other_key: gold, delta: 0 }` is
//     "you hold at least the price" (`price <= gold`), installed on the `assay` door — a
//     move that does NOT touch gold, so the post-state purse IS the pre-state purse and
//     the cross-key bound is a genuine affordability check (a post-state cross-key gate
//     CANNOT be the affordability check on the debiting buy itself — the last-coin buy
//     and a broke buy BOTH clamp the post-purse to 0, indistinguishable post-state; so
//     solvency lives on a non-debiting door, exactly as the Merchant's Bazaar's
//     counting-room `FieldGte(gold, toll)` gates a move that does not touch gold). This
//     is the cross-key heap bound the Bazaar could only have expressed by hoisting price
//     and purse into register slots.
//   * EXACT DECREMENT — a use writes `potions - 1` under `DeltaEquals{ -1 }`. The stack
//     walks `3 → 2 → 1 → 0` on real committed turns; the next use, the stack empty,
//     writes a clamped `0` whose delta `0 - 0 == 0 != -1` is a REAL executor refusal.
//
// ── INSTALL PATH (the Tidewrack Hold's pattern, not a spween-dregg change) ─────────
//
// Every tooth is installed on the compiled program via [`add_case`] (a fresh
// `MethodIs`-guarded [`TransitionCase`]), and every move rides [`WorldCell::apply_raw`]
// on the heap path — EXACTLY as the Tidewrack Hold installs and drives its heap
// inventory. `spween-dregg` needed NO change: `apply_raw` (raw cap-bounded heap turn)
// and `read_heap` (committed `fields_map` read) already exist and already power the
// Hold. The purse and stack are written with [`stash_effect`] (`SetField` at a key
// `>= STATE_SLOTS`, routed into the committed `fields_map`).
//
// ── HONEST SCOPE — identical to the Merchant's Bazaar, minus the workaround ────────
//
// This is the SAME economy the Merchant's Bazaar has (exact payment/delivery/decrement,
// sound against underflow, underpayment, shoplifting and minting WITHIN this cell's
// serialized history), with the purse-and-stacks moved OFF fixed registers and INTO the
// heap — the fixed-slot workaround retired. Gold is still a COUNTER funded at genesis
// (the `fund` turn), NOT a conserved `Effect::Transfer` of computrons — the same honest
// boundary the Bazaar drives (`conserved_transfer_is_out_of_reach_gold_is_a_counter`);
// a globally-conserved economy is still the multi-cell rung. And these teeth are
// EXECUTOR-ENFORCED cell-program predicates: the AIR that carries `DeltaEquals` /
// `HeapFieldLteOther` into a proof is the named follow-up (the Lean twins
// `Dregg2.Exec.HeapAtom.deltaEquals` / `RelationalCaveat.heapFieldLteOther` exist; the
// circuit teeth are the next rung), exactly as the register Bazaar's `FieldDelta` is
// executor-enforced today.
