//! **C.5 — the fold-leg split (Leg R ∘ Leg A).** FAST battery (no proving): the
//! monolithic turn is carved into two foldable custom leaves connected by the
//! intermediate board root `mid_root`.
//!
//!  - **Leg R** (`old → mid`): validity + m=2 conflict + chain-follow/flow-through +
//!    board rewrite, PUBLISHING `mid_root = board_root8(mid)` as its new-root app PI.
//!  - **Leg A** (`mid → new`): the automaton gadget on the resolved board, CONSUMING
//!    the byte-identical `board_root8(mid)` as its old-root app PI.
//!
//! Shadowed by `Builder::air_accepts`, this asserts: (1) each leg refines its half of
//! the oracle exactly and is non-vacuous (a forged `mid`/`new` is REJECTED); (2) the
//! composed `automaton_step ∘ resolve_mid == apply_turn` (the corrected reference);
//! (3) THE SEAM — Leg R's published `mid_root` byte-matches Leg A's consumed old-root
//! on the honest path, and DIVERGES when Leg A is fed a different `mid` than Leg R
//! produced (the per-lane connect conflict that makes a forged mid UNSAT in the fold).
//! The real prove + fold + light-client accept lives in `tests/prove_fold.rs`.
