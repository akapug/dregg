//! # The **Offering** — automatafl playable on every dreggnet frontend.
//!
//! [`AutomataflOffering`] hosts an n=2 automatafl match as a [`dreggnet_offerings::Offering`]: the
//! same `open`/`actions`/`advance`/`verify`/`render`/`render_for`/`price` shape every frontend
//! (web / Discord / Telegram / WeChat) already drives. It is the coordinate-grid sibling of
//! `dregg-multiway-tug`'s `TugOffering`: where the tug paints a hidden HAND, automatafl paints a
//! hidden MOVE on a shared BOARD.
//!
//! **The board is a [`deos_view::ViewNode::CoordGrid`]** — one [`deos_view::CoordCell`] per square,
//! the particle as the glyph (`·` vacuum, `R` repulsor, `A` attractor, `@` automaton), the
//! automaton cell marked, and each affordance-bearing square carrying the `{turn, arg}` a click
//! fires. Selecting one of your pieces LIGHTS ITS ROOK LINE: every legal target of that source
//! (same row or column, in-bounds, not the automaton's square — exactly
//! [`crate::reference::move_valid`]) is painted in the highlight-set; an illegal target (a diagonal,
//! the source itself, the automaton) is NOT.
//!
//! **The simultaneous-move shape, rendered.** Automatafl's turn is not alternating: both players
//! move at once. So the surface runs COMMIT → REVEAL → RESOLVE:
//! 1. **commit** — each seat selects a source and seals a destination. The executor stores only the
//!    COMMITMENT (a blake3 seal over the move + a per-turn nonce), never the plaintext;
//! 2. **reveal** — each seat opens its seal (the plaintext lands on the cell, checked against the
//!    commitment it opens);
//! 3. **resolve** — ONE real turn applies [`crate::reference::apply_turn`]: invalid moves filtered,
//!    conflicts dropped, the surviving moves applied, and the automaton takes its step.
//!
//! [`Offering::render_for`] paints the table AS A VIEWER SEES IT: the viewer's own committed move is
//! shown in full (they know what they sealed), while the opponent's is FOG — a sealed commitment, no
//! source, no destination — until the reveal. So seat A's move appears in A's view and not in B's.
//!
//! **Every advance is a REAL turn.** `select` / `commit` / `reveal` / `resolve` each commit the whole
//! witnessed state to a deployed [`crate::game::AutomataflGame`] world-cell under the matching
//! method; the executor's teeth (board immutable during the commit phase, strictly-monotone
//! commit/reveal counters, particle-code membership + a write-once winner on the resolution) admit a
//! legal turn and REFUSE an illegal one — [`Outcome::Landed`] with a genuine `TurnReceipt`, or
//! [`Outcome::Refused`] with nothing committed (anti-ghost).
//!
//! HONEST SCOPE: the seal HIDES the move by non-reveal on this trusted host (the commitment is what
//! the cell holds; the plaintext lives in the session until the reveal) — the *in-proof* sealed move
//! (the commitment opened inside the AIR, folded as a custom leaf) is the named next lane, exactly
//! as the tug's in-proof hidden hand is. The board TRANSITION is already proven in-circuit by
//! [`crate::air`] (`new == apply_turn(old, moves)`); this surface drives the same reference oracle
//! the AIR pins.
