//! # `beacon` — the drand-beacon → daily-seed wire (the "single most valuable wire").
//!
//! [`daily_seed`](crate::daily_seed) turns a **committed epoch value** into a fresh, fair
//! dungeon seed everyone can re-derive. This module supplies that epoch value from a REAL
//! **threshold public-randomness beacon** (drand / League of Entropy), closing the gap the
//! crate docs name: with a genuine beacon output the daily seed is
//! **unpredictable-until-revealed**, **identical world-wide**, and **verifiable by
//! re-derivation** — the three properties a "today's dungeon everyone plays" needs.
//!
//! ```text
//!   drand round (round, threshold-BLS signature)
//!        │  verify_beacon_round  (BLS pairing e(sig,g2)==e(H(round),pk), output==H(sig))
//!        ▼
//!   beacon output  =  H(signature)   ── the committed epoch value ──▶  daily_seed  ──▶  CommittedSeed
//!        │                                                                                   │
//!        ▼                                                                                   ▼
//!   (unpredictable until the round matures)                                     the day's procgen dungeon
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the three properties hold
//!
//! - **Unpredictable-until-revealed.** A drand round's output is a *threshold* BLS signature
//!   by the network's distributed key: no coalition below threshold can produce it, so the
//!   day's signature — and therefore the day's seed — does not exist until the round matures.
//!   You cannot grind a favourable dungeon: a forged signature is REFUSED by the pairing check
//!   ([`DailyBeacon::verify`]), and the round is a deterministic function of the day
//!   ([`quicknet_round_for_utc_day`]), so no favourable-round picking either.
//! - **Identical world-wide.** The seed is a pure function of the (public) beacon output, and
//!   the dungeon is a pure function of the seed. Everyone who sees the round derives the same
//!   `CommittedSeed` and re-generates the byte-identical dungeon.
//! - **Verifiable by re-derivation.** Holding only public data — the round, the signature, and
//!   the genesis-pinned drand group key — anyone runs [`DailyBeacon::verify`] then
//!   [`daily_seed`](crate::daily_seed) and re-derives the exact seed, then
//!   [`regenerate`](crate::regenerate) the byte-identical `.dungeon`.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - The **verification** is real drand interop (a BLS pairing check against the pinned
//!   `quicknet` group key; the crate's own tests verify a real published round). The
//!   **producer** half — *fetching* `(round, signature)` from a drand node over HTTP — lives
//!   below behind the injected [`RoundFetch`] transport seam ([`todays_beacon`] is the
//!   default live path); the verifier itself stays a pure function of public data.
//! - The live fetch can fail (no egress, a drand outage). The pinned published round is the
//!   **explicit, labeled** fallback: [`todays_beacon`] returns a [`ResolvedDailyBeacon`]
//!   whose [`BeaconSource`] says *which* beacon a caller got — [`BeaconSource::Live`] or
//!   [`BeaconSource::PinnedFallback`] (with its staleness) — so a surface can never honestly
//!   render the pinned round as if it were today's. A fetched round that FAILS verification
//!   is a hard error, never a silent fallback.
//! - "Unpredictable" is the drand **threshold assumption** (no sub-threshold coalition signs a
//!   future round). This wire *binds* that beacon and makes each day's binding verifiable; it
//!   does not re-prove the threshold assumption.

// when BOTH verify), so the root is POST-QUANTUM unforgeable — but a within-threshold
// proposer can grind block content to steer `H(root)`, so it is not on its own
// bias-resistant.
//
// Folding both closes each other's gap:
//   * PQ-UNFORGEABLE — a quantum adversary who forges the drand round still cannot
//     move the root half (that needs an ML-DSA-65 quorum forgery).
//   * UNBIASABLE IF EITHER SOURCE IS HONEST — an honest drand round is a uniform,

//     ground root only permutes an unknown-to-it uniform value; and an honest
//     federation root fixes an input the drand side cannot bias at all (drand rounds
//     are unique per round, and the round is a pure function of the day).
//   * NATIVE-DEGRADABLE — drand down ⇒ root-only; the federation absent (offline /
//     test) ⇒ the existing drand-only or pinned path, unchanged.
//
// THE ORDERING TOOTH. The root must be FIXED BEFORE the drand round it mixes with
// MATURES (by at least one drand period). Otherwise a proposer who has already SEEN
// the day's drand output could grind the root against it and steer the composed seed.
