//! # procgen-dregg — provably-fair procedural dungeon generation
//!
//! A dungeon generated from a **committed, verifiable seed**: the same seed yields
//! the same dungeon, provably, and a new fair dungeon every day. The pipeline is
//!
//! ```text
//!   committed seed  ->  dregg-dice RandomnessRequest  ->  a VERIFIED DrawStream
//!                   ->  a deterministic dungeon graph  ->  a VALID `.dungeon` source
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why it is provably fair
//!
//! Randomness is the real [`dregg_dice`] machinery — never `rand`:
//!
//! - The committed seed is folded into a [`RandomnessRequest`]. Its
//!   [`RandomnessRequest::commitment`] is the receipt-shaped value an engine would
//!   publish *before* the dungeon exists, binding the whole generation context.
//! - The seed is obtained through the source's **pure verifier**
//!   ([`RandomnessSource::seed`]): a producer emits evidence, the verifier
//!   re-derives the seed and checks the transcript commitment. Producer and
//!   verifier agree, so no one can grind by swapping in a favourable seed.
//! - Every draw is an entry of the [`DrawStream`] — the **reject-free, unbiased**
//!   bounded mapping ([`DrawStream::draw_bounded`]), with a fixed [`DRAW_COUNT`]
//!   bound up-front and committed by the transcript. No ad-hoc rejection sampling,
//!   no `rand`, no data-dependent draw count. Every enrichment below — the biome,
//!   the layout shape, each room's archetype, each encounter, each piece of loot —
//!   is one indexed draw at a *fixed* index, so the whole richer world is still a
//!   pure function of the committed seed, reproduced byte-for-byte by any verifier.
//!
//! A verifier who holds the committed seed re-derives the exact same draws and
//! re-generates the **byte-identical** dungeon ([`regenerate`]) — that is what
//! binds the committed seed to the dungeon.
//!
//! ## What is generated
//!
//! A connected graph of rooms (always a spanning **tree**, so the objective is
//! always reachable from `start`) drawn in one of four **layout shapes** (sprawl /
//! corridor / hub / branch), with reciprocal exits, **at least one gated exit**
//! (`requires item <key>`) isolating the objective, a placed key and win-item, and
//! an `objective:`. On top of that structural skeleton the generator draws a
//! **biome** (one of several themed content families) and, per room, an
//! **archetype** (a room type that colours its name), an **encounter** (themed
//! guardians beaten by a themed weapon, plus a boss guarding the gate), and
//! **loot** (treasure, healing draughts, and — where a biome hazard is in play —
//! tainted caches and their antidotes). A biome may also seed a lore-bearing **NPC**
//! and a **blessing spell** at a shrine. Every one of these is a first-class
//! `.dungeon` construct: the emitted text parses and validates through the shipped
//! `attested_dm::parse_dungeon` / `validate` with zero errors (see the tests).
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - **Fairness of the *seed itself* rests on the seed being a committed / beacon
//!   value**, not on this generator. With [`daily_seed`] the seed is derived from
//!   an epoch commitment you supply; supply a real public beacon output (drand via
//!   [`dregg_dice::DrandBeacon`]) and the *unpredictability* is a threshold-beacon
//!   guarantee. The [`Deterministic`] source used here gives **reproducibility and
//!   binding**, not unpredictability — whoever knows the committed value knows the
//!   dungeon. That is the correct property for a daily seed everyone can re-verify.
//! - Generation is **structurally faithful and content-rich but not infinite**: the
//!   biomes, archetypes, encounters, and loot are drawn from finite curated tables.
//!   The guarantee is the pipeline (committed seed -> verified draws -> valid,
//!   *varied* dungeon), not an unbounded content library — a new table entry is a
//!   one-line addition that every seed can then draw.
