//! THE AFFORDANCE SURFACE — a cell's published, cap-gated message set, projected
//! per-viewer by the proven attenuation lattice.
//!
//! A cell exposes a set of named [`Affordance`]s (the deos analogue of a server's
//! htmx endpoints). Each carries the `required` authority a viewer must HOLD to
//! see/fire it; [`AffordanceSurface::project_for`] filters by `is_attenuation`
//! (`required ⊆ held`). A weaker viewer sees fewer; an admin sees more; lacking
//! authority → the affordance is simply absent.
//!
//! Ported from starbridge-v2's gpui-free `affordance.rs`, but **decoupled from the
//! window `SurfaceCapability`**: the held authority is a bare `AuthRequired` (the
//! same the executor's cap-gate and `deos-js`'s applet already speak), so the
//! projection is reusable over the substance, not the cockpit window stack.
