//! **The shared [`ViewNode`] → plain-text walk** — the *prose* projection of the one IR.
//!
//! Two chat transports need the SAME prose: a Telegram message (text + an inline keyboard) and a
//! WeChat OA message (text + a numbered reply list). Both project the view-tree's *content* half —
//! room prose, party state, section titles — and both carry the *affordance* half OUT of the text
//! (Telegram as the keyboard, WeChat as the numbered block). That shared half lives here, ONCE, so
//! the second chat backend is a codec + a numbered block, never a second subset walker (the
//! subsetting IS the evidence they diverged — `docs/SURFACE-ONE-GATE-FOUR-PLANES.md`, safe-move #2).
//!
//! [`crate::telegram::render_text`] IS this function (re-exported); [`crate::wechat::WeChatBackend`]
//! calls it for its prose. FULL node coverage: every container recurses (an affordance/section
//! nested in a `Table`/`Grid`/`Tabs`/`Host`/`Adept` still contributes its text) rather than dropping
//! silently.
