//! `source_health` — the console's **source-honesty layer**: where the dashboard's
//! data came from and whether the source answered, so a face can always tell the
//! viewer what they are looking at.
//!
//! Ported dregg-native from the prior operated layer (`SourceHealth`,
//! model.rs:229-301) — the epistemics the retired console enforced and the native
//! console card does not yet carry:
//!
//! * **unreachable ≠ empty** — a source that did not answer must render as
//!   "can't reach", NEVER as an empty account with get-started CTAs;
//! * **demo/fixture data is labeled** — baked demo data renders with a banner,
//!   never passed off as a live read;
//! * **unconfigured ≠ broken** — no source configured at all is a calm
//!   "not connected" notice, with the resource panels absent entirely (no false
//!   empty states);
//! * **partial reads are partial** — a surface that failed renders a load error
//!   in its panel while the surfaces that answered render their data;
//! * **not-served is an honest empty** — a surface the source answers "not
//!   found" for (it does not serve it yet) may render an empty panel honestly.
//!
//! This module is the pure model (std + serde only, like the rest of the
//! `dumb-views` floor). Faces consume [`SourceHealth::banner`] for the page-level
//! notice and [`SourceHealth::surface_note`] per panel; `panels_renderable`
//! decides whether resource panels appear at all.
//!
//! WIRED: `console::ConsoleModel` carries a `health: SourceHealth` field (default
//! healthy-live); `console_card` renders the [`Banner`] page-level, gates the
//! resource panels on [`SourceHealth::panels_renderable`], and paints each panel's
//! [`SurfaceNote`]; the cap-scoped catalog reports health through
//! `catalog::Catalog::health` and `ConsoleModel::from_catalog` carries it through.
