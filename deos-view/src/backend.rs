//! **The `SurfaceBackend` trait** — the one seat every renderer of the [`ViewNode`] IR shares.
//!
//! A backend takes the SAME (mount-resolved, disclosed) view-tree + its live bind values and
//! projects it onto its channel's output ([`render`](SurfaceBackend::render) → an HTML string, a
//! Discord card, Telegram text, …), and it [`decode`](SurfaceBackend::decode)s an actuation id
//! that channel carried back into the `{turn, arg}` affordance to fire. Decoding is the ONE
//! [`crate::affordance`] codec, selected by the backend's [`transport`](SurfaceBackend::transport)
//! — so every backend round-trips its own encoded affordances by construction.
//!
//! This is the extraction of the previously ad-hoc render functions (`web::render_html`,
//! `discord::render_card`, the moved-in web-form + Telegram-text walkers) behind one trait; the
//! frontend crates (`dreggnet-web`, `dreggnet-telegram`) render through the deos-view backends
//! instead of maintaining their own subset walkers.
