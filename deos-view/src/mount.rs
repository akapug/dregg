//! **The cell-heap-as-view-source** — read a cell's hosted view-tree out of its committed
//! heap (the native half of the composition keystone, `docs/deos/CELL-HOSTED-VIEWTREE.md`).
//!
//! A cell HOSTS a view-tree: its serialized `{kind,props,children}` JSON is stored as a
//! **heap blob** under collection [`VIEWTREE_COLL`], chunked across the cell's committed
//! `CellState::heap_map` (the sorted-Poseidon2 `(collection, key) → felt` map digested by
//! `heap_root`). This is the SAME proven chunked-heap-blob mechanism the program-in-cell weld
//! uses for the program blob (`deos-js::portable::{write,read}_program_blob`), under a
//! DISJOINT collection — so a cell can carry both its program and its hosted view-tree.
//!
//! Storing the view-tree in the heap means it is part of the cell's COMMITTED state: it
//! travels with the cell, is committed by `heap_root`, and a receipted edit to it (a
//! `ViewPatch` written back here) moves the root — a light client witnesses the surface
//! evolving. [`view_tree_from_cell_heap`] is the read side; a host node's mount resolves
//! through a [`MountSource`](crate::tree::MountSource) that calls it (see
//! [`ledger_mount_source`]).
//!
//! This module is NATIVE-only (it needs `dregg-cell`); the pure resolver + the `MountSource`
//! trait live in [`crate::tree`] (serde-only), so the gpui-free `web`/`discord` renderers
//! walk the resolved tree without ever depending on the heap.
