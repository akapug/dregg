//! THE COMPOSITION KEYSTONE, BY RUNNING: a cell HOSTS its own view-tree in its committed
//! heap, and a parent card MOUNTS that whole tree as a subtree — distinct from `bind` (one
//! scalar) and value-transclusion (a snapshot). Hosted trees contain `host` mounts of OTHER
//! cells → FRACTAL recursion (cells-host-cells-host-view-trees). This proves, end-to-end:
//!
//!   1. A child cell and a grandchild cell each store a hosted view-tree as a heap blob
//!      (the proven chunked-heap-blob codec, under `VIEWTREE_COLL` — the cell-heap-as-view-
//!      source). The child's hosted tree itself contains a `host(grandchild)` node.
//!   2. A parent card `host(child)`s the child. `resolve_mounts` reads the child's tree off
//!      its heap, and — recursing — the grandchild's tree off ITS heap, splicing a 2-LEVEL
//!      fractal nest. Rendered to REAL gpui-component pixels, the child + grandchild trees
//!      appear nested inside the parent (PNG #1).
//!   3. A RECEIPTED edit to the child's hosted tree (a real verified turn on the child cell,
//!      plus the rewritten view-tree blob written back into its committed heap) re-resolves
//!      into a CHANGED rendered subtree (PNG #2 differs from #1) — the surface is a living
//!      verified object.
