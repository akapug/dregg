//! Rotated replay-chain verify — the standalone chain verifier. No code path here
//! calls a prover (see the crate docblock on what is nevertheless LINKED).
//!
//! # What a leg is, and how the chain closes
//!
//! Each [`RotatedReplayLeg`] mirrors the SDK's `AttachedSubProof` for the
//! `"effect-vm-rotated"` label: a postcard-serialized `Ir2BatchProof`, the rotated
//! PI vector, and the cohort descriptor's `vk_hash`. The rotated PI vector
//! PREFIXES the v1 PI layout, so the v1 offsets sit where the v1 leg puts them:
//! `pi::OLD_COMMIT` = 0, `pi::NEW_COMMIT` = 8 (Phase C widened `OLD_COMMIT_LEN` to 8),
//! `pi::TURN_HASH_BASE` = 26. A WIDE leg
//! additionally publishes the FULL 8-felt before/after commits as its LAST 16 PIs.
//! Real widths, measured: `V1_PI_COUNT` = 35 (the v1 prefix), `ROT_PI_COUNT` = 39
//! (the prefix plus the four appended rotated pins), `ROT_NULLIFIER_PI_COUNT` = 40
//! for a note-spend leg, `WIDE_PI_COUNT` = 59 for the wide core.
//!
//! # ⚑ FLAG DAY 2026-08-05 — this floor now accepts what the WIRE emits, at the WIRE's width
//!
//! Until this commit [`verify_rotated_leg`] iterated ONLY `V3_STAGED_REGISTRY_TSV`
//! (the 1-felt / ~31-bit stratum), while every production producer
//! (`dregg_sdk::prove_cohort_run_chain`, `dregg_turn_prover::proven_receipt`) emits
//! WIDE or WIDE+UMEM-WELDED legs. A production proof handed to this floor verified
//! under NO member and was REJECTED — the subcommand could not return "verified"
//! for anything a real node had produced. The module's own docblock called that
//! "behind the WIDE flip by construction" and deferred it; that is a check nobody
//! could pass, which is not a floor.
//!
//! Two changes, and they must be taken together:
//!
//! 1. **The accepted set is the DEPLOYED set.** [`verify_rotated_leg`] now collects
//!    accepting members from `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` and the DERIVED welded-wide
//!    set (`welded_wide_members()`) — the same two the SDK's
//!    `verify_effect_vm_rotated_inner` admits — and, additionally, the bare
//!    `V3_STAGED_REGISTRY_TSV` for the 1-felt residual (the 3 gentian Sat members
//!    have no wide twin, and this floor's own test producers mint narrow). Selector
//!    binding is unchanged: EXACTLY ONE member may accept.
//! 2. **The chain anchors are 8-felt.** Reading a WIDE leg's ~124-bit anchor at its
//!    narrow slot-0 position is the exact defect `vk_hash_is_wide` was introduced to
//!    fix in the SDK, so adding wide acceptance without widening the anchor would
//!    have re-shipped it. [`verify_rotated_replay_chain`] now takes `[BabyBear; 8]`
//!    endpoints and reads each leg at its TRUE width: a leg whose `vk_hash` is a
//!    wide-registry (or welded) fingerprint is bound on its LAST 16 PIs; a narrow V3
//!    leg is bound on its single `pi::OLD_COMMIT`/`pi::NEW_COMMIT` felt broadcast
//!    into lane 0, with the other seven lanes zero. That is the SAME rule
//!    `dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound` applies, so the two floors agree.
//!
//! **What re-emits / breaks:** the `rotated-replay-chain` request JSON's
//! `expected_old_commit` / `expected_new_commit` are now 8-element arrays of
//! canonical `u32` BabyBear lanes, not single integers. A request written before
//! this commit REFUSES TO LOAD with a parse error rather than being reinterpreted.
//! Nothing persists these requests; re-emit them from the producer. Callers of
//! `verify_rotated_replay_chain` pass `[BabyBear; 8]`; a narrow-leg caller widens
//! its felt with [`narrow_commit_anchor`].
//!
//! # The anti-ghost teeth (what makes this NOT a stub)
//!
//! 1. **Per-leg crypto verify** ([`verify_rotated_leg`]) — the IR-v2 batch proof
//!    must verify against a committed cohort descriptor via the audited
//!    `verify_vm_descriptor2`. A forged / corrupted proof has no satisfying
//!    witness and is rejected. The verify is SELECTOR-BOUND (a sound rotated
//!    proof verifies under EXACTLY ONE cohort descriptor — its own effect's), so
//!    a proof that verifies under zero or multiple descriptors is rejected rather
//!    than laundered under the wrong selector.
//! 2. **vk_hash pin** — the attached `vk_hash` must equal the descriptor-identity
//!    fingerprint of the uniquely-accepting member. For a SHIPPED member that is the
//!    blake3 of the committed JSON its registry line carries; for a DERIVED welded
//!    member there is no committed string, so it is the canonical-bytes fingerprint
//!    (`welded_descriptor_vk_hash`). A tampered vk_hash is rejected even when the
//!    proof is selector-bound (Wall A.1).
//! 3. **Endpoint + adjacency** ([`verify_rotated_replay_chain`]) — the caller
//!    supplies the pre/post commitments it trusts; the first leg's before-anchor
//!    and last leg's after-anchor must match, and interior adjacency must close.
//!    A tampered / dropped middle leg breaks adjacency (anti-ghost at the chain
//!    layer). A wrong-root caller expectation is rejected at the endpoints.
//! 4. **Receipt binding** ([`crate::check_receipt_pi_binding`], run per leg by
//!    [`verify_rotated_replay_chain`]) — each leg carries the [`RotatedReplayLeg::receipt`]
//!    it attests, and the chain enforces `PI[TURN_HASH_BASE..+4] ==
//!    canonical_32_to_felts_4(receipt.turn_hash)` (T11 — a genuine proof of turn A
//!    cannot be relabelled onto a receipt naming turn B) plus the receipt chain-walk
//!    `receipt[k].previous_receipt_hash == receipt[k-1].receipt_hash()` (T8).
//!
//! # Isolation
//!
//! This module composes ONLY proven Lean-emitted verify surfaces from
//! `dregg-circuit` (`descriptor_ir2::verify_vm_descriptor2`, the committed
//! registries). It authors NO constraint (LAW #1) and pulls in no prover, ledger,
//! or executor state — the standalone-verifier invariant holds.
