//! # THE VK-EPOCH FAMILY-2 LIGHT-CLIENT CLOSE — Refusal + the lifecycle PAYLOAD: the HONEST state.
//!
//! ## What this measures (`.docs-history-noclaude/VK-EPOCH-PLAN.md`, STAGE B/C, family 2 — the CLOSED state)
//!
//! Family 1 (`vk_epoch_perms_vk_light_client_binding.rs`) is GENUINELY closed: setPermissions / setVK
//! carry an IN-CIRCUIT `permsVKWeldGate` welding the committed AFTER perms/vk sub-limb (limb 33/34) to
//! `param0`, and `param0` is the post-value bound into the PI-anchored `effects_hash` (a value a
//! ledgerless light client independently knows from the effect). So a perms-/vk-only forged post-cell is
//! UNSAT through `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — NO verifier PI override, NO `apply_effect_to_cell`. The
//! deployed `setPermsVmDescriptor2R24` carries 107 constraints (the bare rotated 106 + the ONE weld);
//! the forge test rejects with `failed constraints = [the weld]`, the anchor not in the loop.
//!
//! Family 2 — Refusal + the lifecycle PAYLOAD — is now ALSO CLOSED for a ledgerless light client (a
//! DIFFERENT in-circuit primitive than family-1's single-param weld: a map-op WRITE gate / a HASH gate).
//! The deployed `refusalVmDescriptor2R24` carries — BESIDE the record-digest pin — a single `.write`
//! map-op (guard = `SEL_REFUSAL` col 52, key = the constant `refusalAuditKeyFelt = 529176517` =
//! `field_key_hash(REFUSAL_AUDIT_EXT_KEY)`, value = the declared audit-felt param col, root = the openable
//! limb-36 `fields_root`). It is the LAST constraint past the `rotateV3WithRecordPin B_RECORD_DIGEST`
//! base — so the deployed refusal row carries 107 constraints (the 1-felt registry) / 147 (the wide
//! registry the verifier reads), exactly ONE map-op (vs noteSpend's TWO: `.absent` + `.insert`). The
//! map-op FORCES `after_fields_root == write(before_fields_root, REFUSAL_AUDIT_KEY → audit_felt(params))`.
//!
//! So on the LIGHT-CLIENT path — `verify_vm_descriptor2` over the producer-published dpis, which is
//! EXACTLY what the deployed SDK verifier `full_turn_proof::verify_effect_vm_rotated_with_cutover` runs —
//! a refusal forged to publish a self-consistent post-cell differing ONLY in the refusal-`fields_root`
//! audit is REJECTED: its forged after-`fields_root` (limb 36) ≠ the genuine sorted write, and under CR
//! the write is FUNCTIONAL (`writesTo_functional`), so there is NO satisfying assignment — NO off-cell
//! anchor required. The PI-46 record-digest pin the row also carries is now belt-and-suspenders on the
//! FULL-NODE leg (the `proof_verify.rs` step-6b `compute_authority_digest_felt(apply_effect_to_cell(...))`
//! anchor still bites, redundantly, exactly as it does for setPerms/setVK).
//!
//! ## WHY refusal needed the map-op write gate (not the perms/VK-style single-param weld)
//!
//! perms/VK weld the AFTER sub-limb to `prmCol 0`, an IN-CIRCUIT declared-param column whose value is a
//! light-client-known function of the effect (`perms_digest_felt(P)` / `vk_digest_felt(VK)`, carried
//! verbatim by the effect's `permissions_hash` / `vk_hash` field, bound through `effects_hash`).
//!
//! Refusal's write is `fields_root' = map_insert(fields_root, REFUSAL_AUDIT_EXT_KEY, audit_felt(params))`
//! (`apply.rs::apply_refusal`). The audit VALUE `audit_felt = hash("dregg-refusal-audit-v1",
//! offered_action_commitment, reason)` IS effect-param-derivable. But the committed limb the light client
//! must bind is the `fields_root` ROOT (limb 36) / its fold into the authority residue (limb 24) — a
//! sorted-Poseidon2 MAP root that depends on the PRE-`fields_root`. There is NO single declared param
//! equal to it (`refusalVmDescriptor`'s params are `REFUSAL_TARGET` / `REFUSAL_REASON_HASH`, neither the
//! post-root), and committing `audit_felt` in a NEW dedicated sub-limb would DIVERGE the wire commitment
//! from the cell-side commitment (`compute_canonical_state_commitment`, which folds the audit INTO
//! `fields_root`), breaking the §1b faithfulness that makes ledger state need NO migration. So the
//! GENUINE force is a **`fields_root` map-op WRITE gate** (the noteSpend gold standard:
//! `after_root == sorted_write(before_root, KEY, audit_felt(params))` checked in-circuit, with a
//! `fields_root` tree witness threaded into `map_heaps`). That gate is now DEPLOYED: limb 36 carries the
//! OPENABLE sorted-Poseidon2 `fields_root` (`cell::state::compute_fields_root`), and the prove path
//! `generate_rotated_refusal_trace_with_fields_tree` threads the BEFORE leaf-set as `map_heaps` so the
//! map-op can open it (the data-availability plumbing the prior framing had as out-of-scope is landed).
//!
//! The lifecycle PAYLOAD (cellSeal limb 29) is closed by a sibling primitive: the DISC (the safety-
//! critical transition) is in-circuit-forced (`rotateV3WithDiscGate`), AND the OPAQUE payload felt
//! `lifecycle_felt(disc, reason_hash, sealed_at)` — a FELT-DOMAIN Poseidon2 hash of light-client-known
//! inputs (`reason_hash` = effect param, `sealed_at = block_height`) — is now welded to the declared
//! payload-hash column `prmCol 3` by the in-circuit `lifecyclePayloadHashGate`. So a forged payload
//! (committed limb 29 ≠ the recomputed payload hash) is UNSAT anchor-disabled.
//!
//! ## The two poles (both teeth — GREEN = it asserts the CURRENT TRUTH)
//!
//! Run through `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE (the light-client path; NO
//! `apply_effect_to_cell`, NO verifier PI override). For refusal:
//!
//!   * POSITIVE (no downgrade): an HONEST refusal turn proves + verifies (the genuine fields-root write
//!     satisfies the map-op gate).
//!   * LIGHT-CLIENT CLOSE (anchor-disabled): a post-cell forged to differ ONLY in the refusal-`fields_root`
//!     audit, with its OWN producer-free dpis, is REJECTED through `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — the
//!     in-circuit `.write` map-op bites for a ledgerless client (NO verifier-anchored PI 46 needed).
//!
//! This is the LIVE realization of `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.refusalFieldsWriteV3_forces_write` (refusal) /
//! `cellSealV3_payload_rejects_forged_lightclient` (lifecycle payload), threaded to the apex
//! `lightclient_unfoolable_closed_final_genuine`. The deployed-descriptor structural witness — the single
//! refusal `.write` map-op — is checked by `effect_vm_descriptors`'s registry coverage tests; the LIVE
//! deployed-descriptor prove/verify forge close is also exercised by
//! `effect_vm_rotation_flip::rotated_audit_record_pin_forces_record_digest_and_rejects_frozen_forgery`.
//!
//! Gated on `prover`. Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover --test vk_epoch_refusal_lifecycle_light_client_binding -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
