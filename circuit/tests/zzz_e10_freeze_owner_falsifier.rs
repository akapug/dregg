//! E10-FREEZE-FALSIFIER — the frozen-authority falsifier on the no-freeze member `cellSeal`,
//! made OWNER-LIMB-PRECISE (circuit-minimality campaign, item E10).
//!
//! ## The open witness-gen-perimeter unknown this probe resolves
//!
//! 41 of the 57 rotated cohort members carry ZERO freeze-shaped `colEq` gates. `cellSeal` is one:
//! `cellSealVmDescriptor2R24` is `v3Of (rotateV3WithRecordPin B_LIFECYCLE …)` — it appends ONLY the
//! lifecycle record-pin (PI[46] ← the AFTER `B_LIFECYCLE` limb) + the lifecycle-payload hash gate.
//! It is NOT `v3OfFrozen`: it carries NONE of `frozenAuthorityColEqs`
//! (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.lean`), because it is an authority MOVER (the lifecycle legitimately
//! flips Live→Sealed).
//!
//! The operated cell's OWNER key — the `pubkey8` octet at `B_PUBKEY_OCTET = 105..112`
//! (`rotation_witness.rs::produce`, `canonical_32_to_felts_8(cell.public_key())`) — is absorbed
//! UNCONDITIONALLY into `state_commit`/NEW_COMMIT via the `wireCommitR` chain, but is welded by NO
//! `colEq` (`frozenAuthorityColEqs` freezes r23 · lifecycle · perms · vk · mode · fields-root +
//! the 7 headroom + 14 perms/vk completion + 56 fields[0..7] completion limbs — the pubkey octet is
//! in NONE of them) and pinned to NO PI on the plain-seal path (the sovereign KEY_COMMIT rider
//! reads the BEFORE octet and only fires on `makeSovereign` wide). So `cellSeal`'s AFTER owner limb
//! is a free felt on the AFTER side.
//!
//! The one candidate compensator is verifier-side PI reconstruction. It does NOT compensate:
//! `proof_verify.rs::verify_and_commit_proof_rotated` (doc-comment lines 523-526) anchors PI[42]
//! (rotated OLD commit) to the ledger's stored pre-state commitment, but PI[43] (rotated NEW commit)
//! ← `turn.execution_proof_new_commitment` — the prover's CLAIMED post-state, tied by `pi_binding`
//! to the trace's AFTER `B_STATE_COMMIT`. It is NOT independently recomputed by re-executing
//! `apply` on the pre-state (that would defeat the STARK). So a self-consistent AFTER block with a
//! forged owner produces a self-consistent NEW_COMMIT the verifier accepts as the new ledger root.
//!
//! ## What this test observes (BYTE-SAFE: no regen, no descriptor-byte change)
//!
//! Over the LIVE deployed `cellSealVmDescriptor2R24` (parsed from the committed staged registry
//! TSV), generate an honest seal, then a SECOND self-consistent seal whose only difference is the
//! AFTER owner octet (owner A → owner B). Drive both through the descriptor-level AIR prove/verify
//! (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2` — the deployed per-descriptor verifier, NOT the
//! contended circuit-prove aggregation prover). The observation: what rejects the changed-owner
//! seal — the AIR, or NOTHING.
//!
//! Reads current behavior in regions untouched by the live heap-open/market dirt. Nothing is
//! regen'd; no VK or descriptor bytes are minted.
