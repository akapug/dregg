//! # THE FRI PARAMS→BITS BUDGET GATE — the knob-drift floor, computed and enforced.
//!
//! The deployed FRI configs carry a soundness budget that lived ONLY in comments
//! (`plonky3_prover::create_config`, `descriptor_ir2::ir2_config`) — a knob edit could silently
//! drop it with no red anywhere. This file computes the budget FROM the exported production knobs
//! and enforces the floors against knob drift.
//!
//! ## The ledger — and what the numbers actually mean (post-audit, 2026-07-13)
//!
//!   * **capacity ledger (REFUTED as a security claim)**: `num_queries × log_blowup +
//!     query_pow_bits`. This is the FRI capacity / up-to-capacity (`1−ρ`) per-query figure every
//!     production STARK historically quoted. **The capacity conjecture is REFUTED** for coset
//!     Reed–Solomon at rates covering our `ρ = 1/64` (Kambiré, arXiv 2604.09724 / eprint
//!     2025/2046). So this column is NOT a proven, nor even conjecturally-safe, security number —
//!     it is retained ONLY as the historical arithmetic and as a stable knob-drift baseline.
//!   * **proven (Johnson bound)**: `num_queries × log_blowup / 2 + query_pow_bits` — the
//!     list-decoding-to-√rate figure that IS proven for any code (`73` at deployed). FLOORED at
//!     `73` (`PROVEN_JOHNSON_FLOOR_BITS`) — see "what changed" below.
//!   * **the number we actually stand behind (~112.6)**: for the deployed dim-2 constant-fold
//!     recursion code, the FIELD-INDEPENDENT counting bound `|Good| ≤ C(64,2) = 2016` over the
//!     quartic-extension challenge field (`|F| ≈ 2^123.6`) proves `2016/|F| < 2⁻¹¹²`, i.e.
//!     **~112.6 proven bits** (`wrap_perFold_soundness_capacity`,
//!     `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.lean` §8). This — not the refuted
//!     capacity 130 — is the accepted standing security posture (ember, 2026-07-13). Sound against
//!     Kambiré: his blow-up needs `n → ∞`, `r > 2`; at our fixed `r = 2`, `n = 64` his own
//!     construction caps at `C(64,2)`.
//!   * **caps**: all figures are additionally capped by the degree-4 BabyBear extension (~2^124
//!     challenge space) and the Poseidon2 commitment hash. The ~112.6 already sits under this cap.
//!
//! ## ⚑ Where the ~112.6 COMES FROM — and therefore which knobs it depends on
//!
//! Read `BabyBearFriDeployedInstance.lean` §2 and `FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.lean` §8 before
//! touching the pins below. The Lean soundness object is
//! `friSetupWrapRate : FriSetup BabyBear (Fin (2^7)) (Fin (2^6)) := friSetupParam 6 omega128 …` —
//! it is built from **`log_blowup = 6` ALONE**:
//!
//!   * `|L| = 2^7 = 128` (the coset), `|κ| = 2^6 = 64` (the FOLDED domain), RS dimension `r = 2`,
//!     giving rate `2/128 = 1/64` — EXACTLY the deployed `log_blowup = 6`.
//!   * The counting bound is `|Good| ≤ C(|κ|, 2) = C(64, 2) = 2016`, and the per-fold error is
//!     `2016 / babyBearP⁴ ≈ 2⁻¹¹²·⁶⁵` (`wrap_perFold_soundness_capacity_interval`).
//!
//! So **`n = 64` and `r = 2` are both consequences of `log_blowup = 6`** (`|κ| = 2^log_blowup`;
//! `r = 2` is the code dimension), and `extDeg = 4` supplies `|F|`. The ~112.6 is a function of
//! `(log_blowup, extDeg)` — it is NOT a function of `max_log_arity` or `log_final_poly_len`.
//!
//! ⚠ **`max_log_arity` and `log_final_poly_len` do NOT enter any soundness formula in this tree,
//! and no Lean theorem consumes them.** `FriVerifier.FriParams` carries `maxLogArity` /
//! `logFinalPolyLen` fields and `ir2LeafWrapConfig` pins them to `3` / `0`
//! (`FriVerifier.lean:373-375`), but they are INERT — grep the metatheory: nothing reads them.
//! `docs/reference/FRI-PARAM-FRONTIER.md` §1a states the same ("Neither is a security lever").
//! **Therefore this file does NOT invent a numeric bound for them.** It pins them by EQUALITY to
//! the modeled config, which is the honest and derivable gate — see below.
//!
//! ⚠ **NAMED RESIDUAL (model-vs-deployment, not closed here).** The Lean per-fold model folds
//! **2-to-1** (`Fin (2^7) → Fin (2^6)`, `Fold geom α f = E f + α·O f`), while the deployed config
//! folds with arity up to **8** (`max_log_arity = 3`). The transfer of the ~112.6 per-fold bound to
//! arity-8 folding is NOT mechanized in-tree. (The gnark ETH-wrap verifier runs arity-2 —
//! `circuit-prove/tests/apex_shrink_blowup_sweep.rs:186`.) The `ModelDrift` pin below exists exactly
//! so that moving arity cannot happen silently while this residual is open.
//!
//! ## What this gate is (and is NOT)
//!
//! The `≥ 128` check below is a CONSERVATIVE ENGINEERING MARGIN on the capacity arithmetic — a
//! knob-drift tooth that reddens when a config edit lowers the (refuted) capacity number. **It is
//! NOT a claim that 128 is proven or conjecturally-safe.** It is KEPT, unchanged, as the labeled
//! drift canary it honestly is. Retargeting the numeric gate off the capacity metric is an ember
//! decision, not this test's to make; the margin is left at 128 (which the deployed capacity 130
//! clears) purely as drift detection.
//!
//! ## Teeth
//!
//!   1. Both deployed configs (v1 `create_config`, IR-v2 `ir2_config`) satisfy `capacity ≥ 128`
//!      and `proven(Johnson) ≥ 73` — and their two ledgers agree (security parity, the invariant
//!      the `(6, 19)` pin was measured against).
//!   2. Both deployed configs carry the modeled structural pair (`max_log_arity = 3`,
//!      `log_final_poly_len = 0`), and the IR-v2 WRAP config equals the Lean-modeled
//!      `ir2LeafWrapConfig` on ALL FIVE knobs — the config every ~112.6 theorem is stated about.
//!   3. NON-VACUITY: `budget_gate_reds_each_degraded_knob` PERTURBS THE DEPLOYED CONSTS — it
//!      degrades each of the **5** gated knobs on each config in turn — and requires `check_budget`,
//!      the same function tooth 1 calls, to refuse with a typed reason NAMING that knob.
//!   4. `proven_floor_is_not_shadowed_by_the_capacity_check` and
//!      `lean_model_pin_reds_wrap_drift_that_clears_both_floors` prove the two NEW floors are
//!      load-bearing rather than redundant: each exhibits a knob set the OTHER gates accept.
//!
//! ## What changed (2026-07-15) — closing CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN Move 5
//!
//! Previously the gate covered 3 of the 5 knobs, and `proven_bits` was computed and printed but
//! never floored. Now: all 5 knobs are gated, and `proven_bits` is floored.
//!
//! ⚑ **Move 5 said "a `proven_bits` floor at ~112". That is arithmetically WRONG and is NOT what
//! landed.** `proven_bits` computes the **Johnson** ledger, which is **73** at the deployed knobs
//! (`19·6/2 + 16`) — flooring it at 112 would red the deployed config instantly. The ~112.6 is a
//! DIFFERENT quantity (the per-fold proximity-gap error over the quartic extension) that this
//! formula does not compute and that these two knobs do not move. So `proven_bits` is floored at
//! its REAL posture (`73`), and the ~112.6 posture is protected the only way it is derivable —
//! by pinning the wrap config to the Lean-modeled knob set the theorem quantifies over.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --test fri_params_soundness_budget -- --nocapture`.
