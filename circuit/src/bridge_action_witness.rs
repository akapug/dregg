//! Bridge action binding AIR (sibling to `note_spending_witness`).
//!
//! # Why a sibling AIR?
//!
//! `note_spending_witness` (and its DSL twin `dsl::note_spending`) already prove
//! knowledge of a spending key + Merkle membership of the note, and pin
//! `nullifier`, `merkle_root`, `value`, `asset_type`, `destination_federation`
//! as public inputs. **However**, each of those PIs is a **single** BabyBear
//! field element (~31 bits). To squeeze a 32-byte hash into one felt the
//! prover/verifier compresses via `bytes_to_babybear` (Poseidon2 hash of 8
//! limbs to one element). That compression is one-way, so it works for
//! soundness, but it has two consequences this AIR fixes:
//!
//! 1. **The full 32 bytes never appear directly in any PI vector**, only their
//!    Poseidon2 digest. A verifier that wants to attribute a bridge mint to a
//!    specific 32-byte recipient commitment (the "who got minted to") cannot
//!    cryptographically check against the recipient bytes — it can only check
//!    against the digest. For a bridge that mints a *new note* on the
//!    destination, the destination wants the proof to say "I am minting to
//!    commitment 0xABCD…", not "I am minting to something that hashes to a
//!    BabyBear felt 0x12345678".
//!
//! 2. **The amount is currently truncated to 30 bits** (`v & ((1<<30)-1)`,
//!    see `turn/src/executor.rs` BridgeMint closure, CAVEAT-LAYER-COVERAGE.md
//!    §6.5, and `circuit/src/effect_vm.rs::BridgeMint::value_lo`). Above
//!    2^30 (~10⁹) the high bits are unrecoverable from the proof — a prover
//!    above that ceiling can claim any high-bit collision. The substrate
//!    AIR is out of this lane's write surface, but the bridge-side proof
//!    can and must carry the full 64 bits.
//!
//! # What this AIR binds
//!
//! Public inputs (all bytes / amount carried at full fidelity):
//!
//! ```text
//! pi[ 0.. 8) = nullifier_limbs[8]              (8 × 4-byte BabyBear limbs)
//! pi[ 8..16) = recipient_limbs[8]              (8 × 4-byte BabyBear limbs)
//! pi[16..24) = destination_federation_limbs[8] (8 × 4-byte BabyBear limbs)
//! pi[24]     = amount_lo   (low  32 bits of u64 amount, BabyBear-encoded)
//! pi[25]     = amount_hi   (high 32 bits of u64 amount, BabyBear-encoded)
//! ```
//!
//! Total = 26 PI slots, ~248 bits of binding strength per 32-byte field, and
//! the full 64 bits of amount (split into two 32-bit limbs, each reduced
//! canonically to BabyBear via `BabyBear::new`).
//!
//! Trace layout (1 row, padded to 4 to satisfy STARK power-of-2 requirements):
//!
//! ```text
//! col  0.. 8) nullifier_limbs[8]
//! col  8..16) recipient_limbs[8]
//! col 16..24) destination_federation_limbs[8]
//! col 24      amount_lo
//! col 25      amount_hi
//! ```
//!
//! Boundary constraints pin each trace column at row 0 to the corresponding
//! PI slot. The verifier passes the exact same 26 BabyBears it received from
//! the executor; any mismatch on any column fails STARK verification.
//!
//! # What this AIR does NOT do
//!
//! It does NOT re-prove the underlying spend (that's `note_spending`'s
//! job). It is a *binding-only* AIR: it carries the typed bridge-action
//! parameters at full fidelity inside a STARK so the executor can check
//! that the bridge mint it is about to apply matches the proof's bytes
//! algebraically, not just by ad-hoc structural comparison in plaintext.
//!
//! Combined with `note_spending`'s Merkle/nullifier/key proof, the pair of
//! AIRs (spend + action) gives the executor algebraic guarantees on:
//! - Knowledge of the spending key (spending AIR)
//! - Merkle membership of the spent note (spending AIR)
//! - 248-bit-strength binding to nullifier / recipient / destination_federation
//!   (this AIR)
//! - Full 64-bit amount binding (this AIR)
