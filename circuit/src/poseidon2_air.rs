//! Compatibility surface for Poseidon2 proof witnesses.
//!
//! The former structs in this module advertised Rust-authored AIRs. They had no
//! remaining constraint implementation or callers, and are retired. Standalone
//! arity-2 hashing now consumes the descriptor emitted by
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.Poseidon2HashEmit`; Merkle membership is re-exported from
//! the witness-only DSL helpers and is proved through the emitted IR2 descriptor
//! in [`crate::merkle_air`].
