//! Canonical action-binding commitment for STARK proofs.
//!
//! This module defines the single authoritative function for computing the
//! binding commitment that ties a STARK proof to the (action, resource) pair
//! it authorizes. All three layers (prover, wire verifier, turn verifier) MUST
//! use this function to ensure they agree on what the proof is bound to.
//!
//! The binding domain is `(action, resource)` — the semantically meaningful
//! parts of an authorization request. Anti-replay fields (nonce, timestamp)
//! are NOT part of the binding because they change between requests for the
//! same authorization and the proof cannot be bound to values that don't exist
//! at proving time.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! The binding commitment uses 4 BabyBear field elements (124 bits), providing
//! a birthday bound of ~2^62. This follows the same pattern as
//! `AccumulatedHash` in ivc.rs. A single BabyBear element (~31 bits) would only
//! give ~2^15.5 collision resistance, which is uncomfortably low even though
//! exploiting a collision requires a valid token for the colliding action.
