//! `dregg-dyck-parse-v1`: the *parse-as-derivation* circuit
//! (`docs/DESIGN-parse-as-derivation.md`, the zk-succinct path).
//!
//! This is the depth-bounded pushdown-stack extension of the deployed inter-row
//! chain pattern. It is authored **line-for-line on the template**
//! `crate::dsl::dfa_routing` (`dfa_routing_descriptor`): a threaded state column via
//! `ConstraintExpr::Transition`, a `ChainedHash2to1` running commitment PI-seeded
//! with `SeedHash2to1`, and a rule-membership check. The generalization the design
//! names is: **thread `D` stack cells instead of one `CURRENT_STATE`, and let the
//! "transition table" be the grammar's rule table.**
//!
//! # What it proves
//!
//! A trace satisfying this descriptor IS an accepting **leftmost pushdown replay**
//! (`Dregg2.Crypto.CfgCompact.Replay`) of the one-bracket **Dyck** grammar
//! `S → [ S ] | ε` (`CfgCompact.lean` `Reference`: `dyck`, rules `rBracket`/`rEmpty`)
//! on its input word, with the parse's per-step commitments folded into a public
//! `route_commitment`.
//!
//! # Slice 2: the variable-length RHS push with a remainder shift
//!
//! Slice 1 wrote `rBracket`'s push as `next.STACK[0..3] = (op, S, cl)` and **ignored
//! the stack below the popped `S`**. That was sound only while the remainder was
//! empty — true for `"[]"`, false the moment a bracket nests under un-consumed stack.
//! This slice implements the general form (`docs/DESIGN-parse-as-derivation.md` §2,
//! hard-part #3): a production with RHS length `L` pops one cell and writes
//!
//! ```text
//!   next.STACK[j] = rhs[j]                  for j < L          (the pushed RHS)
//!   next.STACK[j] = local.STACK[j - (L-1)]  for L ≤ j < D      (the REMAINDER SHIFT)
//!   local.STACK[i] == 0                     for i ≥ D - (L-1)  (the OVERFLOW GUARD)
//! ```
//!
//! The remainder shift is what makes a nested word verify: `"[[]]"`'s second
//! `rBracket` fires with `cl` still sitting under the popped `S`, and that `cl` must
//! reappear beneath the pushed RHS or the closing bracket has nothing to match.
//!
//! The overflow guard is the honest statement of the depth bound: a push whose
//! remainder does not fit in the `D`-wide buffer **REJECTS**. It never silently drops
//! a symbol — dropping is exactly the slice-1 unsoundness, and the guard converts it
//! into a refusal.
//!
//! # Stack sizing (honest)
//!
//! Stack cells hold **symbol ids**; `0` is the reserved EMPTY cell. The `rBracket`
//! spike pushes three symbols for one popped `S`, so bracket-nesting `k` bounds the
//! stack at depth `2k + 1`. `D = 5` therefore covers `k ≤ 2` — enough for both
//! bundled witnesses: `"[]"` (peak 3) and `"[[]]"` (peak 4). A word needing more
//! nesting than `D` allows is not mis-proved; it fails the overflow guard.
//!
//! # Symbol / rule encoding
//!
//! `S = 1` (the sole nonterminal), `op = '[' = 2`, `cl = ']' = 3`.
//! Rule ids: `0 = none` (term/done rows), `rBracket = 1` (`S → [ S ]`),
//! `rEmpty = 2` (`S → ε`).
//!
//! # What is still out of slice
//!
//! The Lean inductive refinement (`parse_sat_imp_replay` — a satisfying trace
//! *implies* a `CfgCompact.Replay`) is slice 3. So is the depth↔occupancy invariant
//! (nothing yet ties `STACK_DEPTH` to *which* cells are nonzero); the boundaries, the
//! per-action depth deltas, and the depth range pin the depth's VALUE on every row, not
//! the identity of the occupied cells.
//!
//! # The depth range (the field-congruence hole, closed)
//!
//! The four depth deltas (`+2`/`−1`/`−1`/`0`) are polynomial gates, hence FIELD
//! congruences: on their own they pin `STACK_DEPTH` mod `p` and nothing more, so a depth
//! of `p − 1` reads as `−1` and a run could push past `D` and wrap. The two
//! [`vanishing_on_grid`] pins `∏_{v=0}^{D} (depth − v) == 0` on `STACK_DEPTH` and
//! `DEPTH_NEXT` are the design's `0 ≤ STACK_DEPTH ≤ D` column property emitted as a real
//! constraint: over a field the degree-`(D+1)` product vanishes at exactly the `D + 1`
//! grid points, so an off-grid (wrapped, negative, or overflowing) depth REJECTS.
//! `circuit-prove/tests/dyck_parse_tamper.rs` fires a `p − 1` depth at the tooth and
//! watches it bite.

///   `Gated` equalities, the shape of the design §2 `rule`/`term` teeth).
/// - **stack threading** (the heart) — the multi-cell generalization of
///   `dfa_routing`'s single `Transition{CURRENT_STATE ← NEXT_STATE}`
///   (`dfa_routing.rs:173`): `rBracket` fires [`push_with_remainder_shift`] with

/// - **running commitment** — `ENTRY_HASH == hash_4_to_1(RULE_ID, STACK0,
