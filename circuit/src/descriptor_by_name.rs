//! **`descriptor_by_name`** — the descriptor-world analog of
//! [`crate::dsl::descriptors::circuit_for_air_name`] (Foundation 1).
//!
//! The StarkProof→descriptor-prover migration replaces the runtime AIR-name → `DslCircuit`
//! dispatch (`circuit_for_air_name`, a match over v1 `CircuitDescriptor` circuits) with a
//! dispatch into the IR-v2 descriptor world: each predicate kind's proof is re-expressed as an
//! [`EffectVmDescriptor2`] proven through [`crate::descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2`] and
//! checked by [`crate::descriptor_ir2::verify_vm_descriptor2`]. This module is the production
//! dispatch table for that world.
//!
//! ## The #1 migration danger this closes
//!
//! A wrong or MISSING dispatch arm is a SILENT verify failure: the consumer that cannot find a
//! descriptor for a predicate must NEVER fall through to "accept". So [`descriptor_by_name`]
//! returns [`Option::None`] on a miss — never a stand-in descriptor, never a silent accept — and
//! every mapped name is covered by the round-trip test below (name → descriptor → decode →
//! well-formedness; and, for the membership family, real prove → verify).
//!
//! ## The predicate-kind → descriptor map (ground-truthed from the migration scout)
//!
//! | [`PredicateKind`] | descriptor(s) ([`descriptor_names_for_kind`])                          |
//! |-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Dfa`             | `dfa-routing-toggle-2state::poseidon2-v1` (DfaRouting)                  |
//! | `Temporal`        | `dregg-temporal-predicate-gte::dsl-v1` (TemporalPredicate)             |
//! | `MerkleMembership`| `merkle-membership-depth2-4ary::poseidon2-v1` + the depth-GENERAL builder |
//! | `NonMembership`   | `dregg-membership-adjacency::poseidon2-v1` + `quantified-absence-…`     |
//! | `BlindedSet`      | `dregg-non-revocation-sorted-tree::poseidon2-v1` + `dregg-accumulator-nonrev-emit-v2` |
//! | `BridgePredicate` | `bridge-action-leaf::bridge_action_air_v1` + `dregg-predicate-arith-ge::threshold-v1` |
//! | `Custom`          | `dregg-effectvm-custom-v1` (customVmDescriptor2)                        |
//! | `PedersenEquality`| NONE — off-STARK Schnorr, no descriptor (returns `&[]` / `None`)        |
//!
//! ## Where the descriptors come from (byte-pinned)
//!
//! Each predicate descriptor is emitted from Lean (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*Emit.lean`)
//! and byte-pinned there by an `emitVmJson2` `#guard`. The consts below `include_str!` the
//! checked-in `circuit/descriptors/by-name/*.json` files and decode them via
//! [`crate::descriptor_ir2::parse_vm_descriptor2`].
//!
//! What ties those files to the Lean is `EmitByName.lean` + `scripts/emit-descriptors.sh`: every
//! by-name descriptor is now RE-DERIVED from its Lean author on each drift-check run
//! (`scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh`), and `scripts/emit_descriptors.py`'s coverage check
//! recurses into `by-name/`, so a file no emitter reproduces is a routing-gap failure. This closed
//! a real hole: the by-name goldens used to reach disk by an UNGATED hand transcription of the Lean
//! `#guard` string, and `predicate-arith.json` had drifted through it to a 5-wide re-authoring with
//! both Poseidon2 weld legs missing — a deployed, demonstrated forgery. The route now forbids that
//! divergence; the falsifier is `circuit/tests/predicate_arith_fact_weld_canary.rs`.
//!
//! The depth-general Merkle membership is built by [`membership_descriptor_of_depth`]
//! (Foundation 2), not parsed.
