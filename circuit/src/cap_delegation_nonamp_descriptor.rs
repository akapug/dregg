//! # `cap_delegation_nonamp_descriptor` — the GENUINE-NON-AMP cap-graph descriptor loader.
//!
//! The ARGUS linchpin on the DELEGATION family (`delegate`, `delegateAtten`, `attenuate`, `introduce`,
//! `revoke`, `refresh`). One Lean-verified `EffectVmDescriptor` that, on a cap-graph row, enforces BOTH:
//!
//!   * **genuine cap-root recompute** — `new_cap_root = hash[edge_leaf, old_cap_root]` with
//!     `edge_leaf = hash[holder, target, rights, op]` (the §G prepend-accumulator advance, op-tagged), so
//!     the post `cap_root` is a FORCED function of the bound cap-edge mutation, not an opaque digest
//!     parameter — and the recomputed root is absorbed into `state_commit` (tamper ⇒ UNSAT);
//!   * **per-bit non-amplification** — the submask gates force `granted_bit ≤ held_bit` on each of the
//!     8 delegation bit carriers (`dcol.grantedBit i` = col 128+i, `dcol.heldBit i` = col 120+i). An
//!     over-grant (a granted bit set where the held bit is clear) fails the submask gate. Both legs are
//!     emitted from the proved Lean module and both are witnessed behaviourally by the tests below.
//!
//! ## ⚠ THE TWO LEGS DO NOT INTERLOCK — the emitted gates bind the WRONG columns (2026-07-15)
//!
//! This module's header USED to claim: "the per-bit submask gates … over the **SAME `rights` felt** the
//! recompute hashes into the edge leaf", and "the two legs INTERLOCK on one `rights` felt: tamper it to
//! dodge the submask gate and the recomputed `cap_root` moves ⇒ UNSAT". **That is false as emitted**, and
//! the committed JSON is the witness — read the two mask-reconstruction gates:
//!
//! ```text
//! gate 54:  v7 − Σ_{i<8} v(120+i)·2ⁱ     (held mask recon)
//! gate 55:  v4 − Σ_{i<8} v(128+i)·2ⁱ     (granted mask recon)
//! ```
//!
//! The granted bits reconstruct **column 4**, and the held bits **column 7**. The `rights` felt the
//! edge-leaf site hashes is **column 72**. Columns 4 and 7 are EFFECT-SELECTOR columns (the selector
//! block is `0..54`); they are not the rights param and nothing else in the descriptor relates them to it.
//!
//! The cause is a param-index/column conflation in the Lean emit. `EffectVmEmitCapReshape.dcol.GRANTED_MASK
//! := EffectVmEmitCapRoot.cp.RIGHTS`, and `cp.RIGHTS = 4` is a **param INDEX** — the column is
//! `prmCol 4 = PARAM_BASE + 4 = 72`. But `gMaskRecon` consumes a raw COLUMN (`eCol maskCol`), so the
//! emitted gate reads `v4`. `dcol.HELD_MASK := 7` has the same shape (intended param 7 = col 75; emitted
//! `v7`). The mint-flavour `col.HELD_MASK`/`col.SLOT`/`col.TARGET` in the same namespace are built the
//! same way, so `cap_reshape_descriptor` is very likely to carry the identical defect.
//!
//! What survives: `capDeleg_nonAmp_in_circuit` / `capDeleg_rejects_amplify` are PROVED and TRUE — they
//! quantify over `dcol.grantedBit i` / `dcol.heldBit i`, which really are cols 128+i / 120+i, and the
//! submask gate really does force `gᵢ ≤ hᵢ` there. `nonamp_submask_gate_refuses_an_amplifying_witness`
//! witnesses that behaviourally. What does NOT survive is the LINK from those bits to the rights the
//! recomputed `cap_root` commits. The Lean doc-comment on `capDeleg_nonAmp_in_circuit` asserts that link
//! ("Since the granted bits reconstruct `cp.RIGHTS` … this binds the very rights the recomputed
//! `cap_root` commits") and it is not what the emit produces.
//!
//! `nonamp_leg_does_not_bind_the_hashed_rights_felt` PINS this behaviourally, so the defect cannot be
//! silently inherited: it proves an amplifying `rights` felt is ACCEPTED. **That test is designed to go
//! RED when the emit is fixed** — that red is the signal the fix landed, not a regression.
//!
//! A second, independent emit defect on the same descriptor: its state-commit site's `Digest k` indices
//! were never rebased when the two cap-root sites were PREPENDED to the site list. Site 5 (`digest_col`
//! 88 = `state_commit`) reads digests `0,1,2` = cols `102, 87, 98` — the edge leaf, the cap root, and
//! `hash[state_after[0..3]]` — where the GROUP-4 chain intends cols `98, 99, 100`. So `state_after[4..10]`
//! (cols 80..86) are NOT committed by `state_commit`, and sites 3/4 (cols 99/100) are dead carriers.
//! `state_commit_group4_chain_is_misindexed` pins it. All 27 other emitted descriptors index correctly;
//! this one is unique — the prepend shifted the ordinals and the `Digest k` literals stayed.
//!
//! Neither defect is live: nothing routes to this descriptor (see NOT WIRED below). Both must be fixed in
//! the Lean emit — `prmCol`-wrapping the mask columns and rebasing the digest ordinals — then re-emitted
//! (`scripts/emit-descriptors.sh`), re-pinned (`GENUINE_NONAMP_FP`), and drift-gated. That work is Lean-side
//! and out of scope for the test lane that found it; it is in HORIZONLOG.
//!
//! ## Provenance (anti-drift, the LAW#1 way)
//!
//! `dregg-effectvm-attenuateA-v1-genuine-nonamp.json` is the **byte-exact** output of the verified Lean
//! emit `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitAttenuateA.attenuateVmDescriptorGenuineNonAmp` (via
//! `emitVmJson`, the `EmitAllJson` registry line). The Rust prover INTERPRETS this descriptor via
//! `parse_vm_descriptor` (it AUTHORS NO CONSTRAINT — the gates are emitted from the proved Lean module:
//! `capDeleg_nonAmp_in_circuit` / `capDeleg_rejects_amplify` are the in-circuit teeth, both polarities).
//! The test below re-parses the JSON into the prover's structure; the Lean↔JSON drift gate is
//! generate-fresh `scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh` (`GENUINE_NONAMP_FP` is a cache-freshness pin,
//! NOT a faithfulness check). ONE descriptor object backs all six effects (the `op` tag distinguishes the mutation,
//! so the JSON is shared — selector→JSON fan-out, like the v1 cap-graph face).
//!
//! This is a STANDALONE loader (its own module + test), NOT registered in the locked
//! `effect_vm_descriptors` registry (whose count assertions would otherwise break) — exactly as
//! `cap_reshape_descriptor` is standalone.
//!
//! ## ⚠ NOT WIRED — this descriptor is dead code at HEAD (named seam, 2026-07-15)
//!
//! Nothing routes cap-graph rows to this descriptor. `GENUINE_NONAMP_NAME` / `GENUINE_NONAMP_JSON`
//! have **zero consumers** outside this module and its own test; the delegation family proves under
//! the opaque-digest `attenuateA` face instead. So the in-circuit teeth described above are real and
//! Lean-verified, but they do **not** gate any deployed proof: the good descriptor is dead while the
//! weaker one is deployed.
//!
//! Closing this needs a selector→JSON dispatcher that routes the six cap-graph effects here (or a
//! decision to delete both standalone cap loaders). The closure lane is
//! `docs/deos/CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN.md` §4 MOVE 5 ("resolve the cap-descriptor orphans — do not
//! leave the good one dead and the weak one deployed").
//!
//! ⚠ HORIZONLOG's "cap-crown IR non-amp LANDED, 2026-06-15" entry still describes the two legs as
//! INTERLOCKING on one `rights` felt. That claim is false as emitted (see above) and the entry is
//! owed a correction; it is not swept here because that file is mid-flight in another lane.
