//! Generalized effect-action binding AIR.
//!
//! Sibling AIR to `bridge_action_witness`. The bridge AIR established the pattern:
//! a 32-byte field becomes 8 BabyBear limbs (4 bytes each), a u64 amount
//! becomes 2 BabyBear limbs (low/high 32 bits), and each limb is pinned to a
//! trace-row-0 column via a boundary constraint. Transition constraints force
//! every row to equal row 0, so a malicious prover cannot put one set of
//! parameters in row 0 and another in row 1 to slip past the boundary check.
//!
//! `bridge_action_witness` ships a *fixed* schema (nullifier + recipient +
//! destination_federation + amount). This module generalizes the same shape to
//! an arbitrary list of named 32-byte fields and named u64 amounts, so each
//! `Effect` variant can have its parameters bound at full fidelity without
//! authoring a new AIR per variant.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Given a schema with `N` 32-byte fields and `M` u64 amounts, the column /
//! PI layout is:
//!
//! ```text
//! col / PI 0..8           field[0] limbs        (8 × 4-byte BabyBear)
//! col / PI 8..16          field[1] limbs
//! ...
//! col / PI 8N             amount[0] low 32 bits
//! col / PI 8N + 1         amount[0] high 32 bits
//! col / PI 8N + 2         amount[1] low 32 bits
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! Total trace width = 8N + 2M. Total PI count = 8N + 2M. Each PI slot
//! corresponds 1:1 with a row-0 boundary constraint on the same column.
//!
//! # Why a generalized AIR rather than one-per-effect?
//!
//! The bridge-action AIR is its own module for historical / dispatch reasons
//! (the bridge wire format references the proof shape by name). For
//! subsequent effects we factor: one AIR with a per-effect *schema*, and
//! per-effect *witness builders* in this same module. Each effect's
//! `prove_X_binding` / `verify_X_binding` pair uses the same AIR with a
//! different schema. The AIR's `air_name` mixes in the effect kind so the
//! Fiat-Shamir transcript domain-separates different effect kinds (a proof
//! generated for effect A cannot replay as effect B even with the same
//! parameter bytes).
//!
//! # What this AIR does and does NOT do
//!
//! Does: full-fidelity binding of typed parameters into the proof's PI.
//! Tampering on any byte of any 32-byte field, or any bit of any u64 amount,
//! produces a different limb encoding which mismatches the boundary
//! constraint, which fails STARK verification.
//!
//! Does NOT: replay protection, ledger-state consistency, cross-effect
//! ordering, or anything specific to an effect's *semantics*. Those live one
//! layer up (executor / Effect-VM / per-effect side proofs).

/// Schema for `Burn` binding (AIR-SOUNDNESS-AUDIT.md #75).
///
/// Pre-#75 the Burn effect was structural-only: the executor enforced
/// `old_balance >= amount` and decremented the balance in
/// `executor/apply.rs::Effect::Burn`, but no AIR algebraic constraint
/// witnessed the arithmetic. A malicious executor producing a forged
/// receipt could claim any `(old, new, amount)` triple consistent with
/// the recorded balance commitments, since the proof did not pin the
/// arithmetic relation.
///
/// fields = [target_cell_id (32B)]
/// amounts = [old_balance (u64), new_balance (u64), amount (u64),
///            was_burn_flag (u64; constrained to 1)]
///
/// Algebraic constraints (see `AlgebraicConstraint::Burn`):
///   1. `new_balance == old_balance - amount` (two-limb u64 subtraction
///      with a boolean borrow witness)
///   2. `was_burn_flag == 1` (binding the disclosure into PI; the
///      receipt's `was_burn` flag is independently absorbed into
///      `Turn::hash`, this AIR slot closes the loop so a verifier can
///      algebraically attribute the burn disclosure to a specific
///      receipt)
///   3. Borrow bit is boolean (`borrow * (borrow - 1) == 0`)
///
/// The `old_balance >= amount` predicate is enforced by the executor's
/// `InsufficientBalance` runtime check; the AIR binds the arithmetic at
/// the limb level. Golden-Vision adds bit-decomp range checks to close
/// the residual algebraic gap.
///
/// `slot` is not bound here because Silver-Vision rejects any slot other
/// than the canonical balance slot (`0`); see the executor's apply check.
/// Once Burn is extended to multi-slot, add a `slot (u64)` amount to the
/// schema.
