//! **THE CUSTOM-PROOF STATE-BINDING ABI** — the canonical public-input prefix that
//! makes a custom sub-proof provably ABOUT a specific cell-state transition.
//!
//! ## The gap this closes
//!
//! `Effect::Custom` binds two things into the EffectVM's public inputs
//! (`pi::CUSTOM_PROOFS_BASE + i*16`): the sub-program's `vk_hash` (8 felts) and a
//! `custom_proof_commitment` (8 felts) = [`custom_proof_pi_commitment_8`] over the
//! sub-proof's public inputs. The deployed fold
//! (`dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_segmented`)
//! `connect`s that CLAIMED commitment, lane by lane, to the commitment the custom leaf
//! computes IN-CIRCUIT from the sub-proof's REAL public inputs — so a claimed commitment
//! no verifying sub-proof backs is UNSAT.
//!
//! That chain binds **which public inputs the sub-proof used**. It does NOT bind what
//! those public inputs SAY. The commitment is an opaque hash: nothing required the
//! sub-proof's PIs to mention the cell's pre-state or post-state at all. So a custom AIR
//! could prove a beautiful transition `R1 -> R2` while the turn commits `S1 -> S2`, with
//! `R1 != S1` and `R2 != S2`, and every existing gate passed. The custom proof verified;
//! it was simply not ABOUT the state the turn committed.
//!
//! ## The ABI
//!
//! A state-binding custom proof's public inputs are, by construction:
//!
//! ```text
//!   pis[0..8]   = the cell's PRE-state  commitment (the leg's tail PI [n-16..n-8))
//!   pis[8..16]  = the cell's POST-state commitment (the leg's tail PI [n-8..n))
//!   pis[16..]   = application-specific (the game's board roots, move seals, …)
//! ```
//!
//! **WHICH 8-felt commitment (read this — two different values in this system are both
//! called "the commitment"):** the prefix is the deployed **v9 CHIP commit** —
//! `dregg_cell::commitment::bytes32_to_felt8` of the stored/claimed 32-byte commitment,
//! i.e. `compute_canonical_state_commitment_v9_felt8` = `wire_commit_8_chip` over the
//! cell's 178 rotated pre-limbs + iroot (the byte-twin of the circuit's `fill_wide_block`).
//! That is the value the executor holds, the value the WIDE leg publishes in its LAST 16
//! descriptor PIs, and the value the in-circuit fold connects against.
//!
//! It is **NOT** `CellState::compute_commitment_8`, and **NOT** the EffectVM
//! `PI[OLD_COMMIT_BASE..+8]` / `PI[NEW_COMMIT_BASE..+8]` prefix slots. That legacy
//! bundle-path commitment is a 5-node `hash_4_to_1` tree over
//! `balance/nonce/fields[8]/cap_root/record_digest` — a different function over a strict
//! SUBSET of the limbs, with no cells_root, no map roots, no iroot. The two values are not
//! two encodings of one commitment and can never be equal; nothing pins them to each other.
//! (This doc previously named those two — the prose had drifted from the wire. The
//! executor's comparands, below, are and were the v9 chip commit.)
//!
//! ## Why the prefix rides for free
//!
//! [`custom_proof_pi_commitment_8`] hashes the WHOLE public-input vector. So the moment
//! the state roots are IN the PIs, they are already covered by the commitment the
//! `Effect::Custom` row carries and the fold binds in-circuit. No new EffectVM PI slot, no
//! new trace column, no descriptor change, no VK rotation — the binding surface already
//! exists; this module fixes what MUST occupy its preimage.
//!
//! ## The two teeth (and their exact reach)
//!
//! 1. **Off-AIR, executor (LANDED here):**
//!    `dregg_turn::executor::proof_verify::TurnExecutor::enforce_custom_proof_state_binding`
//!    recomputes [`custom_proof_pi_commitment_8`] over the wire sub-proof's PIs and
//!    requires (a) it equals the in-circuit-committed `custom_proof_commitment`, and
//!    (b) the PI prefix equals the turn's OLD/NEW state commitments. This is what an
//!    EXECUTOR (and any re-executing validator) enforces.
//!
//! 2. **In-circuit, fold (LANDED — and the DEPLOYED DEFAULT):** the dual-expose leg leaf
//!    carries the descriptor-bound REAL roots in its exposed segment
//!    (`ivc_turn_chain::SEG_FIRST_OLD` lanes `0..8`, `SEG_LAST_NEW` lanes `8..16`). The
//!    custom leaf's `expose_claim` is widened from `[commitment(8)]` to
//!    `[commitment(8) ‖ pis[0..16]]`
//!    (`dregg_circuit_prove::custom_leaf_adapter::prove_custom_leaf_with_state_commitment`),
//!    and `dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_state_segmented`
//!    `connect`s those 16 lanes to the leg's segment lanes. The deployed chain prover
//!    (`ivc_turn_chain::prove_chain_core_rotated`'s Custom arm) mints THAT pair — so a
//!    custom sub-proof whose declared roots are not the leg's real rotated roots has no
//!    satisfying partner: UNSAT, no root, and the light client never receives a verifying
//!    artifact.
//!
//! A PURE LIGHT CLIENT (folding only the recursion tree, never re-running the executor) now
//! witnesses BOTH "a sub-proof backs this commitment" AND "its PIs are this cell's roots".
//!
//! The two teeth are deliberately kept, and they are not redundant: tooth 1 refuses the
//! turn at admission (cheap, before any STARK), tooth 2 makes the refusal a property of the
//! ARTIFACT rather than of the verifier's diligence. Tooth 2 is not a conditional gate —
//! the state node REQUIRES the 24-lane claim, so a prover cannot dodge it by minting the
//! narrow leaf.
//!
//! **The ABI is now load-bearing on the prover side.** A sub-program publishing fewer than
//! `CUSTOM_PI_STATE_PREFIX_LEN` PIs is refused by the deployed prover, exactly as it was
//! already refused by the deployed executor. A custom carrier must publish the prefix.
