//! `dregg-circuit`: Zero-knowledge proof circuits for dregg authorization token chains.
//!
//! # ⚠️ dregg1 hand-written AIRs vs the verified dregg2 descriptor path
//!
//! Most AIRs in this crate are **hand-written, UNVERIFIED dregg1 circuits**.
//! They are NOT the source of truth. The verified circuit semantics live in
//! Lean under `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/` — 52 per-effect descriptor
//! instances (`Inst/*.lean`), each with a full-state soundness keystone over
//! ALL kernel-state fields, grounded on the single named `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
//! hypothesis (kernel-clean: `lake build` green, `#assert_namespace_axioms`
//! whitelisting only `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`).
//!
//! The Lean is verified at the **digest / state-transition layer**; it
//! abstracts Poseidon2 / Merkle / selector-dispatch as a hypothesis. The
//! hand-written AIRs here (`effect_vm/`, `note_spending_air`, `poseidon2_air`,
//! `effect_action_air`) are the layer that actually computes those hashes /
//! Merkle paths in-circuit — a DIFFERENT abstraction layer, not a competing
//! implementation. They retire one FRONTIER at a time as the Lean-emitted
//! descriptor interpreter (`lean_descriptor_air`) gains hash / limb / dispatch
//! gates. Do NOT duplicate or hand-extend a circuit without checking whether the
//! verified Lean descriptor already covers the statement; see
//! `metatheory/docs/rebuild/_RUST-CIRCUIT-CONSOLIDATION.md` and
//! `_DREGG1-DREGG2-UNIFICATION-LEDGER.md`. Dead/duplicate AIRs get deleted, not
//! kept (already gone: `effect_interp`, `garbled_air_p3`).
//!
//! # Trust Model
//!
//! This crate operates at the **TRUSTLESS** trust level.
//!
//! - **Soundness**: All proofs are independently verifiable by any party with access to
//!   the public inputs and verification key. A valid proof guarantees that the prover
//!   knows a witness satisfying the circuit constraints, up to the FRI soundness error
//!   ledgered below.
//! - **Assumptions**: Cryptographic hardness of the hash function (BLAKE3/Poseidon2),
//!   correct circuit constraint encoding, and honest verifier randomness (Fiat-Shamir).
//!   No trust in any federation member, operator, or third party.
//! - **Verifiable by**: Anyone. Proofs are publicly verifiable with O(log n) verification
//!   time. Light clients, external auditors, and cross-federation peers can all verify
//!   independently.
//!
//! ## The FRI soundness ledger — the deployed numbers
//!
//! There is no `2^{-128}` here — and there is no single per-fold number for this system
//! either. The ledger is **PARAMETRIC and LEAN-OWNED**: `Dregg2.Circuit.FriLedger.friLedger
//! : FriParams → Ledger` is a computable Lean function, `@[export dregg_fri_ledger]`-ed, and
//! `circuit-prove/tests/fri_params_soundness_budget.rs` CALLS it for each of the **7**
//! shipped configs. Rust derives none of these figures — it marshals knobs in and reports
//! columns out. (Its predecessor re-typed the formulas in Rust; that twin is deleted.)
//!
//! One parametric theorem justifies every row — `FriLedgerSound.ledger_perFold_soundness`,
//! instantiating `FriArityTransfer.good_card_le_of_phase_injective` at each config's arity
//! `m = 2^max_log_arity` and folded domain `|κ| = 2^log_blowup`. The three columns:
//!
//! - **per-fold bits — PROVEN, and per-config.** The proximity-gap error exponent:
//!   `|Good| ≤ (m−1)·C(|κ|,2)` over the challenge field `|F| = babyBearP^ext_deg ≈ 2^123.6`.
//!   It is **structure-specific and config-specific** — not a bound on FRI in general, and
//!   not one number for the system:
//!   * `ir2_config` — **the DEPLOYED wrap** — folds at arity **8**: `|Good| ≤ 7·C(64,2) =
//!     14112`, giving **109 bits** (`FriArityTransfer.arity8_perFold_soundness`). The
//!     often-quoted ~112.6 is proved for a 2-to-1 fold the deployed prover does NOT run;
//!     `log₂ 7 ≈ 2.807` bits is the price of the arity-8 moment curve.
//!   * `ir2_leaf_wrap_config` (arity 2 at `log_blowup 6`) is the ONE shipped config ~112.6
//!     describes: `|Good| ≤ C(64,2) = 2016` ⇒ **112 bits**.
//!   * v1 `create_config` / `create_zk_config`: **116**. `create_outer_config` (**the config
//!     the gnark ETH-wrap verifies**) / its GPU twin / `create_recursion_config`: **118**.
//!   ⚑ per-fold RISES as `log_blowup` FALLS, and that is NOT an upgrade — a smaller folded
//!   domain has fewer pairs, hence fewer good challenges. The rate is paid for in the QUERY
//!   ledger below. The columns are independent (`query_ledger_does_not_determine_perFold`):
//!   never multiply them into one figure.
//!   ⚑ Every per-fold number rests on the `M = 1` fiber bound, carried as the per-config
//!   HYPOTHESIS `hΦ` by the arity-generic count. It is now DISCHARGED from farness at ALL
//!   six shipped configs by `Dregg2.Circuit.FriArityFiberDischarge.phase_injective_of_far`
//!   (deployed arity 8: `arity8_phase_injective`, `dOut ≥ 496`), which builds the
//!   arity-`2^k` rate-`2^(−b)` RS setups the tree previously lacked. `#assert_axioms` is
//!   blind to hypotheses — the discharge is a theorem, not an axiom-check result.
//! - **Johnson bits — proven for any code.** The list-decoding-to-√rate figure,
//!   `num_queries × log_blowup / 2 + query_pow_bits`. `73` on six shipped configs; **`71` on
//!   `create_recursion_config`**, whose `14` query-PoW bits make it the weakest shipped
//!   config and set the gate's floor (`recursion_config_is_the_weakest_link`).
//! - **capacity bits — REFUTED; a knob-drift baseline, NOT a security claim.** The
//!   up-to-`1−ρ` arithmetic `num_queries × log_blowup + query_pow_bits` that production
//!   STARKs historically quote. The conjecture it rests on is **refuted** for coset
//!   Reed–Solomon at rates covering our `ρ = 1/64` (Kambiré, eprint 2025/2046). The gate's
//!   `≥ 128` check is a conservative ENGINEERING MARGIN on this refuted arithmetic — drift
//!   detection only, not a proof and not a claim that 128 bits are achieved. `130` on six
//!   configs; **exactly `128` — zero headroom — on `create_recursion_config`**.
//! - **Caps.** All figures are additionally capped by the degree-4 BabyBear extension
//!   (~2^124 challenge space) and the Poseidon2 commitment hash. Every figure sits under it.
//!
//! The v1 and IR-v2 configs share a QUERY ledger, and the gate asserts that parity: v1
//! [`plonky3_prover::create_config`] at `(log_blowup 3, 38 queries, 16 PoW)` and IR-v2
//! `descriptor_ir2::ir2_config` at `(6, 19, 16)` each give capacity `130` / Johnson `73`
//! (proved: `FriLedgerSound.wrap_prodV1_query_ledger_parity`). The `(6, 19)` pin is the
//! measured size-optimal point AT that parity. ⚑ They do NOT share a per-fold posture
//! (109 vs 116) — the parity is a fact about two columns, not about "the ledger".
//!
//! The counting bounds are sound against Kambiré's refutation: his `n^C` blow-up needs
//! `n → ∞` and `r > 2`; at our fixed `r = 2` his own construction caps at `C(n,2)`.
//!
//! All code in this crate MUST maintain the property that a valid proof implies a valid
//! witness. Bugs here break the entire trust model -- a soundness bug allows forged
//! authorization tokens.
//!
//! This crate implements the circuit layer for the dregg ZK token system,
//! proving: "I hold a valid attenuated token chain whose final state authorizes
//! action X" without revealing the chain or capabilities.

//! # Features
//!
//! - `plonky3` (default, always-on no-op): retained so the existing
//!   `#[cfg(feature = "plonky3")]` sites resolve true on the verify floor. Every p3
//!   dependency of this crate is non-optional — `dregg-circuit` IS the prover-free
//!   batch-STARK verify surface plus the recursion-free `prove_batch` provers. Turning
//!   this off does not remove Plonky3. See `Cargo.toml`'s split-policy note.
//!
//! There is no `mock` feature. The old `verifier` / `prover` features are gone: their
//! items are now unconditional or moved to `dregg-circuit-prove`, which owns the
//! recursion tower (`cargo tree -p dregg-circuit` is recursion-free, and that is
//! load-bearing).
//!
//! # Proof Backends
//!
//! - [`plonky3_prover`]: the deployed Plonky3 STARK prover/verifier (FRI + Poseidon2
//!   Merkle + Fiat-Shamir), including the production FRI knobs (`PROD_FRI_*`) the
//!   soundness ledger above is computed from.
//! - [`descriptor_ir2`]: the IR-v2 descriptor interpreter and its deployed FRI config
//!   (`IR2_FRI_*`) — the path a light client verifies against.
//! - [`lean_descriptor_air`]: parses a Lean-emitted `EffectVmDescriptor` and rebuilds
//!   the AIR from the descriptor alone (the prover authors no constraint).
//! - [`constraint_prover`]: constraint satisfaction checker that validates circuit
//!   logic by evaluating AIR constraints directly on the execution trace. It generates
//!   no cryptographic proof — it is a development/testing oracle, not a backend a
//!   verifier trusts.
//!
//! # Security Properties
//!
//! The circuit enforces:
//! 1. **Fact membership**: Every referenced fact exists in the committed Merkle tree.
//! 2. **Valid narrowing**: Each attenuation step only removes facts or adds checks.
//! 3. **Derivation correctness**: The authorization follows from the final state via valid rules.
//! 4. **Issuer accountability**: The token chain originates from a federated issuer.
//! 5. **Freshness**: The proof is bound to a specific timestamp.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - [`field`]: BabyBear field arithmetic (p = 2^31 - 1).
//! - [`poseidon2`]: SNARK-friendly hash function for in-circuit hashing.
//! - [`merkle_air`]: 4-ary Merkle membership proof circuit.
//! - [`constraint_prover`]: Constraint satisfaction evaluator (no cryptographic proof).
//! - [`plonky3_prover`]: the deployed STARK prover/verifier (FRI + Merkle + Fiat-Shamir).
//! - [`descriptor_ir2`] / [`lean_descriptor_air`]: the verified descriptor path.
//!
//! Hand-written dregg1 AIRs, retained and `#[deprecated]` — see the header warning above;
//! they are NOT the source of truth and retire one frontier at a time:
//! [`derivation_air`] (single Datalog derivation step), [`fold_air`] (attenuation step),
//! [`presentation`] (the composed presentation proof).

// ⚠ NOT YET DENIABLE — `#![deny(rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links)]` belongs here and does not
// fit yet (measured 2026-07-15, `CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN.md` §4 MOVE 4's last bullet). Turning it
// on today reds `cargo doc -p dregg-circuit` with **311** hits, of which ~187 are pure array
// notation rustdoc mis-parses as links (`[0]`, `[4..7]`) and most of the rest are prose in
// brackets (`[a]`, `[asset]`). Only a handful are genuine doc rot — the lint DID find one this
// sweep missed (`constraint_prover.rs`'s third live `[crate::stark]`, now dead). Landing the
// deny is a real lane (escape ~300 bracket spans), not a one-line add; shipping it red would
// just train readers to ignore `cargo doc`. Do it, but do it as its own lane.
