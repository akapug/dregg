//! Federation receipt with BLS threshold quorum certificate.
//!
//! Implements [`DESIGN-receipts.md`] §4: a typed receipt the federation
//! produces after committing a turn, carrying a constant-size BLS aggregate
//! signature over the receipt body. The receipt is the unit of
//! cross-federation evidence; it survives federation A → federation B
//! transmission without B knowing A's committee size.
//!
//! ## Threshold property
//!
//! The receipt's [`QuorumCertificate`] is one of two flavors:
//!
//! - [`ReceiptQc::Threshold`] — a single [`ThresholdQC`] (BLS aggregate over
//!   `body_hash_blake3(body)`). Constant size, O(1) verification, **strongly
//!   preferred** for cross-federation receipts.
//! - [`ReceiptQc::Votes`] — a fallback `(voter_id, Signature)` list signed by
//!   the federation's Ed25519 keys. O(n) verification. Used in solo mode and
//!   tests where the BLS hints setup is not initialized.
//!
//! Replacing the legacy forgeable-hash "signatures" used to live at the fast
//! path layer (R-5 in `EFFECT-VM-SHAPE-A.md`) with BLS thresholds at the
//! receipt layer makes the federation receipt cryptographically sound against
//! a committee with up to `n - threshold` corrupted members: anything below
//! threshold cannot produce a valid aggregate signature.
