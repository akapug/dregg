//! THE FRUSTUM / SNAPSHOT EDITOR — the share-with-attenuation surface.
//!
//! `docs/desktop-os-research/REHYDRATABLE-SURFACES.md`: a deos "screenshot" is a
//! **paused camera on a witnessed scene** behind a **membrane** — sharing it is
//! not "I leaked my session" but "I extended a revocable, attenuated, per-viewer
//! right to re-view". This module is the **pre-send editor** where you SCULPT that
//! share before it leaves your hands:
//!
//!   1. **Cull the frustum** — toggle which presentation lenses + which sub-objects
//!      (a cell's affordances) are IN the shared slice. Culling can only NARROW the
//!      boundary (a `cull_*` strictly shrinks the slice; the cull set starts FULL).
//!   2. **Pare the authority** — an [`AttenuationDial`] over the held window cap.
//!      The recipient gets only the rights the dial designates, validated by the
//!      REAL [`is_attenuation`] (`granted ⊆ held`): the dial REFUSES an amplifying
//!      choice IN-BAND ([`SnapshotEditor::pare_to`] surfaces the refusal), never
//!      silently widens.
//!   3. **Live verification** — as you edit, [`SnapshotEditor::verify`] reports
//!      whether the pare is a sound attenuation AND what a given recipient would
//!      ACTUALLY see (the membrane-projected preview = the REAL
//!      [`AffordanceSnapshot::rehydrate_for`] through the same `is_attenuation`).
//!   4. **Share** — [`SnapshotEditor::share`] produces the [`SharedArtifact`]: the
//!      culled [`UiSnapshot`] + the attenuated cap + the culled
//!      [`AffordanceSnapshot`] (the membrane scope) + a revocation handle. A
//!      `share()` that would amplify is REFUSED (returns the refusal); it is not
//!      possible to mint an over-wide artifact through this editor.
//!
//! ## The org-settings register (the familiar UX, the sound substrate)
//!
//! `REHYDRATABLE-SURFACES.md` "the membrane negotiation IS a GitHub-org settings
//! page": teams = capability groups · roles (read/triage/write/admin) = the
//! attenuation lattice · visibility = the projection/frustum scope · member mgmt =
//! grant/revoke. This editor IS that page for ONE shared slice: the frustum cull is
//! *visibility*, the attenuation dial is the *role*, the recipient preview is
//! *"what this member would see"*, and [`SharedArtifact::revoke`] is *removing the
//! member*. Familiar surface; under it, every primitive is the REAL one.
//!
//! ## Hard reuse (no reinvented attenuation, no reinvented snapshot)
//!
//!   * the SNAPSHOT is [`crate::ui_snapshot::UiSnapshot`] (the witness-cursor camera
//!     the live inspector already paused) — we carry it, we do not re-derive it;
//!   * the AFFORDANCE FRUSTUM is [`crate::affordance::AffordanceSnapshot`] +
//!     `rehydrate_for` (the per-viewer membrane projection through `is_attenuation`);
//!   * the ATTENUATION DIAL is [`crate::cap_inspector::AttenuationDial`] (which
//!     itself rides the REAL [`dregg_firmament::Capability::attenuate`] +
//!     [`is_attenuation`]) — the dial REFUSES a widening fail-closed;
//!   * the NO-AMPLIFICATION GATE is the GENUINE [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`],
//!     the same lattice the cap crown + the membrane prove.
//!
//! gpui-free + `cargo test`-able exactly as `ui_snapshot.rs`/`cap_inspector.rs` are.
