//! THE APP REGISTRY — pre-built starbridge-apps wired into the live cockpit.
//!
//! The census (`.docs-history-noclaude/deos/APP-AND-FEDERATION-CENSUS-2026-06-23.md`) found the
//! chasm: `dregg-app-framework` is real + load-bearing and the 20 starbridge-apps
//! are fully built + tested — but `starbridge-v2` did not even depend on them.
//! There was no `AppRegistry`, no launcher, no way to open a *pre-built* app. The
//! powerbox (`crate::powerbox`) can birth a *bare* confined cell; it cannot open a
//! gallery/tussle/auction.
//!
//! This module closes that gap by INTEGRATION (the framework + apps already exist):
//! an [`AppRegistry`] lists each wired app — its id, name, what-it-does, and the
//! real `*_app(cipherclerk, executor) -> DeosApp` ctor — and [`AppRegistry::launch`]
//! instantiates an entry against a **live app-substrate** ([`AppSubstrate`]: an
//! [`AppCipherclerk`] + [`EmbeddedExecutor`] from the app framework), seeds the
//! app's backing cell so its program bites, and returns a [`LaunchedRegistryApp`]
//! whose affordances fire **REAL verified turns** on that substrate's ledger.
//!
//! ## What "the live World" means here (honest)
//!
//! The cockpit's [`crate::world::World`] wraps `dregg_sdk::embed::DreggEngine`,
//! which owns its `dregg_cell::Ledger` BY VALUE. The app framework's
//! [`EmbeddedExecutor`] wraps an `AgentRuntime` whose ledger is an
//! `Arc<Mutex<Ledger>>`. They are DISTINCT physical ledgers — folding an app's
//! cells into `World`'s engine ledger would need a `World`/`DreggEngine` refactor
//! out of this lane's scope. So a launched app runs on its OWN app-substrate
//! ledger (the app framework's), NOT `World`'s engine ledger.
//!
//! What IS genuinely shared — and what the verify test proves — is the substrate
//! ledger BETWEEN the fire and the inspector: a launched app's affordance fire
//! WRITES to the substrate's executor ledger, and a second reader of that SAME
//! executor ([`AppSubstrate::cell_state`]) sees the new cell state. That is a real
//! shared ledger (writer = the verified turn; reader = the inspector seam), just
//! the app-framework's ledger rather than `World`'s. The registry is the cockpit's
//! own holder of these app substrates, so the cockpit's app-inspector reads them.
//!
//! gpui-free and `cargo test`-able (gated on `app-registry`, pulled by
//! `embedded-executor`): the launch + the real verified turn run with no GPU.
