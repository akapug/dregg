//! The shell — a cap-first window manager + compositor over real cells.
//!
//! This is the native desktop-OS pillar of the master interface. The [`Shell`]
//! owns a set of [`Surface`]s, the z-order stack, the focus, and the
//! **firmament surface-fabric** the window caps are checked against. It is a
//! CAP-FIRST window manager: every window op — focus, raise, move, resize,
//! minimize, close, share — is GATED by the surface's capability. There is no
//! ambient authority over a window; you drive a surface only by presenting the
//! cap the shell minted when it opened.
//!
//! **The authority is the REAL `dregg_firmament` capability** (`docs/
//! DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md` §7 — the one latent divergence, closed). The shell owns
//! a [`SurfaceBacking`](dregg_firmament::SurfaceBacking): a real
//! [`dregg_cell::Ledger`] + [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor`]. When a surface opens,
//! the shell seeds a fresh *backing surface-cell* + an *owner holder* in that
//! fabric and installs the owner's original grant over the backing cell; the
//! returned [`SurfaceCapability`] carries the REAL
//! [`Capability`](dregg_firmament::Capability) `target = Surface(backing_cell)`.
//! Every op authenticates by RESOLVING that cap through the firmament's
//! `granted ⊆ held` ([`is_attenuation`](dregg_firmament::is_attenuation)) gate —
//! the SAME gate the local (`seL4_CNode_Mint`) and distributed (`recKDelegate
//! Atten`) backings use, no special-casing. A window-SHARE
//! ([`Shell::share`]) runs a GENUINE `Effect::GrantCapability` turn, so a
//! WIDENING share is REJECTED by the real executor — the no-amplification
//! guarantee firing at the desktop. There is NO bearer-secret model.
//!
//! Each surface is a view of a REAL cell in the embedded [`World`](crate::world)
//! (apps-as-cells). The shell reads the live world ledger to:
//!   * derive each surface's TRUSTED-PATH identity label (the owning cell's real
//!     id + lifecycle) — anti-spoof chrome the shell draws, not the surface, so
//!     a surface cannot impersonate another cell, and
//!   * compose a [`Scene`]: the ordered, gpui-free description of what to paint
//!     (back-to-front), which the cockpit maps onto a gpui scene.
//!
//! Two ledgers, two distinct roles: the firmament fabric holds the AUTHORITY
//! cap-graph (what the cap gate checks); the embedded world holds the rendered
//! CONTENT + identity (what `compose` reads). The viewed cell (identity) and the
//! backing surface-cell (authority) are kept distinct — exactly as a surface and
//! its cap are distinct objects.
//!
//! The compositor framing: the cockpit is ONE privileged [`SurfaceKind::Console`]
//! surface; the other surfaces are cap-confined cell views, tiled/floated/
//! stacked in z-order. Surfaces show real cell state and react to real turns
//! (re-read each frame).
//!
//! This module is gpui-free and `cargo test`-able. The cockpit owns the gpui
//! mapping + the input routing.
