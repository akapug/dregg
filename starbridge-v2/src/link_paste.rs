//! `dregg://` LINK-PASTE — Xanadu links, made usable (hyperdreggmedia authoring
//! surface #5, `docs/deos/HYPERDREGGMEDIA-NOTES.md §6`).
//!
//! The other Nelson surfaces in this crate ([`crate::web_cells`],
//! [`crate::cell_transclusion`], [`crate::links_here`]) BUILD the docuverse — the
//! addressing, the verified per-viewer transclusion, the two-way witness-graph. This
//! one makes the *authoring gesture* usable: **select a cell → copy a `dregg://` URI →
//! PASTE a live provenanced transclusion into a document.** On the open web a paste is
//! a dead copy (or a brittle `<iframe src=…>` that trusts whatever bytes the host
//! returns); here a paste is a REAL verified embed — receipt-pinned, per-viewer,
//! darkening for an unauthorized reader, and *unforgeable* (a bad/forged URI resolves
//! to NOTHING, never a faked inclusion).
//!
//! ## Everything here is the REAL machinery, never a parallel model
//!
//! - The URI is the genuine [`web_aff::DreggUri`] scheme `web_cells` already speaks:
//!   [`uri_for`] is `DreggUri::new(cell).to_uri_string()` (the content-addressed
//!   `dregg://<hex>` cell id — the address IS the access grant and the identity), and
//!   [`parse_uri`] round-trips it back to a [`CellRef`]. A copy then a paste of the
//!   SAME cell is the same `dregg://` page the browser lists.
//! - The PASTE is a real [`WholeCellTransclusion::embed`] ([`crate::cell_transclusion`])
//!   — the verified `dregg://` finalized read of the source cell's surface root
//!   (content → commitment → receipt → receipt-stream root → quorum). A forged or
//!   absent or non-finalized URI fails HERE: no opened provenance ⇒ NO embed (the
//!   anti-forge tooth, inherited verbatim from [`TranscludedField::include`]).
//! - The per-viewer DARKENING is the real [`WholeCellTransclusion::project_for`]
//!   through the genuine [`web_aff::Membrane`]: an authorized reader gets the embed at
//!   their cap level (content + affordances + the cited receipt); an under-capped /
//!   incomparable reader gets a DARKENED paste — the citation (provenance) survives,
//!   the content is withheld (never forged, never substituted).
//!
//! ## What this IS and is NOT
//!
//! It is a gpui-free, `cargo test`-able **logic core** (like `web_cells.rs` /
//! `cell_transclusion.rs`): a [`LinkPasteDoc`] accumulates [`Paste`]s, each a real
//! [`WholeCellTransclusion`] resolved per-viewer to a [`ResolveStatus`]
//! (Resolved / Darkened / Unresolvable + the cited receipt). The cockpit renders these
//! rows; because they are built here gpui-free, a `cargo test` proves a paste is a real
//! verified embed without a GPU.
//!
//! It is NOT a new circuit constraint or a new attestation: the soundness is the
//! EXISTING `WholeCellTransclusion` provenance + `Membrane` non-amp. It reinvents
//! nothing — it composes the proven embed with the proven URI scheme into the one
//! gesture authoring needs.
