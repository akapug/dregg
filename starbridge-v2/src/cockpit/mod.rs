//! The gpui cockpit — the comprehensive visual master interface.
//!
//! This is the visual layer (gpui-gated, `native-full` only). It renders the
//! embedded [`World`](crate::world::World) — the live local dregg image — across
//! the four dregg-surpasses-Smalltalk axes, each a panel:
//!
//!   * CELL WORLD (left rail) — every cell as a live object; click to inspect.
//!     The ocap axis: the cap count + the graph edges are first-class.
//!   * INSPECTOR (center) — the selected object reflected through the uniform
//!     [`reflect`](crate::reflect) model: cell ⟷ receipt ⟷ image, navigable.
//!   * BLOCKLACE (center-low) — the provenance axis: the receipt chain as a
//!     navigable causal history (time-travel).
//!   * COMPOSER (right) — direct-manipulation turn composition: pick a verb,
//!     watch the EMBEDDED EXECUTOR run it and the image + receipts update live.
//!   * DYNAMICS (right-low) — the live activity feed off the dynamics stream.
//!   * IMAGE/FEDERATION (rail header) — the distribution axis: this image's
//!     state-root commitment, presented as one sovereign image among a
//!     federation.
//!
//! gpui is single-threaded; the `World` is shared as `Rc<RefCell<World>>`. Every
//! verb button mutates it through `World::commit_turn` (the REAL executor) and
//! the views re-render from the post-state on the next frame.

// ===========================================================================
// THE COCKPIT, SPLIT INTO FOCUSED SUBMODULES.
//
// `Cockpit` (the model struct + the shared types above) lives here; its behaviour
// is a single logical `impl Cockpit` carved across the modules below (Rust lets
// one type's inherent impl span many files of the same crate). Each submodule
// pulls the shared imports + types through `use super::*;`. The free render
// helpers live in `helpers` and are re-exported here so every panel module sees
// them. Nothing here changes behaviour — it is purely the old god-module
// re-shelved by responsibility.
