//! THE FRACTAL META-DEBUG (M5) — suspend the live system, inspect it as an
//! object, recursively (debug the debugger).
//!
//! `docs/deos/FIRMAMENT-REFLEXIVE-SUBSTRATE.md` §2-§3 and
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/deos/REFLEXIVE-MIGRATION.md` §4 name the keystone: make a meta-level
//! *itself a [`FocusTarget`]*, so "debug the debugger" is literally focusing the
//! inspector on its own [`MetaDebugView`] — recursion through the SAME
//! [`Registry::present`](crate::presentable::Registry::present) dispatch, no new
//! mechanism. Three pieces, all reusing the existing spine:
//!
//!   * **Suspend = halt-the-live-loop** — distinct from Snapshot (which freezes a
//!     *cursor* while the loop runs). The gate + the pending queue live on
//!     [`World`](crate::world::World) ([`World::suspend`], [`World::resume`]); this
//!     module's [`MetaDebugView`] is the INSPECTABLE object over the
//!     frozen-but-live head.
//!   * **The one-arm reflexivity** — [`MetaDebugView`] `impl`s
//!     [`Presentable`](crate::presentable::Presentable), dispatched through the new
//!     [`FocusTarget::DebugFrame`](crate::presentable::FocusTarget::DebugFrame) /
//!     `::World` / `::Cockpit` arms. Focusing the inspector on a `DebugFrame`
//!     presents that meta-level's own view — the 3-Lisp tower, grounded at the gpui
//!     loop.
//!   * **The [`MetaStack`]** — the lazily-materialized tower (`push` to climb,
//!     `pop` to descend). A `MetaLevel` is paid for only when the operator presses
//!     "suspend & inspect". The recursion terminates because the floor (the native
//!     gpui loop) is not a `World` and holds no cap.
//!
//! ## The self-cycle is a unit-delay (STRATIFIED-FIXPOINT §7.3)
//!
//! A `MetaDebugView` reads the SUSPENDED head's WITNESSED state (the frozen
//! cursor's height + the live ledger paused at it), never a within-frame fixpoint
//! of "present including self". `present` stays PURE: it observes the suspended
//! world, it never mutates it and never confers authority. A meta-frame ON a
//! meta-frame reads the lower frame's committed view — the prior-frame read that
//! breaks the cycle (the firmament supplies the strata; the self-cycle is the
//! unit-delay).
//!
//! gpui-FREE and `cargo test`-able exactly as [`crate::presentable`] /
//! [`crate::ui_snapshot`] / [`crate::view_cell`] are.
