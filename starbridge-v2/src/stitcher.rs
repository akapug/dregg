//! THE STITCHER — hyperdreggmedia authoring surface #3 (`docs/deos/HYPERDREGGMEDIA-NOTES.md`
//! §6.3): a merge **conflict** rendered as **two live alternatives**, made *touchable* —
//! a user PICKs one, ORDERs both, or writes a CUSTOM resolution, and the antichain
//! collapses into a real, receipted turn (a [`dregg_doc::Patch`]), the loser
//! *dropped-but-provenanced*, never silently lost.
//!
//! ## Where it sits
//!
//! The patch core already does the math: [`dregg_doc::merge`] is the pushout (a
//! conflict is a first-class [`dregg_doc::ConflictRegion`] antichain, never a
//! failure), and [`dregg_doc::resolutions_for`] enumerates the ready resolution
//! *patches* per region. The [`crate::doc_editor`] lane drives a single document's
//! editing turns. What was missing is the **authoring surface for the conflict
//! itself** — the moment two authors diverged, surfaced as a touchable object that
//! carries BOTH readings with their provenance and lets a reader settle it.
//!
//! `Stitcher` is that surface, gpui-free and `cargo test`-able like `web_cells` /
//! `doc_editor`: it is *data + turns*, so the renderer (cockpit / browser / seL4) is
//! free to paint the two alternatives however it likes — the logic here decides
//! WHAT the conflict is, WHO wrote each side, and applies the chosen resolution as a
//! patch committed to the document's [`dregg_doc::History`] (on the substrate, a
//! cap-gated verified turn leaving a receipt; here, a content-addressed
//! [`dregg_doc::PatchId`] = the receipt id).
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! - [`Stitcher::from_branches`] — build a stitcher from two authors' divergent
//!   document branches (the membrane shape: each drove a `Doc`/`History` off a
//!   shared prefix). The two branches are stitched (pushout) into one conflicted
//!   history; the unresolved conflict regions are surfaced.
//! - [`Stitcher::conflicts`] — list the [`ConflictView`]s: each conflict region
//!   with BOTH (all) alternatives, each carrying its rendered text + provenance
//!   (who wrote it). The "two live alternatives" the surface paints.
//! - [`Stitcher::choices`] — for a region, the ready [`StitchChoice`]s a reader can
//!   click: pick-A, pick-B, order-both, or a custom resolution patch — each a
//!   ready, attributed [`dregg_doc::Patch`].
//! - [`Stitcher::resolve`] — apply a chosen resolution. The patch is committed to
//!   the history (a real turn), the antichain collapses keeping the chosen content,
//!   the dropped branch is tombstoned (retained for provenance — its atoms stay in
//!   the graph as `Dead`, so "what was rejected and by whom" is still a fact). The
//!   committed [`dregg_doc::PatchId`] is the resolution's receipt.
//! - [`Stitcher::custom_resolution`] — a reader who wants neither side verbatim
//!   types a replacement text; the stitcher diffs it into the resolving patch (the
//!   conflict collapses to the typed reading), still a receipted turn.
//!
//! Every gesture is a patch; every patch is a turn; every turn is a receipt — the
//! one unifying truth of the authoring layer (§6). The stitcher never decides for
//! the reader (no last-writer-wins, no silent merge): it *presents* the divergence
//! and *records* the human choice.
