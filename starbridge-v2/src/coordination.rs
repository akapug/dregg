//! THE COORDINATION GRAPH — the causal shape of the swarm (N17).
//!
//! A small directed view of how a swarm's members coordinate, built purely from
//! the live [`Swarm`] + [`World`] (gpui-free, `cargo test`-able). Two relations,
//! drawn as two layers (`.docs-history-noclaude/ADOS-DEEPENING.md` §3.4, `docs/design-frontiers/AGENT-SWARM-UX.md`
//! §4.3):
//!
//!   * **NODES** are the swarm's members (one per member, in boot order).
//!   * **NOTIFY ARROWS** ([`NotifyArrow`]) are the deposited [`NotifyEdge`]s — the
//!     async wakes one member's committed `EmitEvent` turn deposited in another's
//!     inbox. A→B means "A woke B" (the sender → the inbox holder). These are the
//!     CAUSALITY of the swarm: the arrow lands on emit and fades on drain. They do
//!     NOT imply synchronization — the two receipts (sender's emit, recipient's
//!     drain) are independent (the ocap async-message model).
//!   * **MANDATE EDGES** ([`MandateArrow`]) are the FAINTER background reach graph:
//!     a directed edge `holder ──▶ target` for every capability a member holds
//!     reaching ANOTHER member (the real c-list, restricted to the swarm). This is
//!     "who CAN reach whom" — the structural authority the executor will enforce,
//!     drawn behind the live notify arrows.
//!
//! The whole point (the deepest legibility win over a log scroll): a flat feed
//! cannot show a DAG, and agent coordination *is* a DAG. The pale-ghost question
//! for the graph: *can the operator be fooled about who woke whom, or about who
//! CAN reach whom?* No — every notify arrow is a real deposited edge from a
//! committed turn, and every mandate edge is a real `CapabilityRef` read from the
//! live ledger (never a parallel model).
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! [`SwarmGraph::build`] computes a DETERMINISTIC layout: members are placed on a
//! circle in boot order (the canonical swarm ordering), so the same swarm always
//! lays out identically (no force simulation, no RNG — a test can assert exact
//! positions). The cockpit renders the nodes at these positions and draws the two
//! arrow layers between them.
//!
//! # The single-image boundary
//!
//! This graph shows the members of THIS image's swarm (n=1). A cross-image swarm
//! (members on different federated nodes) is the federation-connect lane (the same
//! model over the peer view) — named, not faked.
