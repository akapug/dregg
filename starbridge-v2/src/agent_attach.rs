//! AGENT ATTACH — bind the confined agent's `run_js` (deos-js) to the cockpit's
//! LIVE World, so a Claude in Hermes drives the OPERATOR'S ACTUAL CELLS.
//!
//! `deos-js`'s [`Applet`](deos_js::Applet) mints its own private engine; the agent's
//! JS only ever touches that throwaway world. THE ATTACH PATH (`deos_js::attach`)
//! binds the runtime to a PROVIDED [`World`] instead — the cockpit's running image
//! (the headline: "The Cool Place"), or a [`World::fork`] of it (the safe sandbox).
//!
//! This module is the cockpit-side weld: [`WorldSinkAdapter`] implements
//! `deos_js::WorldSink` over the cockpit's `Rc<RefCell<World>>`, so the JS:
//!
//!   * `deos.world.cells()` / `deos.cell(id).reflect()` crawl the LIVE ledger's real
//!     cells (a witnessed read through the shared World borrow); and
//!   * `app.fire("name", n)` commits a real verified turn THROUGH `World::commit_turn`
//!     — a receipt that lands on the cockpit's own provenance log + dynamics feed.
//!
//! ## The red-team invariant is KEPT (`docs/deos/AGENT-CONFINEMENT-REDTEAM.md`)
//!
//! The cap tooth runs in deos-js BEFORE the turn reaches `commit_turn`: the
//! [`AttachedApplet`](deos_js::AttachedApplet) is mounted under the agent's `held`
//! authority, never the World's root, and an over-reach (a `required` the agent does
//! not hold) is refused in-band — no turn, no receipt, `commit_turn` never called. A
//! fire binds the agent's OWN cell, so it cannot cross to another vessel. The World's
//! own executor is the SECOND gate (it re-checks conservation / ocap / authority on
//! every committed turn), so even a bug in the deos-js tooth cannot forge a turn the
//! live executor would reject.
