//! THE UI-CELL SUBSTRATE (M3) — the cockpit's own view-state, self-hosted as
//! real dregg cells, by generalizing the proven [`BufferCell`](crate::buffer)
//! two-tier split.
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/deos/REFLEXIVE-MIGRATION.md` §3 names the keystone: promote the
//! cockpit's ~50 plain-Rust *camera-aim* fields (focus, tab, present-index,
//! selection, …) into dregg **cells**, so the inspector becomes inspectable, the
//! UI becomes a witnessed graph, and the tools become objects in the image (the
//! Smalltalk knot). This module is the substrate move:
//!
//!   * [`ViewCell`] — one **UI cell** for an inspector view's `(focus,
//!     present_idx)` camera-aim. It is the [`BufferCell`] pattern verbatim, only
//!     the payload is the view's semantic state rather than a text digest: a
//!     **free in-memory draft** ([`ViewDoc`], mutated on every re-focus with no
//!     ledger cost) plus an **occasional witnessed commit** ([`ViewCell::commit`],
//!     a real cap-gated `Effect::SetField` turn). Its **revision = the backing
//!     cell's nonce** — the receipt chain IS the view's navigation history.
//!   * [`ViewCell`] is itself [`Presentable`] (registered through
//!     [`FocusTarget::ViewCell`](crate::presentable::FocusTarget)) — so you can
//!     **inspect the inspector**: open the moldable inspector ON a `ViewCell` and
//!     see its `(focus, present_idx, revision)` as a real presentation set.
//!   * [`WorkspaceCell`] — the wider semantic-UI-state subgraph (active tab +
//!     per-tab view aim), the same two-tier split over a backing cell, so the
//!     cockpit's `render()` reads its tab/focus selector FROM a cell
//!     (`render(workspace_subgraph)`, §3.4) rather than from a Rust field.
//!
//! ## The UI-mutation weight class (§3.5) and the self-cycle (STRATIFIED-FIXPOINT)
//!
//! A tab-switch / re-focus **conserves nothing** — it is the `SetField` weight
//! class, exactly as a buffer keystroke is. Free re-focus stays in the in-memory
//! draft; a witnessed **commit** (what makes the image durable/rewindable) lands a
//! `SetField` turn only occasionally. And the reflexive self-cycle (a `ViewCell`
//! that the inspector projects is itself view-state) is broken by **unit-delay**:
//! `present` reads the *committed* (prior-frame) cell state, never a within-frame
//! fixpoint — `present` stays PURE and observes authority, it never confers it
//! (the load-bearing M3 invariant).
//!
//! gpui-FREE and `cargo test`-able exactly as [`crate::buffer`] /
//! [`crate::presentable`] are; the cockpit maps a [`ViewCell`] onto its existing
//! moldable-inspector pane (only the *selector* moves from a Rust field to a cell
//! read).
