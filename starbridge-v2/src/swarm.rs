//! THE SWARM COORDINATOR — multi-agent activity surface (A2, the ADOS keystone).
//!
//! **ADOS north-star:** an agent is an intricate LOOP; dregg grounds the ONE
//! seam that matters — **the agent's ACTIONS, at the tool-call/turn boundary**.
//! A2 extends A1 (single agent-activity surface) to N agents coordinating in a
//! swarm: each member is a cap-confined `Surface` cell; their actions are
//! cap-gated, receipted turns; and their COORDINATION is routed through the
//! **notify edge** — an `EmitEvent` turn committed by one member that deposits
//! a pending wake in the recipient's inbox, to be DRAINED by the recipient in
//! its OWN SEPARATE FUTURE TURN (async, not synchronous, not a joint turn).
//!
//! # The notify-edge model
//!
//! ```text
//!   member A  ──(EmitEvent turn · receipt rA)──▶  notify inbox of B
//!                                                         │
//!                                                  [pending wake]
//!                                                         │
//!   member B  ◀──(drain turn · receipt rB)─────────────────
//! ```
//!
//! The two receipts (`rA`, `rB`) are INDEPENDENT on-ledger records — they share
//! no parent, no synchrony, no joint authorization. The wake is observable (the
//! `NotifyEdge` appears in the inbox) but the drain is entirely B's next turn:
//! B decides when to drain, how, and with what effects. This is the ocap async-
//! message model applied to a swarm: the coordinator sees the causality (A→B)
//! without forcing any synchronization (the "pale-ghost" question for agents:
//! *can an operator be fooled about what two agents coordinated?* No — the
//! `EventEmitted` in the dynamics and the drain receipt are the on-ledger truth).
//!
//! # Two coordination shapes (async edge + atomic bundle) and the SURFACE
//!
//! The swarm offers TWO coordination primitives, plus a cap-confined pane per
//! member:
//!
//!   * **The async notify edge** ([`Swarm::run`] → [`Swarm::drain_notify`]) —
//!     causal-but-independent, above (A wakes B; B drains in its OWN future turn).
//!   * **The atomic swarm turn** ([`Swarm::run_atomic`]) — N member-actions
//!     bundled into ONE forest turn the executor commits ALL-OR-NOTHING (a
//!     coordinator atomically settling a multi-party exchange or fanning a batch
//!     out in one verified step; bounded by the coordinator's mandate, ONE
//!     receipt for the whole bundle). Where the notify edge deliberately does NOT
//!     synchronize, the atomic turn deliberately DOES — both are real, and they
//!     compose (a bundled `EmitEvent` still deposits a notify edge).
//!   * **The per-member SURFACE** ([`Swarm::bind_surface`]) — each member bound
//!     to a cap-confined shell surface (its pane), owned via a REAL
//!     `dregg_firmament` [`SurfaceCapability`](crate::surface::SurfaceCapability)
//!     the shell gates every window op on. So the swarm's panes carry the SAME
//!     no-ambient-authority discipline at the glass as its turns do on the
//!     ledger (`.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md`: each agent pane is a confined Surface
//!     the shell composites).
//!
//! # What is runnable
//!
//! This module is gpui-FREE and `cargo test`-able. The cockpit maps
//! [`SwarmView`] onto a new `SWARM` tab, backed by real turns through the
//! embedded [`World`](crate::world::World). The demo path:
//!   1. `Swarm::new(world, members)` — seed N agent cells with mandates.
//!   2. `Swarm::run_member(world, agent, cmd)` — a member commits an
//!      in-mandate command (cap-gated turn); if it includes an `EmitEvent`
//!      targeting another member, a `NotifyEdge` lands in that member's inbox.
//!   3. `Swarm::drain_notify(world, agent)` — the target member commits a drain
//!      (its own separate ack turn); the inbox entry is consumed.
//!   4. `SwarmView::build(swarm, world)` — the gpui-free render model for the
//!      SWARM tab (each member's mandate + action count + inbox drain state).
//!
//! # SDK binding
//!
//! The `NotifyEdge` + `SwarmInbox` model binds to the real dregg SDK at:
//!   - `dregg_turn::action::Effect::EmitEvent` — the sender's receipted turn
//!     (already in the executor; no new protocol verbs needed).
//!   - `dregg_cell::Cell::capabilities` — the mandate (`SwarmMember::mandate`
//!     reads from the live cell's c-list, same as `AgentActivity`).
//!   - `dregg_sdk::embed::DreggEngine::execute_turn` — the swarm's turns route
//!     through the same verified executor, no special path.
//!     The inbox is LOCAL STATE here (starbridge-v2 tracks it from the dynamics
//!     stream); in a distributed setting it would be the recipient cell's own state
//!     field (a pending-event queue in the cell's storage), with the dregg-node
//!     routing `EmitEvent` as a network message and the cell's program draining it.
