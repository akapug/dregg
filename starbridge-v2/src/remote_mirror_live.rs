//! THE LIVE FACE of the remote mirror — following a remote dregg image's DYNAMICS
//! stream across distance, gated by the mirror-cap's reflective depth.
//!
//! [`remote_mirror`](crate::remote_mirror) gives the mirror its STATIC read face:
//! [`RemoteMirror::reflect`](crate::remote_mirror::RemoteMirror::reflect) resolves
//! a one-shot snapshot of a remote cell at the cap's depth. But the `Live` depth
//! promises more than a snapshot — it promises to *follow the live dynamics stream
//! as the remote image evolves* ([`MirrorDepth::reveals_dynamics`]). That promise
//! is what this module makes concrete: a [`LiveMirror`] welds the existing live
//! dynamics organ ([`ReceiptFeed`] — the SSE receipt stream the local inspector
//! already consumes) to a [`MirrorCap`], surfacing the remote cell's evolution as
//! it commits — and ONLY when the cap's depth is `Live`.
//!
//! ## The depth axis, made concrete on the live stream (the second polarity)
//!
//! A mirror's reflective depth is a real attenuation coordinate
//! (`Structure ⊑ ReadState ⊑ Live`). The static face already enforces it (a
//! `Structure` mirror redacts state). The live face enforces the TOP of the
//! lattice: only a `Live`-depth mirror may *follow the dynamics tail*. A
//! `ReadState` mirror reads the remote cell's current state but is REFUSED the
//! live stream ([`LiveRefusal::DepthTooShallow`]) — the `widens_to` tooth on the
//! reflection axis, now biting on the evolution face, not just the snapshot. This
//! is the mirror's no-amplification rule reaching the most-trusted depth: *seeing
//! the remote's state confers no edge to watch it change.*
//!
//! ## It REUSES the dynamics organ — no parallel stream
//!
//! The live tail is the genuine [`ReceiptFeed`] the local inspector's receipt
//! pane already drives off `GET /api/events/stream`. The mirror does not invent a
//! second stream model: it holds a `&ReceiptFeed` fed by the SAME transport that
//! backs [`RemoteImage`](crate::remote_mirror::RemoteImage), and PROJECTS the tail
//! down to exactly the receipts that NAME the mirror's cell (a remote turn that
//! never touched this cell is not this mirror's to see). The projection rides
//! [`ReceiptEvent::cells`] — the cells a committed turn named — so the live face is
//! the same per-cell delta the local `dynamics`/memo fold already keys on.
//!
//! ## Read-only by construction (no write edge from the live face)
//!
//! A `LiveMirror` exposes ONLY observation — the evolving tail. It carries no
//! edit verb; the write face stays the static mirror's gated
//! [`RemoteMirror::propose_edit`](crate::remote_mirror::RemoteMirror::propose_edit),
//! which a read-only cap refuses (`viewSurface_confers_no_edge`). Watching a remote
//! image evolve confers no edge to drive its evolution. This is the firmament
//! property [`viewSurface_confers_no_edge`] taken to the live axis: a mirror that
//! *watches* still cannot *write*.
//!
//! ## Distance is honest here too
//!
//! Every live reflection carries the firmament [`Bounds`] for the transport's
//! distance. At `n = 1` the stream is strong-local (immediate); at `n > 1` it is
//! the eventual netlayer tail (at-least-once across reconnects, the `ReceiptFeed`'s
//! own dedup-by-`chain_index` discipline). The verbs are unchanged across `n`;
//! only the bounds relax — the firmament's `n`-collapse, on the live face.
//!
//! gpui-free; `cargo test`-able under `embedded-executor` (reuses `live_node`'s
//! `ReceiptFeed` + `remote_mirror`'s `MirrorCap`/`Bounds`, no network).
