//! each journal entry and its head cross the same redb transaction as the data
//! they publish. Recording trusted setup does not establish kernel authority or
//! conservation for that setup operation.
//!
//! Recovery checks every journal pre/post root and then World re-executes the
//! exact interleaving, checking actual turn receipts and complete checkpoint
//! bytes. World checkpoints name an ordered step, because a turn height alone
//! cannot distinguish setup changes. The full history remains available.
//!
//! Nonempty legacy images without event ordering are preserved and refused for
//! explicit migration. Only an unpublished commit-log suffix may be removed,

//! These are executable checks; no Lean refinement theorem for this new physical
//! World journal is claimed by sharing the node's store primitives.
