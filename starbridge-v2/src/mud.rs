//! **DREGG-MUD — the first slice.** A decentralized multi-user world where a
//! *room is a cell, an inhabitant is a cap-rooted session, and an item is a
//! capability*. See `docs/deos/DREGG-MUD.md` for the full vision.
//!
//! This module is the typed, `cargo test`-able first slice. It reinvents NO
//! authority machinery — `Room`, `Inhabitant`, and `Item` are thin designations
//! over the REAL [`crate::world::World`] (the embedded verified executor), the
//! REAL [`dregg_cell::CapabilitySet`] (the c-list), and the REAL
//! [`crate::powerbox::Powerbox`] grant path (the two attenuation gates +
//! executor backstop). It lives in the periphery (not in the churning
//! `circuit`/`turn`/`cockpit`) and WELDS the existing primitives into the MUD
//! object model.
//!
//! ## The mappings (every MUD noun → a dregg primitive)
//!
//! * **room = a cell** — a [`Room`] is a [`CellId`]; its c-list holds caps to its
//!   exits (neighbour rooms) and the items lying in it.
//! * **inhabitant = a cap-rooted session** — an [`Inhabitant`] is a [`CellId`]
//!   (the identity cell, `session.rs`); what it can reach IS its authority.
//! * **item = a capability** — an [`Item`] is a [`CellId`] for the item-cell;
//!   *holding the item* is *holding a cap to it* in your c-list.
//! * **exit = a cap edge** — a room "connects to" a neighbour iff its c-list
//!   `has_access(&neighbour)`.
//! * **locked door = an absent cap** — you cannot form an entering turn without a
//!   cap whose [`AuthRequired`] you satisfy ([`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`]).
//! * **pick up / give = `Effect::GrantCapability` + `RevokeCapability`** — the
//!   item cap MOVES; the source loses it. Conservation of the capability itself.
//! * **act = a verified turn** — every mutation is a [`Turn`] the executor admits
//!   only if `required ⊆ held`, leaving a verifiable [`TurnReceipt`].
//!
//! ## The load-bearing scenario (the test below proves it)
//!
//! > Two players in one room; one picks up the item; the other CANNOT dupe it.
//!
//! The pickup is a real grant of the item cap into the picker's c-list paired
//! with a real revoke from the room — so after the pickup the ROOM no longer
//! holds the cap. A second player's pickup attempt is then refused by the
//! powerbox's own `mint_needs_held_factory` gate (you cannot grant what the
//! source does not hold) — *duping is structurally inexpressible, not policed.*

// =============================================================================
// PHASE 2 — PRESENCE (a conserved cap artifact) + SAY (over the captp data plane)
// =============================================================================
//
// This is the seam DEOS-RUNS.md names: *"presence is the door-cap-gated write
// (entry cap-gating proven; a fuller presence-token move/grant is future)"* —
// here the fuller move lands. Presence is NOT a Rust set:
//
//   * **presence = a conserved token** — a [`PresenceToken`] is a cell; *being in
//     a room* is *the room's c-list holding the cap to your token*. Entering
//     MOVES the token into the room ([`move_cap`] — the same grant+revoke pair as
//     [`pick_up`], gated by `mint_needs_held_factory`), leaving moves it back out.
//     Single custody of the cap ⇒ an inhabitant is never present in two rooms —
//     conservation, not bookkeeping.
//   * **"who is here" = a read of the room cell** — [`Room::hosts`] /
//     [`Room::who_is_here`] read the live ledger's c-list, nothing else.
//   * **entry is still the door tooth** — [`enter`] runs [`move_through`] FIRST:
//     the executor refuses (`CapabilityNotHeld`) unless the mover holds the door
//     cap, before the token moves. The phase-1 gate keeps passing.
//   * **say = a cap-gated enqueue on the Bus** — a room's chat rides the REAL
//     [`dregg_captp::data_plane::Bus`]: the speaker presents a [`SendCap`] into
//     the room's channel and [`Bus::enqueue`] admits or refuses at
//     [`SendCap::admits`] — a speaker who is not present presents a cap that
//     DERIVES revoked and is refused BY THE CAP GATE
//     ([`DataPlaneError::Unauthorized`]), never by an if-statement here. Hearers
//     are the present inhabitants' inboxes (topic fan-out), drained in FIFO
//     order, each delivery a signed, verifying custody receipt.
//   * **the speak cap is DERIVED from the on-ledger presence token** — issuance
//     is NOT a host table: [`RoomVoice::speak_cap_for`] projects the room's
//     channel authority through the presence fact ([`Room::hosts`], a pure c-list
//     read), minting a LIVE cap iff the room currently holds the inhabitant's
//     token cap and a REVOKED one otherwise. Holding presence ⟹ the speak cap is
//     derivable; losing it (the token cap moves out on [`leave`]) ⟹ the SAME
//     derivation yields a dead cap — silence from the ledger, not from a table.
//
// The room's own inbox doubles as its chat log — the same "room = a cell whose
// history is its messages" shape as `deos_matrix::cell::RoomCell`, without any
// deos-matrix dependency (the Bus inbox IS the history here).
//
// WELD CLOSED (issuance is now a property of the ledger): the speak cap is no
// longer minted/revoked by a host table on enter/leave. [`RoomVoice::speak_cap_for`]
// DERIVES it fresh from the on-ledger presence token every `say` — the room
// hosting your token cap (a receipted [`move_cap`] put it there) is the SOLE
// source of speak authority, and its ABSENCE (the token cap moved back out) is
// the SOLE source of silence. [`RoomVoice::admit`]/[`expel`] now weld only the
// HEARING side (topic subscribe/unsubscribe); speaking rides the derivation.
// Because the verdict is a function of the ledger, ANY box holding a copy of the
// ledger derives the identical cap — which is exactly what a 3-box net needs.
//
// REMAINING SEAM (multi-node): `speak_cap_for` reads the EMBEDDED [`World`]
// ledger; the NodeWorldSink integration will point that read at the node-backed
// ledger view (`with_ledger`), and the hearing subscription (still Bus-side, per
// process) must likewise be derived from ledger presence on each box.
