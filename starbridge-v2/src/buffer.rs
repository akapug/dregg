//! THE EDITOR / BUFFER SURFACE — a text buffer as a cap-confined Surface cell.
//!
//! The first DEVELOPER content surface of the dregg IDE (A1, the rung after the
//! A0 compositor + agent-activity surface). An editor buffer is exactly the
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md` §1 story applied to *text you author*: a window is
//! a `Capability{ Surface(cell) }`, and a buffer is a cap-confined VIEW of a
//! cell whose state IS the buffer — so *who may edit it* is an ocap question the
//! verified executor answers, not an ambient one.
//!
//! **The buffer is backed by a REAL cell.** Its content lives in a gpui-free
//! in-memory document (the visible text), but the AUTHORITY + PROVENANCE of an
//! edit are grounded in the embedded verified [`World`](crate::world): the
//! backing cell carries the buffer's **content digest** (a state field) + a
//! monotonic **revision** (the cell's nonce, advanced by each edit). Committing
//! an edit is a CAP-GATED TURN — a real `Effect::SetField` writing the new
//! digest into the backing cell through [`World::commit_turn`] (the same
//! `TurnExecutor` every other dregg effect runs). So an edit lands iff the
//! editor holds the write authority, and every landed edit appends a real
//! receipt to the world's provenance log. The text is the surface's *content*;
//! the digest-in-the-cell is the authenticated bind a light client can check
//! (the §5 `sourceStateRoot` story, for a buffer).
//!
//! **A read-only buffer is an ATTENUATED cap.** Mirroring the A0 §7 surface
//! discipline (`crate::surface` — a window is owned via the real firmament
//! [`Capability`](dregg_firmament::Capability), ops gated on
//! [`is_attenuation`](dregg_firmament::is_attenuation)), a writable buffer holds
//! a full-rights surface cap and a read-only mirror holds a *narrowed*
//! (`AuthRequired::Signature`) one — obtained only by genuine attenuation, never
//! by self-promotion. A write to a read-only buffer is REFUSED by the SAME
//! `granted ⊆ held` gate the compositor + the firmament use, BEFORE any turn is
//! attempted: the no-amplification rule firing at the editor.
//!
//! Two gates compose, exactly as in [`crate::shell::Shell::present`]:
//!   1. THE BUFFER-CAP GATE — the edit must present a cap that authorizes a
//!      WRITE (a read-only mirror has nothing to present → refused).
//!   2. THE EXECUTOR GATE — the `SetField` turn runs through the real executor
//!      (which enforces the cell's `Permissions` + the whole-turn guarantees).
//!
//! This module is gpui-FREE and `cargo test`-able (the buffer model is built
//! purely from the `World` + a [`SurfaceCapability`]). The cockpit maps
//! [`BufferView`] onto a simple gpui text panel (the IDE's editor pane).
