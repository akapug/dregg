//! THE TEMPORAL COCKPIT model — the gpui-free brain behind the "⏳ TIME" tab.
//!
//! The headline livability surface of deos: time-travel + suspend + fractal
//! meta-debug, as ONE control panel. This module is the pure projection the
//! cockpit's TIME tab renders — exactly the `reflect::Inspectable` /
//! [`crate::ui_snapshot`] / [`crate::meta_debug`] pattern: a gpui-free model the
//! view paints, so it is `cargo test`-able without a window.
//!
//! It REUSES the real models, never a parallel one:
//!
//!   * the REWIND SCRUBBER reads [`World::recorded_turns`] — the live world's own
//!     canonical [`crate::replay::History`] — and lands each tick by ROOT-VERIFIED
//!     [`History::replay_to`](crate::replay::History::replay_to). The
//!     [`Liveness`](crate::ui_snapshot::Liveness) badge is the rehydration model's
//!     honest trichotomy: [`Liveness::Live`] at the head, [`Liveness::ReplayedDeterministic`]
//!     in the past (the camera re-ran from the witnessed log).
//!   * the SUSPEND readout reads the M5 gate on [`World`] directly
//!     ([`World::is_suspended`], [`World::pending_turns`]) — the head is FROZEN and
//!     the staged continuation is the real pending queue.
//!   * the METASTACK breadcrumb reads [`crate::meta_debug::MetaStack`] — the
//!     lazily-materialized reflective tower (BASE → meta¹ → meta² …).
//!
//! The cockpit owns the mutable state (the scrubber cursor, the `MetaStack`) and
//! drives the real `World` gate (`suspend`/`resume`); this module turns a snapshot
//! of that state into a model. `present` stays pure: building a model NEVER mutates
//! the world.
