//! Surfaces — cap-confined cell views (the apps-as-cells primitive).
//!
//! The desktop-OS pillar: every dregg CELL can be opened as its own SURFACE (a
//! window) in the shell. A surface is not a free-floating widget — it is OWNED
//! via a [`SurfaceCapability`], and only the cap-holder may render or drive it.
//! This is the ocap discipline the rest of dregg runs, applied to the *window
//! manager itself*: there is no ambient authority to raise, move, focus, or
//! close a window — you must present the capability that authorizes it.
//!
//! **The capability is the REAL `dregg_firmament` capability** (`docs/
//! DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md` §1, §7): a window IS a
//! [`Capability`](dregg_firmament::Capability) over a
//! [`Target::Surface(cell)`](dregg_firmament::Target::Surface). Holding /
//! attenuating / delegating / revoking a window is exactly holding /
//! attenuating / delegating / revoking that cap, through the SAME
//! `granted ⊆ held` ([`is_attenuation`](dregg_firmament::is_attenuation)) gate
//! and the SAME real [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor`] as every other dregg cap. We
//! do NOT keep a parallel bearer-secret model — window authority rides the
//! firmament fabric the local and distributed backings already proved. (§7 "the
//! one latent divergence to close": the secret model is GONE.)
//!
//! A surface is backed by a REAL cell (`CellId`) viewed through the embedded
//! [`World`](crate::world::World): its title, its trusted-path identity label,
//! and its body all read the live ledger — there are NO mock surfaces. When a
//! turn changes the cell, the surface re-reads and reflects it. (Authority is
//! the firmament cap over the surface's *backing* cell; identity is shell-drawn
//! from the live world — two distinct ledgers, two distinct roles.)
//!
//! This module is gpui-free and `cargo test`-able. The shell ([`crate::shell`])
//! owns the surfaces + the z-order + the firmament surface-fabric the caps are
//! checked against; the cockpit maps the shell's composed scene onto gpui.
