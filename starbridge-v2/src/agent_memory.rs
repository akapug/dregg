//! **AGENT MEMORY AS A umem — checkpoint → handoff → resume on the LIVE path.**
//!
//! THE REVOLUTION, MADE LOAD-BEARING (the agent-memory sibling of the time-travel
//! scrub's `reify_ledger` boundary restore, `b1bd3305`). A confined agent's
//! working-set IS its cell's state on the live [`World`] — its counter, its balance,
//! its nonce, its committed heap, its mandate. [`dregg_turn::umem::project_cell`]
//! lands that whole working-set at `(domain, collection, key) ↦ value` cells of the
//! ONE universal address space: a witnessed, portable, comparable object — a **umem**.
//!
//! So a LIVE agent's session can be CHECKPOINTED to a umem-ref ([`AgentMemoryCheckpoint`])
//! and a FRESH agent context reconstituted from it ([`AgentMemoryCheckpoint::resume_into_fresh_world`]),
//! CONTINUING from exactly where it left off — not a reset. The prototype proved this
//! over a standalone `PortableApplet` (`deos-hermes/tests/agent_memory_as_umem.rs`);
//! this lifts the round-trip onto the real verified [`World`] the cockpit drives, the
//! SAME World a [`crate::agent_attach::attach_agent`]'d confined agent fires onto (a
//! `deos-js` `AttachedApplet::fire` is a thin wrapper over [`World::commit_turn`]).
//!
//! This is pure app/wiring: `project_cell` (checkpoint) + `reify_cell` (resume) +
//! [`World::try_genesis_install`] (reconstitute) over the per-cell umem Stage A already
//! proved. **No new kernel effect** — the agent's memory is the projection of state it
//! already owns, and the resume is the `reify_cell` inverse fold the umem boundary
//! supplies, fail-closed under the SAME anti-substitution root tooth
//! ([`dregg_cell::Ledger::root`]) the persist/replay/time-travel lane uses.
