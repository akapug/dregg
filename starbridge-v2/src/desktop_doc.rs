//! THE DESKTOP IS A DOCUMENT — the cockpit adapter that maps the live scene onto
//! the green, isolation-tested `dregg_doc::desktop` projection.
//!
//! ember's reading: *"the whole starbridge is kinda like a cell document."* The
//! WELD logic + its both-polarity tests live in `dregg_doc::desktop` (the document
//! crate, which builds standalone — so the projection is verified against the REAL
//! `substrate_commit` without the gpui toolchain). THIS module is the thin
//! cockpit-side adapter: it converts the cockpit's live
//! [`compositor::CompositedSurface`] + [`view_cell::WorkspaceCell`] into the
//! renderer-agnostic [`dregg_doc::desktop::DesktopSurface`] and delegates.
//!
//! Why this is the *reflexive* reading (not a gimmick): the cockpit's scene is
//! ALREADY an ordered graph of cells — [`compositor::CompositorScene`] is an
//! ordered list of [`compositor::CompositedSurface`], each `(owner: CellId, …,
//! z_layer, focus_flag)`, and the workspace's UI state is ALREADY cell-backed
//! ([`view_cell::WorkspaceCell`] / [`view_cell::ViewCell`], each itself
//! `Presentable`). Projecting it as a document just *names* that graph as a
//! `dregg_doc` document, so the desktop becomes shareable / rehydratable /
//! branchable / diffable / time-travellable through the SAME machinery a prose
//! document is, and a multi-device focus/tab contention becomes a *first-class
//! conflict state* (the firmament dual of the compositor's T3 focus-exclusive
//! refusal). See `docs/deos/DOC-CELL-COMPOSITION.md`.
//!
//! The reflexive loop's executor cut-over (a layout edit as a witnessed turn)
//! rides [`view_cell::WorkspaceCell::commit`], already a real `Effect::SetField`
//! turn — so authoring the desktop-document closes back into the live image.

// ── THE COMPOSED READING — the desktop as a GRAPH OF CELLS ────────────────────
//
// The delegation above (`scene_to_doc` / `desktop_commit`) reads the live scene as
// the FLAT projection: text atoms `owner ‖ root ‖ digest` chained in z-order, with
// the tab/focus as single-valued fields. That is the right shape for the *commitment*
// (two parties agree on one heap root) but it flattens every window into bytes.
//
// THIS is the sharper convergence ember named — *"documents composed FROM cells:
// include WHOLE cells, nest cells, be a composition of cells."* The cockpit's scene is
// ALREADY a graph of cells (`CompositorScene` = ordered `CompositedSurface`, each an
// `(owner: CellId, z_layer, focus_flag)`), so we project it through the SAME
// `Op::Embed` composition algebra a composed prose document uses
// ([`dregg_doc::composition`], §6). Each window becomes an `Op::Embed` of its OWNER
// cell — the desktop is a layout graph PLUS, by reference, each window's cell. It
// therefore inherits, through the SAME fold ([`composition::content_composed`]):
//
//   · the per-viewer membrane — an out-of-cap window DARKENS (citation kept, content
//     withheld, never forged), the firmament fog-of-war ON the desktop;
//   · forkability / time-travel — the layout graph is a `merge`-able pushout, so two
//     devices' window placements merge (a same-position fork is a first-class layout
//     conflict, not a silent loss);
//   · the cycle guard — a window mirroring the whole desktop trips it, never a stack
//     overflow (the reflexive self-hosting image is a *state*, not a crash);
//   · the reflexive edit — closing a window is an `Op::Remove` on the projected layout
//     ([`composition::close_surface`]), the embed grammar editing the document that IS
//     the desktop.
//
// The bridge is the `CellId` reduction: the cockpit's 32-byte `dregg_cell::CellId`
// folds to the composition crate's `composition::CellId(u128)` deterministically (a
// full-width fold — every byte participates, so the anti-forge tooth survives: two
// distinct windows do not collide). The window's CONTENT (its cell's sub-document) is
// resolved by a `ChildResolver`; here we use the standalone `workspace_resolver` shape
// (the substrate resolver plugs the real `dregg://` read + `Membrane::project` in its
// place, exactly as `cell_transclusion.rs` does for a single whole-cell embed).
