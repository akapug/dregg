//! The dregg cockpit's resizable-split + dock engine.
//!
//! VENDORED-AND-ADAPTED from Zed's `crates/workspace` (rev `407a6ff`), shorn of
//! the editor/project/collab world so it depends only on `gpui` + a local
//! [`theme`]. It hosts arbitrary cockpit surfaces ([`CockpitSurface`]) in
//! resizable, splittable, dockable panes — the substrate for turning the
//! cockpit's flat 28-tab right pane into a Pharo-style multiplicity of live
//! inspectors.
//!
//! Layout:
//!   * [`surface`] — [`CockpitSurface`], the slim ~8-method item trait (the
//!     cockpit analogue of Zed's ~60-method `ItemHandle`). A `*_panel(cx)` body
//!     becomes one of these.
//!   * [`pane`] — [`Pane`], a gpui entity holding a tabbed list of surfaces with
//!     a swappable tab-bar renderer (the ~15% core of Zed's `Pane`).
//!   * [`pane_group`] — [`PaneGroup`]/[`Member`]/[`PaneAxis`]/[`SplitDirection`]
//!     + the custom `PaneAxisElement`: the recursive resizable-split tree with
//!       the draggable divider (the ~90%-as-is engine).
//!   * [`dock`] — [`Dock`]/[`DockPosition`]/[`DockPanel`]/[`DraggedDock`]: the
//!     Left/Bottom/Right edge container with its 6px resize handle (slim).
//!
//! NOT yet wired into `cockpit.rs` (a sibling agent owns that file); this module
//! is self-contained and compiling, ready to integrate as a clean next step.
//! See the migration note in the module that mounts it.

// The gpui-bearing dock engine (theme/pane/split-tree/tearoff). These need gpui,
// so they compile only on the gpui paths. The `migrate` verb below is gpui-FREE
// (it depends only on the firmament cap), so it stays available on the gpui-free
// `process-pd` live-transport path too (this whole module is now reachable under
// `process-pd` for `Shell::migrate_surface`; only these gpui members are gated).
