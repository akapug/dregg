//! **SYMBOLIC EXECUTION** — the deferred-witness fast path and its collapse orchestrator.
//!
//! Extracted verbatim from `world/mod.rs` so the witness/cost track owns a file rather than
//! a line-range. No behaviour change. A CHILD module, so it keeps private access to
//! `World`'s fields (`symbolic_turns`, `witness_mode`, `history`, `record_exec`,
//! `record_ledger`, `receipts`, `engine`) exactly as it had inline.
//!
//! The thesis is sound and proved: the witness layer is what a REMOTE light client needs to
//! be convinced, not what the local state transition needs to happen
//! (`turn/src/collapse.rs`, grounded in `metatheory/Dregg2/Spec/ExecRefinement.lean`).
//! Admission gates are mode-independent — a turn rejected in Full is rejected in Symbolic.
//!
//! ⚑ THREE UNSOUNDNESSES BLOCK MAKING SYMBOLIC THE DEFAULT. All three are repairs owed
//! before any flip, and all three fail QUIETLY:
//!   1. Durable recovery replays through `commit_turn`; under a symbolic default it buffers
//!      instead of recording the tape, and the fail-closed root check still PASSES because
//!      it compares ABSTRACT state, which Symbolic preserves exactly. You reopen into an
//!      empty `History` with every receipt a sentinel, and no error.
//!   2. `collapse` overwrites the provenance log with the RECORDER's receipts but never
//!      re-syncs the ENGINE's per-agent receipt head, so the next live turn links to a hash
//!      no receipt carries. (`turn/src/collapse.rs`'s own `collapse_with` DOES call
//!      `set_last_receipt_hash`; this path takes `History::record_commit` and skips it.)
//!   3. `DEFERRED_STATE_HASH` is all-zeros, a receipt carrying it is VALIDLY SIGNED, and
//!      nothing refuses it: `is_deferred` has zero callers in `turn/src/verify.rs`, and its
//!      only non-test callers tree-wide are two `debug_assert!`s — compiled out in release.
