//! **THE OUT-OF-BAND GENESIS-PATH MUTATORS** — ledger writes that do NOT ride a turn.
//!
//! Extracted from `world/mod.rs` so the reactivity track owns a file rather than
//! a line-range. A CHILD module, so it keeps private access to
//! `World`'s fields and helpers (`commit_genesis_update`, `genesis_mutation_would_break_reopen`,
//! `ensure_record_ledger`). Updates stage a complete cell and persist it before
//! publishing to either live or replay state. Storage errors require reopen.
//!
//! ⚑ CLOSED 2026-07-31 (lane B1). These four used to mutate the ledger and emit NO
//! `WorldEvent` — the M2 cache-soundness hole: `commit_turn`'s write-set completeness pass
//! tops up events from the executor journal, but these never run `commit_turn` at all, so a
//! memoized projection of a cell they touch went silently stale (the desktop's 250 ms poll
//! papered over it). Each now emits on its SUCCESS LEG, past the reopen guard:
//!   - `set_cell_program` / `genesis_open_permissions` → `CellMutated` (the tooth its own
//!     doc names for a program / permissions write; both are cell-local).
//!   - `genesis_grant_cap` → `CapabilityGranted` (viewer-NON-local: a cap edge changes what
//!     OTHER cells' affordance badges say, which `CellMutated` — naming only the holder —
//!     would leave stale; the cost is `invalidate_affordances_all`, see the call site).
//!   - `set_cell_heap` → `HeapWritten`, NOT `CellMutated`: the doc editor persists per
//!     keystroke and the user cell carries `AGENT_COUNTER_SLOT` (0) + `DOC_REV_SLOT` (14),
//!     so the conservative tooth would light every field bind on every open card. The
//!     variant NAMES its cell (completeness) but the field-bind registries ignore it.
//! ⚠ What is NOT closed: the poll is still the desktop's only wake edge, and
//! `Journal::touched_slots` (the fine-grained slot-level write set) is still absent.
//!
//! ⚠ `set_cell_heap` is the SHIPPING desktop document editor's persist path
//! (`deos_desktop/mod.rs::commit_doc_to_umem_heap`) — and on a DURABLE image it refuses
//! from save #2 onward, because `genesis_mutation_would_break_reopen` sees the doc cell was
//! touched by save #1's own `SetField` turn. The caller then short-circuits on `&&`, so the
//! revision turn does not run either: no heap write, no receipt, no event, and the JSON
//! sidecar becomes the only copy of the prose. Closing that needs an ordered
//! `Effect::SetHeap`; until it exists the sidecar CANNOT be deleted.
//!
//! ⚠ The emit goes AFTER the reopen guard, on the success leg only —
//! `persistence.rs`'s guard tests assert the early-return leg, and an event for a write
//! that did not happen is a spurious invalidation (and a lie in the activity feed). Pinned
//! by `world::tests::a_guard_refused_mutation_emits_nothing` +
//! `world::tests::a_mutator_that_moved_nothing_emits_nothing`.
