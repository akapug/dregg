//! The embedded verified world — the HEART of the master interface.
//!
//! `World` wraps the REAL embedded engine — `dregg_sdk::embed::DreggEngine`
//! (`sdk/src/embed.rs`), the SDK's no-I/O executor+ledger core that the SWAP
//! makes the federation's authoritative producer — and runs REAL verified turns
//! through it (`DreggEngine::execute_turn`, i.e. `TurnExecutor::execute` over a
//! `dregg_cell::Ledger`). It is NOT a client of a remote node, and NOT a
//! parallel re-implementation of that engine: the verified semantics run IN
//! THIS PROCESS, through the SDK's own engine.
//!
//! This module is gpui-free and `cargo test`-able: it is the engine the visual
//! layer renders, decoupled from any window. Every mutation flows through
//! `commit_turn`, which:
//!   1. threads the per-agent receipt-chain head (the executor enforces it),
//!   2. runs `executor.execute(&turn, &mut ledger)`,
//!   3. on `Committed`, records the new chain head + emits a [`WorldEvent`]
//!      stream of the state transition (the "dynamics"), and
//!   4. returns the real [`TurnReceipt`] (kept in an append-only provenance log).
//!
//! The four dregg-surpasses-Smalltalk axes are all live here:
//!   * ocap — turns are gated by the cells' `Permissions`/capabilities; an
//!     over-grant or unauthorized effect is REJECTED by the real executor.
//!   * verification — each commit carries the executor's conservation / no-
//!     amplification guarantees (the same code the verified producer runs).
//!   * provenance — every commit appends a `TurnReceipt` to `receipts`, a
//!     navigable causal chain (the local blocklace).
//!   * distribution — `state_root()` is a cryptographic commitment to the whole
//!     image; the federation view renders this image as one of many sovereign
//!     ones.

// `docs/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3` the KEYSTONE payoff).
//
// `World::commit_turn` runs a turn through the embedded verified executor
// DIRECTLY in-process. `SemihostCockpit` runs the SAME turn through the SAME
// verified executor, but DISPATCHED THROUGH THE SEMIHOST executor-PD: the turn
// is staged into the PD's `turn_in` region, the cockpit (an app-PD) signals the
// executor-PD over an `EmulatedKernel` Endpoint (the `ingress→executor` edge),
// the executor-PD reads `turn_in`, runs the cockpit's REAL `World` commit path,
// writes the `TurnReceipt` into `commit_out`, and replies — and the cockpit
// reads the receipt back out of `commit_out`. This proves the sel4 PD world is
// running underneath: the SAME `World` semantics, now reached through the
// firmament's `turn_in → step → commit_out` cap partition over the n=1
// microkernel — the SAME code path a real seL4 boot would take (only the launch
