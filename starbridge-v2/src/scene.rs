//! THE VERIFIED SCENE — surface `present()` as a REAL verified turn, with teeth.
//!
//! [`crate::compositor`] is the PURE scene-authority model: it decides T1∧T2∧T3
//! (non-overlap · label-binding · focus-exclusivity) in Rust and refuses an
//! overpaint / label-spoof / double-focus in a standalone `Compositor`. That is
//! the executable shadow of the Lean `Dregg2.Apps.Compositor` `AppSpec`, but its
//! admission is decided by a Rust reimplementation of `sceneAdmit` — a PARALLEL
//! gate, not the executor's.
//!
//! This module closes that gap (roadmap N7 — "the transfer-triangle for the
//! desktop"): it makes `present()` a REAL VERIFIED TURN against the embedded
//! [`World`](crate::world::World)'s executor, so the three anti-ghost teeth bite
//! from the SAME production caveat gate that commits a value turn — not from a
//! Rust if-statement. The construction is the Lean one, transposed verbatim:
//!
//!   * A **compositor cell** is a real ledger cell whose [`CellProgram`] is the
//!     baked **admit-table** `AllowedTransitions { slot: present_digest, allowed:
//!     <(old,new) : sceneAdmit … old new> }` — the Rust mirror of the Lean
//!     `compositorSpec.caveats = [.admitTable present_digest …]`. The WHOLE scene
//!     authority (the region→owner map, the focus holder, the presenter's granted
//!     region-set, the genuine owner-label) is CLOSED OVER into that table at
//!     scene-snapshot time, exactly as `ToolAccessDelegation.delegAdmit` closes
//!     over `(toolId, rateLimit, deadline)`.
//!   * A `present()` is the single scalar write `present_digest : old → new`
//!     committed as an [`Effect::SetField`] turn through
//!     [`World::commit_turn`](crate::world::World::commit_turn). The executor's
//!     program-check evaluates the `AllowedTransitions` caveat (the production
//!     `StateConstraint` gate) and COMMITS iff the scene authority admits the
//!     present — and REJECTS (a real [`CommitOutcome::Rejected`]) any overpaint,
//!     label-spoof, or double-focus. **This IS `VerificationToolkit.
//!     app_commit_iff_admit` + `app_violation_rejected`, on glass** — the teeth
//!     come for free from the verified kernel because the present is just a
//!     caveat-gated `SetField`, the SAME gate the toolkit proves over.
//!   * A **surface [`FactoryDescriptor`]** ([`surface_factory`]) mints surface
//!     cells already carrying the present_digest caveat program as a PERPETUAL
//!     slot caveat — apps-as-cells, born from a verified factory with the scene
//!     gate baked in, so a factory-born surface inherits the discipline.
//!
//! A refusal is a FEATURE, surfaced the same way the executor's turn rejections
//! are (the [`PresentVerdict`] carries the tooth that bit). A committed present
//! advances the frame digest in the live scene AND emits a [`WorldEvent::
//! SurfaceDamaged`] on the dynamics stream (the compositor's "damage" — the
//! region that must be repainted).
//!
//! gpui-free and `cargo test`-able under `embedded-executor`. The cockpit's SHELL
//! tab maps the live scene onto gpui; the assurance value is THIS headless model
//! + the teeth that bite through the real executor.
