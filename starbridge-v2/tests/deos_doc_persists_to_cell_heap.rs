//! **A deos document persists to the REAL committed cell umem-heap, not a sidecar.**
//!
//! A dreggverse document IS a cell, and its commitment IS that cell's committed
//! `heap_root` — the per-cell universal-memory boundary (`docs/deos/UMEM-PRIMITIVE.md`
//! §8; `dregg_doc::DocHeapCell`). The desktop projects a document (its atom/edge/field
//! graph AND its verbatim prose) into the cell's `heap_map` and reseals `heap_root`
//! out-of-band (`World::set_cell_heap` — `set_heap` / `reseal_heap_root`, no kernel
//! effect). This test drives that exact project → reseal → read-back path through the
//! real `World` (no gpui), proving:
//!   * a doc edit commits the document INTO the cell's umem-heap (its `heap_root`
//!     boundary MOVES and IS the commitment — `DocHeapCell::commitment()`);
//!   * the prose READS BACK from the committed heap (`dregg_doc::text_from_heap`), and
//!     the projection is genuinely bound by `heap_root` (the membership witness);
//!   * a shrunk revision leaves no stale committed leaf (the heap is rebuilt wholesale);
//!   * reopen restores FROM THE LEDGER's umem boundary (a fresh read, no sidecar).
//!
//! The desktop's `commit_doc_to_umem_heap` / `read_doc_from_heap`
//! (`starbridge-v2/src/deos_desktop/mod.rs`) are thin wrappers over exactly this.
