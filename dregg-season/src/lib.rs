//! # `dregg-season` — THE SEASON ABSTRACTION
//!
//! The operating model for The Descent: it runs as **SEASONS** punctuated by
//! protocol upgrades. This crate ties the already-built upgrade pieces —
//! the epoch handshake ([`dregg_epoch`]), the drift taxonomy
//! (`scripts/classify_descriptor_drift.py`), genesis-from-snapshot
//! ([`dregg_genesis_snapshot`]), and the no-cheat leaderboard ([`ugc_dregg`]) —
//! into one coherent Season.
//!
//! ## What a season is
//!
//! A **season is one VK-epoch's run**. A [`Season`] pins an
//! [`EpochManifest`](dregg_epoch::EpochManifest) (its `registry_fp` is the
//! load-bearing VK-epoch identity), names a **content set** (`content_tag`), and
//! carries a **season-scoped** no-cheat leaderboard — a [`ugc_dregg::Registry`],
//! whose every ranked completion provably reaches the win. State (the board, the
//! characters) is scoped to the season.
//!
//! ## What a season boundary is
//!
//! A **season boundary is an upgrade**, classified by the drift taxonomy into one
//! of two [`DriftClass`]es (the two classes `classify_descriptor_drift.py` emits):
//!
//! * **[`DriftClass::TailAppend`]** — new descriptor rows staged at the tail, no
//!   existing member's geometry moved, the deployed VKs are byte-identical: **no
//!   re-genesis**. [`advance_season`] **CONTINUES the same season** — the
//!   `season_id` is unchanged, the leaderboard and characters persist, and only the
//!   epoch tag bumps. A non-breaking upgrade.
//! * **[`DriftClass::GeometryWiden`]** — an existing cohort member's geometry moved
//!   (`trace_width` / the shared PI prefix / membership), so the deployed VK bytes
//!   change and every light client must re-key: a **re-genesis flag-day**. This is
//!   a new VK-epoch — [`advance_season`] **ENDS the season and begins a NEW one**
//!   (a fresh `season_id` + the new epoch, a fresh empty leaderboard).
//!
//! The registry-fingerprint move IS the boundary: a tail-append keeps
//! `registry_fp` ([`dregg_epoch::check_compatibility`] returns `Compatible` — the
//! same VK-epoch); a geometry-widen moves it (`RegistryFpMismatch` — a different
//! VK-epoch). [`epoch_delta_class`] reads exactly this, so the epoch handshake and
//! the drift class agree.
//!
//! ## What carries forward across a boundary
//!
//! A season boundary carries **exactly the opt-in legacy** and resets the rest. The
//! [`CarryForwardPolicy`] decides:
//!
//! * a **HALL-OF-FAME** — the prior season's top-N [`Champion`]s, a durable record
//!   of who won; and/or
//! * a **PRESTIGE** badge — a per-identity, cross-season marker that accrues each
//!   season an identity reaches the hall-of-fame.
//!
//! Both are carried via a real [`GenesisSnapshot`](dregg_genesis_snapshot::GenesisSnapshot)
//! export→seed: each champion / prestige badge is encoded as a content-addressed
//! [`Cell`](dregg_cell::Cell), frozen into a snapshot targeting the new season's
//! genesis, and seeded (validated) into it. The carry therefore **rides
//! genesis-snapshot's tamper-refusal**: a forged hall-of-fame entry (a mutated
//! cell) breaks the migration-voucher binding and is refused on seed. Meanwhile the
//! **active leaderboard and characters RESET** — the new season starts on a fresh
//! empty board.
//!
//! So: a season runs, an upgrade either continues or ends it, and a season boundary
//! carries forward exactly the opt-in legacy while resetting the rest.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! REAL here: the season model, the drift-classified boundary (tail-append
//! continues; geometry-widen ends + carries-forward-the-legacy + resets), and the
//! carry-forward over the already-built pieces — driven end-to-end over the real
//! no-cheat board and the real tamper-refusing snapshot.
//!
//! NAMED RESIDUALS (not built here):
//! * **the live wiring** — the bot / node reading the *current* season, and the
//!   operator advancing a season at a real upgrade (feeding the classifier's verdict
//!   into [`advance_season`]);
//! * **the season CONTENT set** — the per-season content ([`SeasonManifest::content_tag`]
//!   is the id; swapping in the actual content is the residual);
//! * **the season schedule / UX** — when a season starts/ends and how it is surfaced.
