//! The **substance** the native runtime drives — a minimal cell-applet over the

//!
//! This is the engine-independent half: it knows nothing about JS. It mints a cell on
//! a fresh [`DreggEngine`], registers a small declarative affordance surface, and
//! [`CellApplet::fire`]s a named affordance as a REAL cap-gated verified turn — the
//! SAME path `deos-js::applet::Applet::fire` runs (cap tooth → executor → receipt). The
//! `boa` runtime in [`crate::runtime`] is a thin bridge onto this surface, so a cell's
//! attached JS commits verified turns exactly as a static `{turn,arg}` button does.
