//! THE PURE-JS KVSTORE, PROVEN BY RUNNING: the `starbridge-kvstore` service cell rebuilt as
//! pure JavaScript-on-cells, driven through the native runtime (pure-Rust `boa`, NO servo,
//! NO SpiderMonkey/mozjs). The JS names **typed methods** on the store's PUBLISHED
//! [`InterfaceDescriptor`] — resolved through the verified DFA `route_method`, the SAME
//! dispatch `dregg_app_framework::invoke()` speaks — and writes the JS-supplied value to a
//! JS-supplied register through the literal-write `ApplyOp`. Every mutation is a REAL
//! cap-gated verified turn.
//!
//! This is the two named power-ups landed end-to-end:
//!   1. **literal / register-addressed writes** ([`ApplyOp::SetRegisterFromArgs`]): `put(reg,
//!      value)` writes `value` to register `reg` EXACTLY (overwrite semantics), instead of
//!      riding `AddToSlot` over a zeroed slot — so a JS affordance reaches an arbitrary
//!      register with an arbitrary value;
//!   2. **the route_method bridge** (`CellWorld::publish_interface`): `tCell("store","put",..)`
//!      resolves `put` against the store's published typed interface — an undeclared method
//!      is fail-closed, a `Serviced` method (`get`) is refused as a non-turn read, and the
//!      cap requirement is the published `MethodSig`'s, exactly as the real kvstore.
//!
//! The behavior is checked against the Rust `starbridge-kvstore` shape: `put` is a
//! `Signature`-gated `Replayable` write of `value` into register `reg`; `get` is a
//! `Serviced` read (the named OFE seam invoke() refuses to desugar); the register holds the
//! written value; an over-reach (a method the interface does not route, or a cap the app
//! does not hold) commits nothing.
