//! THE PURE-JS 2-PARTY ESCROW, PROVEN BY RUNNING: a single JavaScript program — run in
//! the NATIVE runtime (pure-Rust `boa`, NO servo, NO SpiderMonkey/mozjs) — drives a whole
//! value-coordinating ESCROW across THREE cells: a buyer (`alice`), a seller (`bob`), and
//! the `escrow` coordinator that holds the funds in flight. The app
//!
//!   1. **arms** the escrow with the agreed price through a TYPED method
//!      (`tCell("escrow", "arm", price)`, routed through the escrow's published
//!      [`InterfaceDescriptor`] via the verified DFA `route_method`, `Signature`-gated),
//!   2. **funds** it — `transfer("alice", "escrow", price)` moves the buyer's value into
//!      the escrow, conservation enforced by the executor,
//!   3. **settles** — `tCell("escrow", "settle")` flips the escrow state machine through a
//!      second typed turn, then
//!   4. **pays out** — the payout amount is READ BACK OFF the committed escrow state
//!      (`get("escrow", AMOUNT_SLOT)`) and `transfer("escrow", "bob", owed)` releases it to
//!      the seller.
//!
//! Every effect is a REAL cap-gated verified turn through the embedded executor. This is
//! the second, MORE COMPLEX pure-JS app (after the single-cell kvstore): it coordinates
//! THREE cells, moves value TWICE through an intermediary, drives a typed-method state
//! machine, and reads committed cross-cell state to decide the payout — all with no ambient
//! authority, the app naming cells only by the handles the cap table installed.
//!
//! Proven here:
//!   (a) the happy path SETTLES and CONSERVES — value genuinely moves alice -> escrow ->
//!       bob, and the three-cell balance sum equals the initial sum minus the burned
//!       per-turn fees (no value created or destroyed);
//!   (b) a `reclaim` instead of a settle REFUNDS the depositor — the held value returns to
//!       alice and bob never receives it;
//!   (c) an UNAUTHORIZED release leg is refused IN-BAND — when the app holds only a
//!       `Signature` toward the escrow but the published `settle` method requires the
//!       stronger `Proof`, the settle is refused (`Unauthorized`), the funds stay LOCKED in
//!       the escrow, and nothing reaches bob;
//!   (d) a drain to an UNHELD party is refused IN-BAND — `transfer("escrow", "mallory", ..)`
//!       to a cell the app holds no cap to is `NoCapability`, the escrow funds are untouched,
//!       and a legitimate payout still commits afterward.
//!
//! THE COMPOUND/CONDITIONAL-TURN POWER-UP (the gap, now CLOSED — tests (e)..(g2)): the
//! `batch(actor, specJson)` host fn fires an ATOMIC, STATE-GUARDED, COMPOUND turn — ONE
//! verified turn carrying an optional GUARD (a kernel `require_field_equals` precondition on
//! the actor's state, checked AHEAD of every effect and bound into the action commitment, so
//! a LIGHT CLIENT witnesses the "only-if") and an ordered list of legs (transfers + slot
//! writes) that commit ATOMICALLY (all-or-none, via the executor's per-action journal). The
//! escrow's "release = only-if-SETTLED ∧ transfer to seller" is now ONE turn the kernel
//! commits whole or refuses whole:
//!   (e) a guarded release commits IFF the escrow is SETTLED — one atomic witnessed turn;
//!   (f) a guarded release attempted when NOT settled is refused ATOMICALLY (Precondition
//!       failed) — no transfer, no partial release, no receipt;
//!   (g) a compound `settle ∧ pay` commits as ONE receipt (multi-leg atomicity), and
//!   (g2) all-or-none holds — a compound whose transfer leg over-draws rolls back the state
//!       flip too: nothing commits.
//!
//! NAMED SEAM (honest, narrow): the kernel primitive is `Preconditions` + per-action
//! atomicity — STRONGER than a bolt-on `Effect::ConditionalBatch` would be (both are already
//! kernel-enforced AND in the action commitment). The one limit is that the guard reads the
//! ACTOR's own state (the precondition evaluates against `action.target`); a cross-cell
//! guard (commit on cell B, act on cell A) would need a `witnessed`-clause precondition or a
//! multi-party atomic turn. For the escrow the guard cell and the value-source are the same
//! cell, so the release is fully covered.
