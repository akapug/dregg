//! THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, PROVEN BY RUNNING: a tiny cell-JS handler, run in the NATIVE
//! runtime (pure-Rust `boa`, NO servo, NO SpiderMonkey/mozjs), fires a REAL cap-gated
//! verified turn through the executor and the model advances.
//!
//! This closes the gap the work targets: cell-attached JS that runs in the cockpit
//! (gpui native), not just the web shell. The host fn `t(turn, arg)` the JS calls is
//! the SAME cap-gated verified-turn path a static `{turn,arg}` button runs.
