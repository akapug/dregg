//! THE PURE-JS SEALED-BID AUCTION, PROVEN BY RUNNING: a single JavaScript program — run in
//! the NATIVE runtime (pure-Rust `boa`, NO servo, NO SpiderMonkey/mozjs) — drives a whole
//! MULTI-PARTY, COMMIT-REVEAL sealed-bid auction across FIVE cells: three competing bidders
//! (`alice`, `bob`, `carol`), the awarding `seller`, and the `auction` coordinator that holds
//! the sealed board + the lifecycle phase. This is the THIRD and hardest pure-JS app (after
//! the single-cell kvstore and the two-party escrow): several parties COMPETE for one award
//! by sealing hidden bids, then OPENING them under a runtime-enforced binding, after which the
//! highest committed-and-revealed bid wins and SETTLES.
//!
//! It mirrors the real `starbridge-apps/sealed-auction` shape (the executable surface of the
//! Lean `Dregg2/Intent/SealedAuction.lean`), and the SAME guarantees that development proves
//! are exercised here AS PURE JS:
//!
//!   | Lean keystone                | proven by running here                                |
//!   |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
//!   | `reveal_binds_committed`     | (b) a switched value's reveal is refused IN-BAND.     |
//!   | `uncommitted_cannot_open`    | (c) a non-committed party cannot reveal.              |
//!   | anti-front-running (WriteOnce)| (d) a committed bid cannot be overwritten.            |
//!   | `reveal_requires_reveal_phase`| (e) a reveal before the commit phase closes is refused.|
//!   | `winner_was_committed`       | (a) the winner's value came from a bound reveal.      |
//!   | `settle_conserves`           | (a) value is conserved (only per-turn fees burned).   |
//!   | settlement confinement       | (f) the payout cannot drain to an unheld party.       |
//!
//! THE POWER-UP THIS APP NEEDED (added to the runtime host API): a **commit-reveal helper**.
//! No existing primitive could enforce that a reveal BINDS to its sealed commitment — and a
//! binding the JS computed and the JS checked would enforce nothing (a malicious script would
//! just write whatever). So the RUNTIME owns the seal:
//!
//!   - `seal(bidder, value, nonce)` — a pure host fn returning the BLAKE3 sealed commitment
//!     (the SAME construction the real `Bid::seal` uses). A bidder publishes ONLY this digest
//!     at commit time; the secret value/nonce stay in JS variables until reveal.
//!   - `commitSeal(auction, {slot, seal, guard?})` — freeze a sealed bid as ONE cap-gated
//!     verified turn; WRITE-ONCE (no overwriting a committed bid) + an optional phase guard.
//!   - `revealBid(auction, {sealSlot, revealSlot, bidder, value, nonce, guard?})` — open a
//!     bid; the runtime RE-HASHES the opening and refuses one that does not bind to the frozen
//!     seal (the keystone binding tooth), optionally phase-guarded. The revealed value is
//!     written as a verified turn.
//!
//! Every effect is a REAL cap-gated verified turn through the embedded executor; the app names
//! cells only by the handles the cap table installed (no ambient cell ids), and the binding /
//! phase / write-once / confinement teeth all bite in-band.
