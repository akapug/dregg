//! THE PREDICATE-GATE FORGERY CANARY — the falsifier for the SDK verifier's fact-commitment gate.
//!
//! ## The statement under test
//!
//! `dregg_bridge::verify_predicate_proof(proof, expected_fact_commitment)` proves:
//!
//! > "the value covered by `expected_fact_commitment` satisfies the predicate."
//!
//! The descriptor's value↔fact weld (`circuit/tests/predicate_arith_fact_weld_canary.rs`) supplies
//! half of that: the compared value is forced to be the one the PRESENTED commitment covers. The
//! other half is the verifier's: `expected_fact_commitment` must come from token state the verifier
//! trusts. The SDK used to feed that parameter `pred_proof.fact_commitment` — the proof's OWN
//! commitment — collapsing the gate to `x != x`. Always false. Never rejects. The weld then binds
//! the value to a fact the PROVER chose, and the forgery just moves up one level: pick a fact you
//! like, prove a true statement about it, present it as a statement about token state.
//!
//! ## The falsifier
//!
//! [`forged_commitment_is_accepted_by_the_self_fed_gate_and_refused_by_the_derived_one`] builds a
//! genuine, internally-consistent proof about a fact the prover INVENTED (`score = 999`) while the
//! verifier's trusted state says `score = 300`. It drives BOTH feeds over that one proof:
//!
//! * the `x != x` self-feed (the exact expression that was at `sdk/src/verify.rs:379`) → ACCEPTED;
//! * the derived feed (`AgentCipherclerk::derive_fact_commitment` from trusted state) → REFUSED.
//!
//! Both poles in one test, so neither can pass vacuously: the canary IS the restore-the-old-feed
//! experiment, run on every test invocation rather than by hand.
//!
//! [`honest_predicate_proof_verifies_against_derived_commitment`] pins the completeness pole (the
//! derived feed must still ACCEPT the honest proof), and
//! [`the_four_term_kinds_round_trip_or_fail_loud`] pins the unified reduction that makes the honest
//! pole reachable at all.
