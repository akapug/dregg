//! # THE WIDE PRODUCER→EXECUTOR PIPELINE (STAGED — the faithful-commitment flip, de-risked).
//!
//! Proves the WHOLE flag-day pipeline end-to-end at the WIDE 8-felt geometry, ADDITIVELY (the live
//! 1-felt path in `sovereign_rotated_c1.rs` is UNTOUCHED). The flip is now a mechanical switch — this
//! test demonstrates each leg already coheres:
//!
//!   * **PRODUCER leg** (`full_turn_proof::prove_effect_vm_rotated_wide`): mints a real wide
//!     `Ir2BatchProof` over the WIDE descriptor (`WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` = the verified Lean
//!     `v3RegistryCapOpenWide`), publishing the 16 wide commit PIs (the 8-felt BEFORE/AFTER commits).
//!   * **EXECUTOR leg** (mirrored here): reconstructs the trusted before/after cell state, computes
//!     the chip-faithful 8-felt commit (`poseidon2::wire_commit_8_chip` — the byte-twin of the
//!     circuit's `fill_wide_block`) over each cell's `compute_rotated_pre_limbs`, OVERRIDES the 16
//!     wide PIs with those trusted commits, and `verify_vm_descriptor2` ACCEPTS — exactly the wide
//!     analog of the live executor's `dpis[V1_PI_COUNT]/[+1]` override (the 1-felt-retire the flip
//!     performs). Those were `[42]/[43]` until the 2026-08-07 seven-slot PI compaction.
//!   * **THE FORGERY TOOTH**: a forged trusted commit (a state the kernel never produced) makes the
//!     anchored 16 wide PIs disagree with the proof's bound carrier ⇒ `verify_vm_descriptor2` UNSAT.
//!
//! So the flag-day = repoint the sovereign producer + executor onto these wide legs + re-emit/re-pin
//! the VK (atomic, ember-gated). This test proves the legs are green BEFORE that switch flips.
//!
//! Requires `prover` (the wide producer + verifier). Self-skips under `not(prover)`.
