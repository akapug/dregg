//! # GENTIAN deployed-registry VERIFY — the FORGE (the decider), CLOSED.
//!
//! The meta-review flagged a registry mismatch: the flag-day capacity-floor REFUSE
//! (`gentianDeployedBareRefuse`, `EffectVmEmitRotationV3Refused.v3RegistryRefused`) was welded onto the
//! **V3 1-felt** cohort ONLY. But the DEPLOYED light-client verify path — the SDK wire verifier
//! [`dregg_sdk::full_turn_proof::verify_effect_vm_rotated_with_cutover`] and the executor
//! `verify_one_cohort_run` — resolves the **WIDE / WELDED** registries
//! (`WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` + `WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_TSV`), so a declared-capacity cell settling via
//! a plain BARE wide leg bound the (refuse-free) WIDE bare member and was ACCEPTED — the open dodge.
//!
//! THE FIX (option a — the wide VK epoch): the capacity-floor refuse is now lifted to ride the WIDE /
//! WELDED bare cohort too (`Dregg2.Deos.BareCohortFloorRefuseWide.gentianWideBareRefuse`, aux blocks PAST
//! the wide member width; `declared_capacity_unsat_wide`), emitted onto exactly the 36 bare cohort
//! members and regenerated into `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` / `WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_TSV`. The Rust
//! `fill_refuse_aux` fills the wide aux base (`trace_width − 3·REFUSE_STRIDE`).
//!
//! THIS FORGE now DECIDES the flip: a cell whose caveat manifest DECLARES the escrow capacity (tag 17,
//! folded into caveatCommit PI 45) and settles via a plain bare-cohort `Burn` is REJECTED by the deployed
//! entry `verify_effect_vm_rotated_with_cutover` — the honest producer path is UNSAT under the
//! refuse-welded member (floor=1 → the floor==0 gate), and a genuine PRE-FLIP bare-dodge STARK binds NO
//! deployed cohort descriptor. A NON-declaring normal turn still verifies (completeness/liveness). If the
//! deployed LC ever ACCEPTS the declared-capacity bare dodge again, the refuse regressed off the deployed
//! WIDE/WELDED registries.
//!
//! Requires `prover`; self-skips under `not(prover)`. SLOW (real batch STARK).
