//! High-level privacy APIs for application developers.
//!
//! This module provides ergonomic wrappers around dregg's privacy primitives,
//! making it simple to perform common privacy-preserving operations:
//!
//! - **Anonymous authorization**: Prove you are authorized without revealing your identity.
//! - **Private notes**: Create and transfer value without revealing amounts.
//! - **Unlinkable predicates**: Prove facts about yourself that can't be correlated.
//! - **Private discovery**: Find matching intents without revealing your query.
//! - **Non-revocation proofs**: Prove your token hasn't been revoked without revealing it.
//!
//! # Design Principles
//!
//! Each API method documents:
//! - What **privacy guarantee** it provides (what's hidden from the verifier).
//! - What **the verifier learns** (the public inputs / revealed information).
//! - What **stays hidden** (the private witness / secret data).
