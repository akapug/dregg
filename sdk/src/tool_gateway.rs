//! # ORGAN 4 — THE GATEWAY: a live tool-calling agent becomes a mandated inhabitant.
//!
//! A clean Rust seam that turns an inbound, untrusted tool-call into a
//! cap-gated, metered, receipted DELEGATED turn on the verified executor — or an
//! IN-BAND refusal. Any external loop (a buildr agent, a hermes agent, an MCP
//! host) drives it through one method: [`ToolGateway::invoke`]. The gateway holds
//! no policy of its own; the GRANTOR pins the mandate ([`ToolGrant`]) at
//! delegation time, and every call is admitted IFF the delegated policy admits
//! it.
//!
//! ## What this welds (REUSE, not rebuild)
//!
//! * The PROVEN admission crown — `metatheory/Dregg2/Apps/ToolAccessDelegation.lean`:
//!   `delegAdmit g now tool old new = SCOPE ∧ DEADLINE ∧ rate(new = old+1 ∧ 0 ≤ old ∧ new ≤ rateLimit)`,
//!   and `tool_invocation_commit_iff_admit` (the executor's caveat gate commits a
//!   metered `calls_made : c → c+1` write IFF that predicate holds), with the
//!   over-rate / past-deadline / out-of-scope rejection TEETH. [`deleg_admit`] in
//!   this module is the byte-faithful Rust mirror of that Lean predicate; the
//!   `tool_gateway_admit_mirrors_lean_delegadmit` test pins the SAME decision
//!   vector the Lean `#guard`s witness.
//! * The cap-gated executor path — [`crate::SubAgent`] / [`crate::AgentRuntime::spawn_sub_agent_scoped`]:
//!   the worker carries a public-key biscuit credential scoped to EXACTLY the
//!   granted tool method, presented as `Authorization::Token`, so the EXECUTOR
//!   (`verify_token_authorization`) — not an out-of-band `cap.verify()` — admits
//!   the metered write. A call under any other method is rejected by the executor
//!   with `TokenInsufficientCapability`.
//!
//! ## The two enforcement surfaces, both load-bearing
//!
//! A tool invocation is a single scalar write: the worker cell's `calls_made`
//! slot advances `c → c+1`. Admission folds the WHOLE delegated policy:
//!
//! 1. **In-band, before submission** — [`deleg_admit`] decides SCOPE ∧ DEADLINE ∧
//!    RATE exactly as the Lean predicate. A FALSE verdict is a
//!    [`GatewayRefusal`] returned as an `Err` (the anti-ghost tooth — a `Result`
//!    error, NEVER a panic, and NO turn is submitted, so no spend, no counter
//!    advance).
//! 2. **In the executor** — the worker cell carries a [`mandate_program`]
//!    (`FieldLte { calls_made ≤ rateLimit }` ∧ `Monotonic { calls_made }`): even
//!    if a caller bypassed [`deleg_admit`], the executor's own cell-program check
//!    rejects an over-rate or rolled-back counter write. The rate ceiling is
//!    bound into the committed transition, not merely pre-checked.
//!
//! A granted call therefore COMMITS with a receipt and a conserved spend (the
//! counter moves, total balance does not), and an out-of-mandate call is REFUSED
//! in-band — the exact both-polarity shape the Lean crown proves.
//!
//! ## The DATA PLANE — the gateway as a ROUTER, not only a gate
//!
//! [`ToolGateway::invoke`] gates + meters + executes INLINE (synchronous). But a
//! real data plane ROUTES the call: the gate is the on-ramp, not the whole road.
//! [`ToolGateway::enqueue`] runs the SAME admission/metering gate, then ENQUEUES
//! the admitted tool-call onto the gateway's inbox toward an EXECUTION
//! ENVIRONMENT (the worker's executor cell), returning a non-blocking
//! [`RoutedHandle`] (an `EventualRef`-shaped promise) INSTEAD of blocking. The
//! executor later DRAINS the queue ([`ToolGateway::drive_executor`]), runs the
//! metered turn, and the RESULT comes back as a resolved promise plus a
//! [`DeliveryReceipt`] (custody-receipt-shaped: a signed-shape witness that the
//! work was dequeued toward, and executed by, the executor). The caller
//! [`poll`](RoutedHandle::status)s / [`resolve`](ToolGateway::resolve)s the
//! handle to collect the [`RoutedResult`].
//!
//! So the full road is: **admit → enqueue → (execute elsewhere) → results-back**,
//! with the metering + receipts intact, and a refusal short-circuiting at the
//! on-ramp (no enqueue, no spend, no counter advance).
//!
//! The promise/result channel reuses the verified [`PendingTurnRegistry`] /
//! `EventualRef` resolution shape from `dregg_turn` (the cascading
//! resolve/broken-propagation machinery), rather than reinventing it. The queue
//! is modelled as the gateway's in-crate inbox (`VecDeque` of routed work) toward
//! the worker's executor cell; wiring it to the cross-crate captp `MerkleQueue` +
//! real `CustodyReceipt` (so the route can cross a federation / a relay) is the
//! next slice — the ENQUEUE → EXECUTE → RESULTS-BACK shape here is real and
//! tested, not a synchronous rename.
