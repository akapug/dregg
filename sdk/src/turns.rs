//! # The authorized turn builder — the SDK's one public turn shape.
//!
//! ```text
//! Identity → .turn() → typed verb builders → .sign() → .submit() → Receipt
//! ```
//!
//! [`AgentRuntime::turn()`](crate::AgentRuntime::turn) opens a
//! [`TurnBuilder`]; the typed verbs ([`transfer`](TurnBuilder::transfer),
//! [`write`](TurnBuilder::write), [`grant`](TurnBuilder::grant), …, or a
//! [`factories`](crate::factories)/[`polis`](crate::polis) plan via
//! [`effects`](TurnBuilder::effects)) accumulate the act;
//! [`sign()`](TurnBuilder::sign) binds it to the identity's Ed25519 key over
//! the canonical signing message (federation-bound, replay-separated); and
//! [`submit()`](AuthorizedTurn::submit) executes it and returns the
//! [`Receipt`] noun.
//!
//! **An unauthorized act is inexpressible here.** There is no method on this
//! surface that yields an unsigned action — by the time anything reaches the
//! executor it carries a real `Authorization::Signature`. The raw vocabulary
//! (including the genesis-only `Authorization::Unchecked`) lives behind the
//! sealed [`raw`](crate::raw) module.
//!
//! The anti-blind-signing affordance rides along:
//! [`AuthorizedTurn::explain()`] renders the clerk's faithful, total
//! explanation of exactly what was signed.
