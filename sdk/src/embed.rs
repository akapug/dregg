//! # dregg-embed: No-I/O integration layer
//!
//! This module provides a zero-I/O facade over dregg's core capabilities,
//! suitable for embedding in any existing service without dragging in dregg's
//! networking, consensus, or storage infrastructure.
//!
//! The pattern follows the "sans-io" approach: all methods are synchronous,
//! take bytes in, and produce bytes/state-transitions out. The **caller**
//! handles transport, persistence, and scheduling.
//!
//! # What's no-IO here
//!
//! - `TurnExecutor::execute()` — pure state machine, no I/O
//! - `prove_presentation` / `verify_presentation` — pure computation
//! - Token mint/attenuate — pure HMAC/hash operations
//! - `WireCodec::encode` / `decode` — pure serialization
//!
//! # Integration examples
//!
//! ## Axum HTTP handler (verify proof from a header)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // IGNORED: axum is deliberately NOT a dependency of `dregg-sdk` — an embedder brings their
//! // own framework, which is the whole premise of this module — so `HeaderMap`, `State` and
//! // `StatusCode` cannot resolve here. Only the framework half is unchecked: every `engine.`
//! // call below is the real signature, and the two examples under this one compile and run.
//! use base64::{Engine as _, engine::general_purpose::STANDARD as BASE64};
//!
//! async fn verify_handler(headers: HeaderMap, State(engine): State<Arc<DreggEngine>>) -> StatusCode {
//!     let Some(proof_b64) = headers.get("x-dregg-proof") else {
//!         return StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST;
//!     };
//!     let Ok(proof_bytes) = BASE64.decode(proof_b64.as_bytes()) else {
//!         return StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST;
//!     };
//!     // Checks the STARK, the federation-root binding, the (action, resource) binding and
//!     // freshness — against the engine's OWN root, so there is no root argument to get wrong.
//!     // `Ok(false)` is "did not verify"; `Err` is "did not decode".
//!     match engine.verify_presentation_bytes(&proof_bytes, "read", "api/v1/users") {
//!         Ok(true) => StatusCode::OK,
//!         Ok(false) => StatusCode::FORBIDDEN,
//!         Err(_) => StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## gRPC interceptor (attenuate token per-request)
//!
//! ```
//! use dregg_sdk::embed::{DreggEngine, EngineConfig};
//! use dregg_token::Attenuation;
//!
//! // One request in: hand the callee a token that can do strictly less than the parent.
//! // Attenuation only ever narrows, so this is safe to do per request without re-minting.
//! fn intercept(
//!     engine: &DreggEngine,
//!     parent_token: &str,
//!     root_key: &[u8; 32],
//!     restrictions: &Attenuation,
//! ) -> String {
//!     engine
//!         .attenuate_token(parent_token, root_key, restrictions)
//!         .expect("the parent token decodes under the root key it was minted with")
//! }
//!
//! let engine = DreggEngine::new(EngineConfig::for_testing());
//! let root_key = b"test-root-key-32-bytes-exactly!!";
//! let parent = engine.mint_token(root_key, "compute").unwrap();
//!
//! let this_request = Attenuation {
//!     services: vec![("compute".into(), "r".into())],
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! let narrowed = intercept(&engine, &parent, root_key, &this_request);
//! assert_ne!(narrowed, parent);
//! ```
//!
//! ## CLI tool (generate proof, output bytes)
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // NO_RUN: writes `proof.bin` into the process's working directory.
//! use dregg_sdk::embed::{DreggEngine, EngineConfig};
//! use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};
//!
//! // A REAL wall-clock timestamp: `prove_presentation` refuses to sign at 0 rather than emit a
//! // proof every verifier holding real time would reject as "from the future".
//! let now = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs() as i64;
//! let engine = DreggEngine::new(EngineConfig::new(now));
//!
//! let root_key = b"my-root-key-32-bytes-exactly!!!!";
//! let token = engine.mint_token(root_key, "my-service").unwrap();
//! // (encoded token, the root key it was minted under, the attenuations applied since — none
//! // here — and the (action, resource) the proof is BOUND to).
//! let proof = engine
//!     .prove_presentation(&token, root_key, &[], "read", "my-service")
//!     .unwrap();
//! std::fs::write("proof.bin", &proof).unwrap();
//! ```
