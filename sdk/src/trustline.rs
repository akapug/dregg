//! # Trustline — the bilateral line of credit as an SDK noun
//! (.docs-history-noclaude/ORGANS.md §1, .docs-history-noclaude/TRUSTLINES.md; Lean twin
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Apps/Trustline.lean`).
//!
//! "Issuer A extends holder B a line of N" is an ATTENUATED CAPABILITY whose
//! exercise debits a shared counter — the granted ⊆ held relation made
//! QUANTITATIVE (`holder_credit_le_line_forever`). This module is the
//! embedded-runtime face of that primitive, riding the owner runtime's
//! normal `.turn()` path exactly like [`crate::factories`] settlement deals
//! (no new executor entry):
//!
//! * **The cell** is born from the per-line content-addressed
//!   [`trustline_factory_descriptor`] (`dregg_cell::blueprint`), whose
//!   installed program the executor re-evaluates on EVERY turn touching the
//!   cell: `drawn ≤ ceiling` for life (`trustline_within_line_forever`),
//!   terms pinned (`ceiling_immutable_forever`), settlement monotone and
//!   never beyond drawn.
//! * **The escrow** (fullReserve backing): [`Trustline::open`] moves the
//!   full line `N` from the issuer's cell into the trustline cell's own
//!   balance — an ordinary conserving `Transfer`, never a mint. Combined
//!   with the `drawn ≤ ceiling` tooth, every settlement payout is solvent
//!   by construction.
//! * **The capability**: at open, the cell grants the HOLDER (and the
//!   operator) a c-list capability over itself — the line IS the
//!   capability; adoption is attenuation.
//! * **Draw / repay** move the shared `drawn` counter (the Stingray
//!   `BudgetSlice` face — `draw_slice_tracks_tryDebit`): draws are
//!   digest-identified and one-shot (`no_double_draw_forever`); repayment
//!   restores the line but never resurrects a digest
//!   (`draw_repay_roundtrip`, `repay_draws_fixed`).
//! * **Settle** redeems the outstanding drawn amount as an ordinary
//!   `Transfer` from the escrow to the holder (the `(agent, total_spent)`
//!   settlement-list shape of `rebalance_budgets`, applied as a move —
//!   `settlePay_conserves_hard`).
//!
//! The NODE-side twin (`node/src/trustline_service.rs`) drives the same
//! cell shape against the live ledger AND welds the Stingray
//! `StingrayCounter` coordinator to it (`init_budget_coordinator` at birth,
//! `collect_spending_certificates`/`rebalance_budgets` at settle). The SDK
//! face has no coordinator: the executor-installed cell program is the
//! enforcement tooth, and the per-digest anti-replay registry is carried by
//! the [`Trustline`] handle (a divergence from the Lean model's
//! forever-registry only across handle loss; the node face closes it with a
//! service-held registry).
