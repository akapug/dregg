//! # Settlement-factory builders — the dregg3 SDK surface for escrow /
//! obligation / bridge-cell deals over SURVIVING verbs only.
//!
//! Per `metatheory/Dregg2/Substrate/VerbRegistry.lean`, the kernel verb
//! families `CreateEscrow/ReleaseEscrow/RefundEscrow` (+ the `Committed`
//! trio), `CreateObligation/FulfillObligation/SlashObligation`, and
//! `BridgeLock/BridgeFinalize/BridgeCancel` are classified `factory`: their
//! arms dissolve, and their behavior re-lands as factory-born cells whose
//! [`dregg_cell::blueprint`] programs enforce the same safety. **No builder in
//! this module constructs any of those doomed variants.** Every turn here is
//! made of exactly four surviving verbs:
//!
//! * [`Effect::CreateCellFromFactory`] — birth the per-deal settlement cell,
//! * [`Effect::SetField`] — write the deal terms / drive the state machine,
//! * [`Effect::Transfer`] — move the locked value (the value lives in the
//!   settlement cell's own `balance`; NO side-table),
//! * [`Effect::GrantCapability`] — the one-time adopt self-grant that gives
//!   the operator driving reach over the born cell (survivor verb `.grant`).
//!
//! The safety is NOT in these builders: it is in the [`CellProgram`] the
//! factory installs on the cell, which the executor re-evaluates on EVERY
//! turn that touches it (`turn/src/executor/execute_tree.rs`). A caller who
//! bypasses this module and hand-writes a turn against a settlement cell
//! faces the same program gate. What the builders add is the ONE sensible
//! turn shape for each step (in particular: the payout `Transfer` targets the
//! counterparty PUBLISHED in the deal terms, and moves the published amount).
//!
//! ## Lean provenance (the proved spec each family mirrors)
//!
//! | family     | Lean module                      | keystones                                              |
//! |------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
//! | escrow     | `Dregg2.Apps.EscrowFactory`      | `no_double_resolve`, `release_requires_condition`, `release_conserves`/`refund_conserves`, `open_releasable`/`open_refundable` |
//! | obligation | `Dregg2.Apps.ObligationFactory`  | `no_double_resolve_{fulfilled,slashed}`, `fulfil_requires_condition`, `slash_requires_deadline`, `slash_rejects_when_condition_met` |
//! | bridge     | `Dregg2.Apps.BridgeCell`         | `no_double_finalize`, `no_refinalize_after_cancel`, `finalize_requires_finality_witness`, `locked_cancellable` |
//!
//! ## Deal lifecycle (all three families)
//!
//! 1. **Plan** — `create_*_cell(..)` builds a [`SettlementCellPlan`]: the
//!    per-deal content-addressed [`FactoryDescriptor`] plus four turns.
//! 2. **Deploy** — register `plan.descriptor` with the executor
//!    (`AgentRuntime::deploy_factory`).
//! 3. **Create** — the creator executes `plan.create_effects` (one
//!    `CreateCellFromFactory`, an ordinary agent turn). The cell is born
//!    all-zero with the deal's program installed for life, owned by
//!    `owner_pubkey`.
//! 4. **Fund** — the funder executes `plan.fund_effects`: one `Transfer` of
//!    `value + ADOPT_TURN_FEE` into the cell ([`ADOPT_TURN_FEE`] is the fee
//!    the adopt turn burns; exactly `value` remains for settlement).
//! 5. **Adopt** — the OWNER runs `plan.adopt_effects` as a cell-agent turn
//!    (`AgentRuntime::execute_as(plan.cell_id, .., ADOPT_TURN_FEE)`): the
//!    cell self-grants the operator a c-list capability on itself. This is
//!    the in-band, effect-level form of the node's seed-time operator grant.
//! 6. **Open** — the operator executes `plan.open_effects` via
//!    `AgentRuntime::execute_on(plan.cell_id, ..)`: the deal terms are
//!    written and the state steps to OPEN (`SetField`×6). From this turn on,
//!    every term slot is pinned to the descriptor's published literal — the
//!    program rejects any rewrite.
//! 7. **Resolve** — exactly one of the two resolve builders commits (again
//!    via `execute_on`); the program then makes the cell terminally inert
//!    (no-double-resolve).
//!
//! ## Who drives the cell (authority model)
//!
//! A settlement cell is driven by turns whose ACTION TARGETS the cell,
//! signed by its `owner_pubkey` (the executor verifies the Ed25519 signature
//! against the target cell's own key) and reached through the operator's
//! c-list capability (the parent gate). The operator's agent cell is the
//! turn agent and pays the fees. This is the same shape the node's ingress
//! uses for factory-born app cells. Authority to ATTEMPT a transition is the
//! owner key + the capability; whether the transition COMMITS is decided
//! solely by the installed program (a depositor who owns the escrow cell
//! still cannot release without the condition witness — the program, not the
//! signature, is the safety gate).
