//! # `Receipt` — the first of the SDK's two user-facing nouns.
//!
//! A [`Receipt`] is dregg's canonical proof-of-execution artifact: the
//! committed turn's hashes (turn / forest / effects), the pre/post state
//! roots, the agent cell, the federation binding, and the receipt-chain
//! link `previous_receipt_hash`. Every authorized submission
//! ([`AuthorizedTurn::submit`](crate::turns::AuthorizedTurn::submit))
//! returns one.
//!
//! The proof is **lazily attached**: a `Receipt` is born proofless (the
//! commit decision is the executor's; the STARK is additive attestation)
//! and a [`TurnProof`] — the composed full-turn STARK — can be attached
//! when a prover produces one (the node's async prove pool, a local
//! [`prove_full_turn`](crate::full_turn_proof::prove_full_turn) run, or a
//! fetched artifact). [`Receipt::proof()`] reads it; the internal proof
//! plumbing (`ComposedProof`, sub-proof components, PI layouts) stays off
//! the public surface.
//!
//! The second noun is [`AttestedHistory`](dregg_lightclient::AttestedHistory)
//! — the light-client artifact: the verdict obtained by verifying ONE
//! succinct whole-history aggregate. A `Receipt` says "this turn committed,
//! here is its place in a chain"; an `AttestedHistory` says "every turn of
//! this whole history executed correctly" — and between them that is the
//! entire user-facing proof story.
