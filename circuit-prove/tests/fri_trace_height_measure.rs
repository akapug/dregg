//! # THE DEPLOYED TRACE-HEIGHT MEASUREMENT — the input `ε_C` needs and nobody had measured.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! `docs/reference/FRI-SOUNDNESS-FRONTIER-RESEARCH.md` §3.2 names one number as *"the single input
//! that moves the proven posture most and nobody has measured it"*: the **deployed trace height**.
//! The reason is BCIKS20's commit-phase error, read verbatim from the paper
//! (`~/dev/gh/forks/IACR-eprint-mirror/2020/654.pdf`, Lemma 8.2 p.40 / Thm 8.3 pp.40-41):
//!
//! ```text
//! ε_FRI = ε_C + α^s ,   α = √ρ·(1 + 1/2m) ,   m ≥ 3
//! ε_C   = (m+½)⁷·|D⁽⁰⁾|² / (2ρ^{3/2}|F|)  +  (2m+1)(|D⁽⁰⁾|+1)·Σᵢ l⁽ⁱ⁾ / (√ρ·|F|)
//! ```
//!
//! **`ε_C ∝ |D⁽⁰⁾|²`.** So the proven posture is NOT trace-invariant — it falls ~2 bits per trace
//! doubling. The shipped ledger (`fri_params_soundness_budget.rs`, `q·lb/2 + pow`) is the `m → ∞`
//! idealisation of the QUERY column ONLY: it drops ε_C entirely and therefore reports the same
//! number at every trace height. **`FriKnobs` carries no height field at all.** That is the gap this
//! file measures into.
//!
//! ## What this file does, and the one thing it deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It MEASURES. It runs real deployed workloads, reads `BatchProof::degree_bits` **off the proofs
//! they actually produce**, and pins the envelope. It computes **no soundness bound** — the
//! predecessor twin that re-derived that arithmetic in hand-written Rust is exactly what
//! `fri_params_soundness_budget.rs` exists to have deleted, and this file does not resurrect it.
//! `ε_C` is being mechanized as a real column in `Dregg2.Circuit.FriLedger` (a sibling lane); this
//! file supplies the **`|D⁽⁰⁾|` that column consumes**, measured rather than assumed.
//!
//! The research report is explicit that its own `|D⁽⁰⁾|` was **assumed, not measured** (2^12 from the
//! `degree_bits [6,3,4]` fixture; 2^20 as a hypothetical tall anchor). Both are now measured, and
//! **both were wrong in the same direction** — see the findings.
//!
//! ## `|D⁽⁰⁾| = height · 2^log_blowup` — CONFIRMED IN THE DEPLOYED CODE, not assumed
//!
//! Traced through the pinned plonky3 (`Cargo.toml:238`, rev `82cfad73`):
//!   * `uni-stark/src/prover.rs:43-44` — `let degree = trace.height(); log2_strict_usize(degree)`
//!     (a non-power-of-two trace PANICS — heights are exactly powers of two);
//!   * `fri/src/two_adic_pcs.rs:285` — `natural_domain_for_degree` ⇒ the trace domain `H` has
//!     `|H| = height` exactly;
//!   * `fri/src/two_adic_pcs.rs:314-318` — commit does `coset_lde_batch(evals, log_blowup, shift)`;
//!   * `dft/src/traits.rs:253-261` — the LDE is literally a left-shift by `log_blowup`;
//!   * the read side inverts it: `two_adic_pcs.rs:380` `lde.height() >> self.fri.log_blowup`.
//! BCIKS20 defines `ρ = (k⁽⁰⁾+1)/|D⁽⁰⁾|` (Lemma 8.2), and ethSTARK's own worked example
//! (eprint 2021/582 §5.10.2: `|H₀| = 2^20`, `ρ = 1/4`, `|D| = 2^22`) is the same relation.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE FINDINGS — three, and each contradicts an assumption the report had to make
//!
//! **1. The tall trace is not hypothetical. It is DEPLOYED, on every fold, by construction.**
//! `accumulator.rs:238` sets `WRAP_LOG_CEIL = 16` and `wrap_params()` applies it as a
//! `min_trace_height` FLOOR (live, and ON BY DEFAULT — `accumulator.rs:660`, `:427`), forcing every
//! running-proof table to `degree_bits ≥ 16` so the FRI phase count cannot grow with fold depth. That
//! knob — added to make the VK depth-invariant — is also the system's **tallest committed trace**,
//! and at `log_blowup = 3` it lands `|D⁽⁰⁾| = 2^19`. Measured natural fold heights are
//! `degree_bits [9, 9, 15, 14, 15]` (`apex_shrink_trace_anatomy`, re-measured for this file;
//! independently recorded at `accumulator.rs:227`) — so the ceiling pads 2^15 → 2^16. **The worst
//! case is also the typical case: no workload is small enough to escape it.**
//!
//! **2. The leaf height is NOT the effect-VM trace height — it is the CHIP table, and it overtakes.**
//! `MIN_TRACE_HEIGHT = 64` (`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs:508`) floors the MAIN table at 2^6, which
//! is where the report's `[6,3,4]` fixture comes from. But the deployed IR-v2 batch commits five
//! tables and FRI batches them onto the LARGEST domain. The Poseidon2 CHIP table is sized ~4 rows per
//! transfer (`descriptor_ir2.rs:3874`, `next_pow2`), so it **passes the main table at 32 effects**.
//! Measured, one deployed `transferVmDescriptor2` per row:
//!
//! | effects | trace rows | `degree_bits` | max | `\|D⁽⁰⁾\|` |
//! |---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
//! | 1 | 64 | `[6, 3, 4]` | 2^6 | 2^12 |
//! | 16 | 64 | `[6, 6, 4]` | 2^6 | 2^12 |
//! | 32 | 64 | `[6, 7, 4]` | **2^7** | 2^13 |
//! | 64 | 64 | `[6, 8, 4]` | **2^8** | 2^14 |
//! | 128 | 128 | `[7, 9, 4]` | 2^9 | 2^15 |
//! | 512 | 512 | `[9, 11, 4]` | 2^11 | 2^17 |
//!
//! A gate reading the effect-VM trace height would report 2^6 for the 32-effect turn and be wrong by
//! a factor of 2 in `|D⁽⁰⁾|` — i.e. by ~2 proven bits. **Height must be read off the PROOF, which is
//! why this file reads `BatchProof::degree_bits` and never the witness.**
//!
//! **3. Nothing caps effects-per-turn**, so the leaf `|D⁽⁰⁾|` is UNBOUNDED ABOVE (a census of
//! `turn/`, `intent/`, `circuit/src/effect_vm/` found no `MAX_EFFECTS`-class bound). The leaf is
//! small in practice — a real multi-verb turn through the production `TurnExecutor` measures
//! `degree_bits [3,4,3,3]` (`circuit/tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`), i.e. `2^4` — but there is
//! no structural reason it stays there, and every doubling costs ~2 proven bits. That is a real
//! open residual, named here rather than papered over: the envelope below is pinned at a MEASURED
//! turn size, not at a proven bound.
//!
//! ⚑ `create_recursion_config` was ALREADY the named weakest link on the query column (pow 14 ⇒
//! Johnson 71, `fri_params_soundness_budget.rs:906`). It is ALSO the tallest-trace config. The two
//! weaknesses compound on the same object, and the query ledger cannot see the second one.
//!
//! ## What this file asserts
//!
//! The ENVELOPE, not a bound: every measured deployed height stays inside a pinned window, and the
//! recursion ceiling is that window's top. A regression that makes a trace TALLER reds this file —
//! which is the point, because a taller trace silently lowers the proven number and NO existing gate
//! can see it (`FriKnobs` has no height field, so the ledger reports the same bits either way).
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --release --test fri_trace_height_measure -- --nocapture`
