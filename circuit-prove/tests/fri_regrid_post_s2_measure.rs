//! # E4 — THE FRI RE-GRID MEASUREMENT at post-S2 / mocked-floor widths (PRE-FREEZE)
//!
//! `ir2_config`'s `(log_blowup 6, 19 queries, pow 16)` point was tuned when the member proof was
//! 120.4 KiB. Post-S2 it is 375 KB (main 1704×64, chip 386×256, range 16; 394,400 committed
//! cells — `docs/MEASURE-legacy-1felt-chain-drop.md`), and the Epoch-2 floor (~82.8K cells) moves
//! the knee again: at floor scale the lb-8 LDE volume ≈ today's lb-6 volume (21.2M vs 25.2M
//! cell-evals). This harness is the measurement lane `docs/EFFICIENCY-BACKLOG-circuit-minimality.md`
//! §E4 calls for, run BYTE-SAFE:
//!
//!   * **NO regen, no FS re-pin, no descriptor bytes.** Nothing here mints from any registry —
//!     the traces are MOCKED synthetic-width fixtures (see below). The `(lb,q)` flip itself is a
//!     regen (FS epoch) and is STAGED for the Epoch-2 bundle, not performed here.
//!   * **Every candidate goes through the actual Lean `dregg_fri_ledger`** — the commit-phase
//!     `ε_C` column depends on the trace height and BINDS BELOW the Johnson closed-form at the
//!     deployed wrap, so the two closed-form query columns alone cannot judge a `log_blowup`
//!     move. The verdicts here are the compiled `Dregg2.Circuit.FriLedger.friLedger`'s numbers,
//!     not a Rust re-derivation (there is deliberately no soundness formula in this file).
//!   * The candidate set is the backlog's: `(8,15,16)`, `(8,14,16)` vs the deployed `(6,19,16)`,
//!     PLUS the two never-gridded knobs — `commit_proof_of_work_bits > 0` (hardwired 0 in every
//!     shipped config; unpriced by the ledger — a NAMED residual, `FriLedger.lean`) and
//!     `log_final_poly_len > 0` (echoed on the ledger wire, enters no soundness column).
//!
//! ## The MOCKED shapes (and what each is honest about)
//!
//! ⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD: the synthetic descriptors below are MEASUREMENT FIXTURES — cost
//! geometry only, all-zero traces under degree-2 always-satisfied gates. They are NOT authored
//! AIR, ship nowhere, and bind nothing; the deployed AIR stays Lean-authored and untouched.
//!
//!   * **A. post-S2 member main proxy** — W=1704 at h=2^6: the measured post-S2 main table. Its
//!     per-candidate BYTE ratios carry the per-query × width structure of the real member; its
//!     absolute bytes UNDERSTATE the member (no chip/range instances, no permutation columns).
//!   * **B. Epoch-2 floor cell-proxy** — W=1293 at h=2^6 = the ~82.8K-cell floor as one
//!     instance; its lb-8 LDE volume (2^14 × 1293 ≈ 21.2M) is exactly the backlog's arithmetic.
//!   * **C. post-S2 total-cell proxy** — W=6162 at h=2^6 = all 394,400 post-S2 cells as one
//!     instance: the PROVER-COST equivalent of today's whole member (its LDE volume at each lb
//!     matches the real member's total). Its bytes OVERSTATE (the chip's cells ride at 2^8 in
//!     production, not as width); read prover time here, bytes from A.
//!
//! Prover-cost caveat, stated not smuggled: shape A misses the chip instance's own 4× LDE at
//! lb 8 (386×2^8 → 2^16 domain); shape C prices it back in as width. The two bracket the truth.
//!
//! Run the ledger gate (fast, always on):
//!   CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/adv-E4 cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --release \
//!     --test fri_regrid_post_s2_measure -- --nocapture
//! Run the byte/time sweep (SLOW, 21 proves):
//!   CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/adv-E4 cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --release \
