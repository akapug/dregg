//! # THE MEMBERSHIP-BINDING FOLD-MECHANISM TOOTH.
//!
//! The membership analog of the in-lib custom fold-wire teeth and `bridge_binding_mechanism`: it
//! exercises the membership-binding MECHANISM end-to-end over REAL recursion leaves, WITHOUT the
//! deployed `SenderAuthorized` leg's tuple-emit (the named big-bang piece). Two
//! `prove_membership_leaf_with_claim` leaves — each a genuine membership leaf re-exposing its bound
//! 2-slot `(sender_leaf, authorized_root)` tuple as an `expose_claim` — are folded through
//! `prove_membership_binding_node`, which `connect`s the two tuples lane-by-lane.
//!
//! * HONEST (in-set) — both leaves bind the SAME `(sender_leaf, authorized_root)`: the per-lane
//!   `connect` is consistent, the node folds, the bound tuple is re-exposed. A pure light client
//!   folding it now WITNESSES the sender's set-membership tuple.
//! * FORGED (out-of-set) — the "leg" leaf claims a DIFFERENT `(sender_leaf, authorized_root)` than
//!   the bound membership leaf: the per-lane `connect` is a conflict ⇒ the aggregation is UNSAT ⇒ no
//!   node proof. This is the bite that makes the membership REAL for a pure light client: a leg
//!   cannot claim a membership tuple no verifying membership leaf backs.
//!
//! The deployed wiring (a DUAL-EXPOSE `SenderAuthorized` leg leaf, segment ++ the `(leaf, root)`
//! tuple at fixed PI slots, folded via `prove_membership_binding_node_segmented`) is READY but gated
//! on the `SenderAuthorized` descriptor EMITTING the tuple PIs (today the effect-vm "membership"
//! column is the unrelated `cap_root`); that descriptor-emit rides the big-bang VK regen. This tooth
//! proves the fold MECHANISM + the membership leaf are correct today.
//!
//! Real recursion (minutes), so both poles are `#[ignore]`. Run with:
//!   cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test membership_binding_mechanism -- --ignored --nocapture
