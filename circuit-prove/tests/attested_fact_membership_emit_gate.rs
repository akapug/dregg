//! Byte-pin and real-prover gate for the Lean-emitted **attested-fact-membership** descriptor —
//! the third-party rung of the predicate stack.
//!
//! Constraint authorship lives only in
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/AttestedFactMembershipEmit.lean`. This test pins Lean's exact
//! bytes, parses and dispatches that artifact, proves the production chip-lane witness through the
//! REAL p3 prover, verifies it, and drives forged fixtures to rejection — one per tooth.
//!
//! ## What the teeth are for
//!
//! The descriptor exists so a THIRD PARTY can verify a predicate proof without knowing the value.
//! It proves, at `pi = [fact_commitment, facts_root, state_root]`, that `fact_commitment` is the
//! blinded image of a `fact_hash` that is a MEMBER of `facts_root`. Every mutation below is a way a
//! prover might try to publish a commitment of its OWN choosing under someone else's root — which
//! is exactly the forgery the rung exists to refuse.
