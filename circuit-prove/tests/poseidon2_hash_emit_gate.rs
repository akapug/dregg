//! # The emit-from-Lean EQUALITY GATE — the RAW Poseidon2 hash (arity-2 preimage → digest).
//!
//! The standalone-hash face of the deprecated hand AIR `Poseidon2Air`
//! (`circuit/src/poseidon2_air.rs::Poseidon2Air`): a public digest is the Poseidon2 hash of a public
//! preimage. Where `merkle_membership_emit_gate.rs` keeps the preimage PRIVATE and pins only the
//! root, this gate exposes BOTH the preimage and the digest as public inputs — the
//! `Poseidon2Air.boundary_constraints` shape (`poseidon2_air.rs:135-148`, row-0 input cols pinned to
//! the input PIs, output cols to the output PIs) — over ONE arity-2 `Poseidon2Chip` lookup (the
//! `Poseidon2Air.eval_constraints` native permutation, `poseidon2_air.rs:114-120`).
//!
//! The descriptor is AUTHORED in Lean (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/Poseidon2HashEmit.lean`,
//! `poseidon2HashDesc`) and its wire string is byte-pinned there (`emitVmJson2` `#guard`). This test
//! includes that EXACT committed artifact and:
//!
//!   1. DECODES it via [`parse_vm_descriptor2`] and checks the emitted shape without constructing
//!      any Rust constraint;
//!   2. KATs the arity-2 chip mapping: `chip_absorb_all_lanes(2, [a,b])[0] == hash_2_to_1(a,b)`
//!      (the `Poseidon2Air` permutation IS the chip's arity-2 absorb — same rate-4 seeding);
//!   3. proves an HONEST hash witness (real preimage + genuine `hash_2_to_1` digest) through
//!      [`prove_vm_descriptor2`], asserts ACCEPT, and re-verifies the proof against the public PIs;
//!   4. the MUTATION CANARY — four tampers, each isolating ONE emitted constraint:
//!        (a) a FORGED digest column (pin kept satisfiable) → the chip lookup names an unserved row;
//!        (b) a TAMPERED preimage keeping the claimed digest → the chip lookup (new preimage does not
//!            hash to the old digest) is UNSAT (the preimage-binding tooth);
//!        (c) a FORGED digest PI (honest trace) → the digest boundary pin is UNSAT;
//!        (d) a FORGED preimage PI (honest trace) → the preimage boundary pin is UNSAT.
//!
//! Each canary is NON-VACUOUS by construction: the honest witness is asserted to prove+verify first,
//! and the value that changes is guarded by EXACTLY the one constraint the canary names.
