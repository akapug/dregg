//! # THE DEPLOYED CUSTOM-BINDING LIGHT-CLIENT TOOTH.
//!
//! This is the integration tooth for the deployed custom-effect fold-wire (the close of the one
//! REAL deployed light-client vacuity). It builds a REAL 2-turn chain whose FIRST turn is an
//! `Effect::Custom` turn carrying a `customVmDescriptor2R24` wide leg (publishing its claimed
//! 8-felt `custom_proof_commitment` at IR2 PI 46..53 — the proof-bind flag-day rotation) PLUS the prover-side `CustomWitnessBundle` (the
//! re-provable `CellProgram` + trace witness + PIs), folds it through the DEPLOYED chain prover
//! (`prove_turn_chain_recursive` → `prove_chain_core_rotated`), and verifies the whole-chain
//! artifact through the light-client verifier (`verify_turn_chain_recursive`).
//!
//! The deployed wire mints, for the custom turn, a DUAL-EXPOSE leaf (segment ++ the claimed
//! commitment, `ivc_turn_chain::prove_descriptor_leaf_dual_expose`) and folds it against the
//! RE-PROVEN custom sub-proof leaf under a binding node. **Since the state-binding flip the
//! deployed pair is `custom_leaf_adapter::prove_custom_leaf_with_state_commitment` (the 24-lane
//! claim) under `joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_state_segmented`** — which welds
//! TWO things inside the recursion tree a pure light client folds:
//!
//!   1. the leg's CLAIMED commitment == the sub-proof's GENUINE in-circuit commitment, and
//!   2. the sub-proof's DECLARED `[old8 ‖ new8]` == the leg's REAL rotated roots.
//!
//! THE POLES:
//!   * HONEST — the sub-proof declares the leg's real roots and the leg claims the genuine
//!     commitment: the chain folds and the light client ACCEPTS.
//!   * FORGED COMMITMENT — the leg claims a commitment NO verifying sub-proof of the bundle's PIs
//!     backs: the commitment `connect` conflicts ⇒ UNSAT ⇒ no root ⇒ REJECTED.
//!   * FORGED ROOT (the flip's headline) — the sub-proof VERIFIES and its commitment is honest,
//!     but it is about a DIFFERENT transition: the state `connect` conflicts ⇒ UNSAT ⇒ REJECTED.
//!     Before the flip this folded and the light client accepted it; `canary__*` proves that by
//!     folding the same forgery through the pre-flip pair.
//!   * NON-ABI PROGRAM — a sub-program too narrow to express the prefix is refused fail-closed
//!     (the deployed executor already refused it; the prover now agrees).
//!
//! This makes the premise of Lean `CustomBindingFromFold.custom_binding_from_fold` TRUE on the
//! DEPLOYED path, and closes the `custom_state_binding` "tooth 2" remainder. The folds are real
//! recursions (minutes), so those poles are `#[ignore]`. Run with:
//!   cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test custom_binding_deployed_tooth -- --ignored --nocapture
