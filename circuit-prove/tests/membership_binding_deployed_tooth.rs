//! # THE DEPLOYED MEMBERSHIP-BINDING LIGHT-CLIENT TOOTH (the membership twin of
//! `custom_binding_deployed_tooth.rs`).
//!
//! Builds a REAL 2-turn chain whose FIRST turn is a sender-authorized `Transfer` turn carrying
//! the v12 membership-edge wide leg — the `(sender_leaf, authorized_root)` teeth PUBLISHED at
//! the tail claim PIs (`MEMBERSHIP_CLAIM_PI_LO` = 50..51, post-rc-wrap, on the caveat-carrying transfer
//! family) — PLUS the prover-side `MembershipWitnessBundle` (the re-provable membership
//! tuple), folds it through the DEPLOYED chain prover's Membership arm, and verifies through
//! the light-client verifier.
//!
//! ## NATIVE (the big-bang regen LANDED — exposure leg)
//!
//! The committed wide registry row IS the deployed membership-teeth member
//! (`CarrierComposed.transferV3MembershipWide`): the two teeth columns at the wide end
//! (1771..1772) row-0-pinned at the claim PIs 50..51 (Lean keystone
//! `transferV3MembershipWide_publishes_teeth`). This tooth proves the NATIVE row. HONEST SCOPE
//! (`CarrierComposed` §5): the row carries the PI-EXPOSURE leg ONLY — what THIS tooth witnesses
//! is the FOLD edge (leg-claimed tuple == re-proven membership leaf, in the recursion tree a
//! pure light client folds); the in-AIR compress/fields-read welds stay the named
//! `MembershipAuthRootEdge` seams (the executor `node8` re-align `687601953` + the ROOT leg
//! `346629d0c` are built, the deployed weld is not composed — `SenderAuthorized` is OPTIONAL on
//! a transfer), and `MembershipBackingAttack` §A/§A′ stand as deployed-AIR facts.
//!
//! THE TWO POLES: honest tuple == bundle folds + verifies; a forged bundle (a root no leg
//! teeth back — the `MembershipBackingAttack.§A'` injected-root shape, inverted onto the fold)
//! ⇒ in-circuit `connect` conflict ⇒ UNSAT ⇒ REJECTED.
//!
//! Both poles are `#[ignore]` (real recursion, minutes). Run with:
//!   cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test membership_binding_deployed_tooth -- --ignored --nocapture
