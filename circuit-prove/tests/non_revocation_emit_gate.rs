//! # The emit-from-Lean EQUALITY GATE — sorted-tree NON-MEMBERSHIP (the `revocation` family).
//!
//! Validates that the non-revocation (freshness) statement the hand-written non-revocation AIR
//! (`circuit/src/dsl/revocation.rs::non_revocation_circuit_descriptor`) enforces is faithfully
//! EMITTED from Lean as an `EffectVmDescriptor2` and gates green through the REAL
//! `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2`.
//!
//! The descriptor is AUTHORED in Lean (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/NonRevocationEmit.lean`,
//! `nonRevocationDesc`) and its wire string is byte-pinned there (`emitVmJson2` `#guard`). This test
//! embeds that EXACT string ([`GOLDEN_JSON`]), and:
//!
//!   1. DECODES it via [`parse_vm_descriptor2`] and asserts the decode equals an independently
//!      hand-built `EffectVmDescriptor2` (Lean emit ≡ Rust builder — a byte drift on either side
//!      breaks this OR the Lean `#guard`);
//!   2. proves an HONEST freshness witness — an item `x` strictly bracketed by two ADJACENT
//!      committed sorted leaves `L < x < R`, both members of the public root — through
//!      [`prove_vm_descriptor2`], asserts ACCEPT, and re-verifies;
//!   3. the MUTATION CANARIES — each tamper forces a real UNSAT rejected BY A SPECIFIC CONSTRAINT:
//!      forged root PI (root pin), de-bracketed item (the 30-bit ORDERING RANGE — the non-membership
//!      tooth), non-adjacent neighbors (adjacency gate), forged bracketing leaf / forged sibling
//!      (Merkle-path membership pins), and a forged published queried item (the no-double-spend
//!      binding "b"). Each canary asserts the honest witness ACCEPTS first, so none is vacuous.
