//! # THE FRI PARAMS→BITS LEDGER GATE — Rust PINS the knobs; LEAN owns the numbers.
//!
//! ## What this file used to be, and why it is not that any more
//!
//! Its predecessor (`circuit/tests/fri_params_soundness_budget.rs`, DELETED) re-derived, in
//! hand-written Rust, the soundness arithmetic the metatheory already models in excruciating detail:
//! `fn conjectured_bits(lb, q, pow) = q*lb + pow`, `fn proven_bits(lb, q, pow) = q*lb/2 + pow`, and a
//! long prose header narrating a per-fold posture (~112.6 / ~109.84) that the Rust computed no part
//! of. That is a TWIN. It can drift from the model it claims to report, and — worse — a
//! re-computation is not a check at all: it agrees with itself by construction. The one load-bearing
//! thing it did was the PIN (deployed consts == the Lean literals), because a pin COMPARES AGAINST
//! the model rather than restating it.
//!
//! So: the pin is kept and sharpened; the re-derivation is gone. Every number below arrives from
//! `@[export] dregg_fri_ledger` — the compiled `Dregg2.Circuit.FriLedger.friLedger`, the same
//! function `Dregg2.Circuit.FriLedgerSound` proves about. There is no soundness formula in this file.
//!
//! ## What Lean exports, and what it cannot
//!
//! **A soundness bound is a `Prop`; a `Prop` cannot be exported.** What is exported is the COMPUTABLE
//! LEDGER — six `Nat` columns per config. The theorems are what justify them:
//!
//!   * `FriLedgerSound.ledger_perFold_soundness` — ONE PARAMETRIC theorem: at ANY config, a word whose
//!     phase map is injective has at most `goodCount` good folding challenges, of density
//!     `< 2^(-perFoldBits)` in the degree-`extDeg` extension. It instantiates
//!     `FriArityTransfer.good_card_le_of_phase_injective` at that config's arity `m = 2^maxLogArity`
//!     and folded domain `|κ| = 2^logBlowup`. Every config below is an INSTANCE of it.
//!   * `FriLedgerSound.wrap_perFold_soundness_from_ledger` — the deployed wrap's bound stated with the
//!     count and the exponent READ OFF the ledger rather than typed in, so the exported number cannot
//!     drift from the proved number: they are the same term.
//!   * `FriLedgerSound.{ledgerP_eq_babyBearP, chooseTwo_eq_choose_two, log2_eq_log_two}` — the pins
//!     that stop the import-thin exported definition from being a second model.
//!
//! ⚑ **THE `M = 1` FIBER BOUND IS NOW DISCHARGED AT EVERY SHIPPED CONFIG** (2026-07-15). Every
//! `per_fold_bits` is derived from `good_card_le_of_phase_injective`, which takes the fiber bound as
//! the HYPOTHESIS `hΦ` — correctly, since it is arity-generic and mentions no setup. `hΦ` was
//! discharged only at arity 2 / `logBlowup = 6` (§8's `far_fiber_card` + `wrap_fiber_le_one`) and
//! OPEN at the deployed arity 8 and at every `logBlowup = 3` config.
//!   `Dregg2.Circuit.FriArityFiberDischarge` builds the arity-`2^k` rate-`2^(−b)` RS setups
//!   PARAMETRICALLY (`friSetupK`: `|L| = 2^(k+b)`, `|κ| = 2^b`, dimension `2^k`), generalizes
//!   `far_fiber_card` to arity `n` (`far_fiber_card_arity`: `n·|Φ⁻¹(a)| + dOut < |L|`), and PROVES
//!   `hΦ` from farness at all six configs — four `(k, b)` instances of ONE theorem
//!   (`phase_injective_of_far`): the deployed arity-8 wrap at `dOut ≥ 496`
//!   (`arity8_phase_injective`), the rotated arity-2 wrap at `≥ 124`, the `logBlowup = 3` arity-2
//!   outer/recursion at `≥ 12`, the `logBlowup = 3` arity-8 v1/zk at `≥ 48`. Non-vacuous:
//!   `phase_injective_fires` exhibits a concrete far word at EVERY `(k, b)`.
//!   ⚠ Found on the way: the `Prop` that formerly NAMED the arity-8 obligation was **FALSE**, not
//!   open — it quantified over every phase map with no link to a far word, so the constant map
//!   refutes it (`FriArityTransfer.arity8FiberBoundNaive_false`). It had no consumers.
//! `#assert_axioms` is blind to hypotheses — the Lean being kernel-clean is NOT what makes these
//! numbers unconditional; the discharge theorems are.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE FINDINGS — 7 shipped configs, 7 different postures, 2 corrected claims
//!
//! The old gate judged **2 of 7** shipped FRI knob sets. It also collapsed: one `~112.6` headline was
//! narrated for the system. Reading every config through the same theorem says otherwise.
//!
//!   1. **The deployed IR-v2 wrap reads 109, not 112.** (`FriArityTransfer`'s result, now the
//!      ledger's own output.) `log₂ 7 ≈ 2.807` bits is the price of the arity-8 moment-curve fold.
//!   2. **"The gnark ETH-wrap runs arity-2, so ~112.6 is the right figure THERE" is FALSE.** It
//!      silently assumed the ETH wrap shares the wrap's `logBlowup = 6`. It does not — the outer
//!      shrink gnark verifies is `logBlowup = 3`, so `|κ| = 8`, `goodCount = 28`, and it reads
//!      **118** (`FriLedgerSound.ethWrap_is_not_the_112_config`). The sentence quoted a real number
//!      from the wrong object — exactly what a parametric ledger makes impossible.
//!   3. **The one shipped config ~112.6 actually describes** is `ir2_leaf_wrap_config()` (arity 2 at
//!      `logBlowup = 6`) — which, per the NAME COLLISION below, is *not* the config the Lean
//!      `ir2LeafWrapConfig` is named after.
//!   4. **`create_recursion_config` sits at capacity exactly 128** (`3·38 + 14`; its `14` query-PoW
//!      bits are unique among shipped configs) — the old gate's own drift margin, with zero headroom,
//!      on a config that gate never looked at.
//!   5. **`per_fold_bits` RISES as `logBlowup` FALLS** (118/116 at `logBlowup = 3` vs 112/109 at 6).
//!      Not a paradox and NOT an upgrade: it is the per-fold proximity-gap factor only — a smaller
//!      folded domain has fewer pairs, hence fewer good challenges. The rate is paid for in the QUERY
//!      ledger. The columns are reported separately and never multiplied into a headline; that
//!      independence is itself a theorem (`query_ledger_does_not_determine_perFold`).
//!
//! ⚑ **NAME COLLISION.** Lean's `FriVerifier.ir2LeafWrapConfig` (`maxLogArity = 3`) models the Rust
//! `dregg_circuit::descriptor_ir2::ir2_config`. The Rust fn actually *named*
//! `ivc_turn_chain::ir2_leaf_wrap_config()` is a DIFFERENT knob set (arity 1, via
//! `create_recursion_config_for_inner_fri`'s hardcoded PROBE). Two objects, one name, different
//! postures (109 vs 112). Modeled apart as `ir2LeafWrapConfig` / `ir2LeafWrapRotatedConfig`.
//!
//! ## Teeth
//!
//!   1. `every_shipped_config_reports_its_ledger_from_lean` — each of the 7 configs' numbers, FROM
//!      Lean, gated on its own floors. No config borrows another's number.
//!   2. `deployed_wrap_consts_equal_the_lean_modeled_config` + `deployed_consts_equal_their_lean_models`
//!      — THE PIN, kept and widened from 2 configs to 7, and from 5 knobs to 6 (`ext_deg`, which the
//!      old gate named as un-pinnable, is now an exported const and is pinned).
//!   3. `ledger_gate_reds_each_degraded_knob` — perturbs the DEPLOYED consts, one knob at a time, and
//!      requires the real gate to refuse with a typed reason NAMING that knob.
//!   4. `lean_model_pin_reds_wrap_drift_that_clears_both_floors` — the sharp one: a `logBlowup` 6→8
//!      move IMPROVES every numeric floor and still breaks the model. Only the pin sees it.
//!   5. `the_export_is_consulted_not_shadowed` — proves the numbers TRACK Lean rather than being a
//!      leftover Rust constant: it moves a knob and requires Lean's answer to move with it.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test fri_params_soundness_budget -- --nocapture`.
