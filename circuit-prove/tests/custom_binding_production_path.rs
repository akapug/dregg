//! # THE PRODUCTION-PATH CUSTOM-BINDING LIGHT-CLIENT TOOTH.
//!
//! The sibling of `custom_binding_deployed_tooth.rs`, but proving the binding over the
//! PRODUCTION-POPULATED fold rather than a hand-attached witness. Where the deployed tooth calls
//! `RotatedParticipantLeg::with_custom_witness` directly (a test-only setter), this builds the leg
//! through the PRODUCTION recipe:
//!
//!   1. the genuine `BoundCustomProof` is built RETAINING the re-provable trace witness,
//!      prover-side (the direct-construction form that survived stark-kill — the hand
//!      `prove_custom_program` STARK engine is deleted; the fold path RE-PROVES the leaf from the
//!      retained witness, so the off-AIR bytes are not load-bearing here);
//!   2. `CustomWitnessBundle::from_bound_custom_proof` projects that retained witness into the bundle
//!      (the RETENTION SEAM) — `None`-fail-closed if the proof came off the wire;
//!   3. `dregg_turn::rotation_witness::mint_custom_wide_rotated_participant_leg` drives `produce`
//!      over the real before/after `Cell`s and mints the `customVmDescriptor2R24` WIDE leg with the
//!      bundle ATTACHED — the production minter (not the test setter).
//!
//! The chain then folds through the SAME deployed prover (`prove_turn_chain_recursive`) and verifies
//! through the SAME light-client verifier (`verify_turn_chain_recursive`). This is the proof that
//! PRODUCTION populates the fold: a custom turn proven this way REJECTS a forged `proof_commitment`
//! for a pure light client, with no off-AIR re-execution.
//!
//! The fold is a real recursion (minutes), so both poles are `#[ignore]`. Run with:
//!   cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test custom_binding_production_path -- --ignored --nocapture
