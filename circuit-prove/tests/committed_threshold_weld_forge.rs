//! ADVERSARIAL FORGE PROBE for the value↔fact weld in the committed-threshold
//! predicate disclosure (`circuit/src/dsl/committed_threshold.rs`, welded twin).
//!
//! THE HOLE (now closed): the plain committed-threshold circuit proves
//! `private_value ≥ threshold` and PI-pins `fact_commitment`, but `private_value`
//! (the value the range gadget proves about) was a FREE witness — never tied to the
//! committed fact. A prover could therefore prove "value ≥ threshold" about a value
//! they do NOT hold, against a `fact_commitment` naming a DIFFERENT real fact.
//!
//! The fix opens the fact IN-CIRCUIT (welded descriptor):
//!   fact_hash        == hash_fact(predicate_sym, [private_value, term1, term2])   (C6, `Hash`)
//!   fact_commitment  == Poseidon2(fact_hash, state_root)                          (C7, `Hash2to1`)
//! The SAME `private_value` column feeds BOTH the range gadget AND the fact-hash
//! preimage, so a satisfying assignment forces `private_value` to equal the value
//! inside the committed fact (Poseidon2 collision resistance).
//!
//! Driven through the DEPLOYED, AUDITED Plonky3 prover `prove_dsl_p3`/`verify_dsl_p3`
//! (real Poseidon2 aux blocks for the `Hash`/`Hash2to1` gates), exactly like
//! `non_revocation_p3_boundary.rs`. No hand-written descriptor: the descriptor is
//! the production welded one; only the adversarial TRACE is hand-built.
