//! The 2-leg shielded RING-CLEARING AIR — the note-level algebra realization of DrEX rung-3
//! (`Market/ShieldedClearing.lean::shielded_ring_clears`, fused by
//! `Market/LedgerRealizationExt.lean::shielded_ring_fused_clears`), at the smallest
//! tractable size (`demoShieldedRing` / `fusedRing` scale, 2 legs, 1 pair).
//!
//! ## What this converts (PROVED-SPEC → BUILT at 2-leg)
//!
//! `docs/deos/{ZK-AUCTION-SUITE.md §3.11/§6, SHIELDED-AUCTIONS-DESIGN.md §3 #5/§6}`
//! name the ring-clearing apex AIR as THE single next build between the proved
//! private-matching theorem and a running private auction. The Lean side is a
//! machine-checked theorem: `shielded_ring_fused_clears` — a `CycleValid` ring whose
//! every leg is `LegFused` (the matcher's committed `node.offerAsset`/`offerAmount`
//! ARE a spent member note's `asset`/`value`) settles CONSERVING + FAIR + FUSED over
//! hidden commitments. This module is the silicon: a foldable AIR that verifies that
//! ring over the shielded-spend leaves.
//!
//! ## The three clauses, and where each is enforced (honest map)
//!
//!   * **(a) each leg is a valid shielded spend** — membership (the note is a member
//!     of the tree at `merkle_root`, its full preimage known) + a FRESH nullifier.
//!     This is ALREADY BUILT: it is exactly what
//!     [`crate::shielded_spend_leaf_adapter::prove_shielded_spend_leaf_with_claim`]
//!     proves, exposing `[nullifier, merkle_root, value_binding]`. The apex FOLDS two
//!     such leaves and BINDS the ring-clearing leaf's per-leg claim to them by an
//!     in-circuit `connect` (a forged/mismatched leg is a `connect` conflict ⇒ UNSAT).
//!
//!   * **(b) the RING structure + FUSION** — enforced IN-AIR in the ring-clearing
//!     descriptor over the two legs' plaintext witness:
//!       - FUSION (`LegFused`): `offer_asset[i] == asset[i]` and
//!         `offer_amount[i] == value[i]` — the matcher clears the NOTE, not a
//!         `MatchNode` beside it. The bound to the REAL note rides the value-binding:
//!         the AIR RE-COMPUTES `value_binding[i] = hash_fact(value[i],[asset[i],
//!         randomness[i],0])` (the SAME Poseidon2 fact-sponge the shielded-spend
//!         circuit's C7a publishes — binding (value, asset) jointly under HashCR, the
//!         PQ value-commitment) and the apex `connect`s it to the leaf's exposed
//!         value_binding,
//!         so `value[i]` is provably the spent note's value under Poseidon2 CR.
//!       - RING (`CycleValid` 2-cycle edges): `offer_asset[0] == want_asset[1]` and
//!         `offer_asset[1] == want_asset[0]` (the leg-0-wants-what-leg-1-offers-and-
//!         vice-versa chain), with the TIGHT-cycle amount match `offer_amount[k] ==
//!         want_min[(k+1)%2]` (the `demoShieldedRing`/`fusedRing` swap is tight;
//!         the general `offer_amount ≥ want_min` partial-fill inequality needs an
//!         in-AIR range gadget and is the named N-leg next rung).
//!       - NO IN-RING DOUBLE-SPEND: `nullifier[0] != nullifier[1]` (an inverse-witness
//!         `≠` gate), the circuit twin of the Lean `#guard legA.claim.nullifier !=
//!         legB.claim.nullifier`.
//!
//!   * **(c) CONSERVATION over the Pedersen value commitments** — enforced IN-AIR as
//!     the homomorphic excess `Σ C_in − Σ C_out = 0` over the REAL two-generator
//!     Pedersen `commit v r = (v, r)` (`Dregg2/Shielded/RealCrypto.lean::pedTwoGen`,
//!     whose binding IS DLog): with that commitment the excess is zero iff
//!     `Σ value_in = Σ value_out` AND `Σ blinding_in = Σ blinding_out`, the exact
//!     hypothesis→conclusion of `ring_conserves_pedersen_list`
//!     (`shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden`). The AIR enforces both coordinate
//!     sums, so a value-minting ring (Σ value_out too large) has a NON-zero excess and
//!     is UNSAT — the circuit twin of `RealCrypto.pedCommit_mint_refused`.
//!
//!     **(c.range) THE VALUE RANGE GADGET (the field-soundness weld).** The bare
//!     coordinate sum is a BabyBear FIELD equation, and a field equation alone does NOT
//!     testify to INTEGER conservation: a value-minting ring can satisfy `Σ value_in ≡
//!     Σ value_out (mod p)` by WRAPAROUND (an output committed to `p − k`, a "wrapped
//!     negative"), keeping the field sum fixed while minting real value — a genuine
//!     soundness hole in the pre-range AIR. So every conservation value is now
//!     BIT-DECOMPOSED IN-AIR into `VALUE_BITS` boolean columns that recompose to it,
//!     forcing `value ∈ [0, 2^VALUE_BITS)`. With `RING_LEGS · 2^VALUE_BITS ≤ p`
//!     (compile-time asserted), both per-side sums are `< p` (canonical), so the field
//!     conservation gate IS the integer conservation `Σ value_in = Σ value_out` — the
//!     `hval` hypothesis `RealCrypto.ring_conserves_pedersen_list` consumes
//!     (`RealCrypto.twoLeg_noWrap_conservation` /
//!     `RealCrypto.inAir_conservation_refines_pedersen`). This is the in-AIR realization
//!     of the shielded pool's per-output Bulletproof range proof
//!     (`shielded/pool.rs::output_range_proofs`) — moved from ATTESTED off-AIR to a
//!     CIRCUIT constraint (a wraparound mint is now UNSAT in-AIR, not merely attested
//!     out-of-range). No amount is revealed: the values (and their bit witnesses) live
//!     only in the witness (hidden under the hiding PCS); the apex exposes the note
//!     claim prefix plus the constrained endpoint surface, never the amounts themselves.
//!
//! ## HONEST GRADE — 2-leg BUILT; what is in-AIR vs the leaf's exposed claim
//!
//!   * The Pedersen conservation (c) is enforced IN-AIR at the aggregate level (Σ value
//!     + Σ blinding), matching `ring_conserves_pedersen_list` (the 2-generator
//!     `pedTwoGen`, NOT the multi-generator asset commitment); the per-ASSET routing
//!     is carried by the ring edges (b), exactly the two-weld split of the Lean.
//!     PROVED-IN-CIRCUIT: the VALUE-conservation soundness — that the field gate is the
//!     integer conservation, no wraparound mint — is now a CIRCUIT constraint via the
//!     range gadget (c.range), retiring the ATTESTED off-AIR range-proof residual for
//!     the BabyBear-scale (`< 2^VALUE_BITS`) range. NAMED RESIDUAL (still off-AIR /
//!     ATTESTED): (i) the full 64-bit amount range — one BabyBear field caps a 2-leg
//!     conserving sum near `2^30`, so amounts above `2^VALUE_BITS` still lean on the
//!     off-AIR Bulletproof; (ii) full in-AIR Ristretto EC arithmetic — the conservation
//!     runs over the two-COORDINATE `pedTwoGen (v, r)` abstraction, NOT the real group
//!     point `v·G + r·H` over Ristretto; realizing the actual curve-point excess in-AIR
//!     is the EC-in-circuit build named next; (iii) the blinding coordinate's faithful
//!     (group-scalar) reduction, which rides the off-AIR Schnorr excess (a blinding
//!     wraparound mints no value, so it is out of THIS weld's scope).
//!   * The fusion value `value[i]` is bound to the real spent note THROUGH the leaf's
//!     value_binding (Poseidon2 CR), re-computed in-AIR here and `connect`ed to the
//!     leaf's exposed lane 2 — it is NOT a fresh in-AIR opening of a curve point. This
//!     is the same DECO posture the shielded-spend leaf already documents (lane 2 =
//!     the ATTESTED off-AIR Pedersen link); here that link is made a load-bearing
//!     in-AIR fusion gate rather than an off-AIR attestation.
//!   * SCOPE: this is the 2-leg (single-pair), TIGHT-cycle realization. The N-leg
//!     generalization (a variable-length cycle, the `offer_amount ≥ want_min`
//!     partial-fill inequality via an in-AIR range gadget) and the launchpad/DEX
//!     integration (§3.3/§3.12/§3.13) are the next rungs, named not built.
//!   * **ENDPOINT BOUNDARY (load-bearing):** this leaf additionally proves two ordinary
//!     balance-action rows (creator/receiver/asset/amount, funded pre/post balances,
//!     authorization and lifecycle), advances the receipt root by those two actions, and
//!     publishes genuine eight-lane pre/post commitments over two 178-limb kernel blocks.
//!     Every published endpoint lane is a PI pin to a constrained wide Poseidon carrier;
//!     the forged-endpoint KATs below demonstrate that these are not metadata carriers.
