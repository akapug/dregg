//! Re-prove a `custom` effect's `CellProgram` sub-proof as a RECURSION-FOLDABLE
//! IR-v2 leaf (Fork X).
//!
//! ## What this closes
//!
//! Today a custom effect's external program proof is a bespoke
//! [`dregg_circuit::dsl::circuit::CellProgram`] STARK
//! ([`dregg_circuit::stark`]). The deployed `proof_bind` engine
//! ([`crate::custom_proof_bind`]) verifies it OFF-AIR — a re-executing validator
//! runs `CellProgram::verify_transition`, but a PURE LIGHT CLIENT (one that only
//! folds the per-turn recursion tree) never witnesses it. The custom leg is the
//! one effect family whose soundness a light client cannot currently see.
//!
//! This module adapts the `CellProgram`'s [`CircuitDescriptor`] into an
//! [`EffectVmDescriptor2`] (the EPOCH multi-table grammar), proves it through the
//! GENERAL IR-v2 prover ([`prove_vm_descriptor2_for_config`]), and wraps the
//! result as a recursion leaf via the existing
//! [`prove_descriptor_leaf_rotated_with_config`] machinery. The output is the same
//! [`RecursionOutput<DreggRecursionConfig>`] every other descriptor leaf produces,
//! so a custom sub-proof now folds into the SAME `aggregate_tree` / chain a light
//! client verifies.
//!
//! ## The constraint mapping (`CellProgram` `ConstraintExpr` → `VmConstraint2`)
//!
//! The IR-v2 `main` table interprets the embedded v1 forms
//! ([`VmConstraint::Gate`]/[`VmConstraint::Transition`]/[`VmConstraint::PiBinding`])
//! over the same domains the v1 AIR used. Each pure-LOCAL algebraic `ConstraintExpr`
//! lowers to a single `Base(Gate(body))` whose `body` polynomial must vanish:
//!
//! | `ConstraintExpr`        | maps to                                             |
//! |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Equality`              | `Base(Gate(a − b))`                                 |
//! | `Multiplication`        | `Base(Gate(a·b − out))`                             |
//! | `Binary`                | `Base(Gate(c·(c − 1)))`                             |
//! | `Polynomial`            | `Base(Gate(Σ coeffᵢ·∏ colⱼ))`                      |
//! | `Gated`                 | `Base(Gate(sel · inner_body))`                      |
//! | `InvertedGated`         | `Base(Gate((1 − sel) · inner_body))`               |
//! | `Squared`               | `Base(Gate(inner_body²))`                           |
//! | `ConditionalNonzero`    | `Base(Gate(sel·(val·inv − 1)))`                    |
//! | `AtLeastOne`            | `Base(Gate(∏ (1 − flagᵢ)))`                        |
//! | `Transition`            | `WindowGate(Nxt(next) − Loc(local))` on transition  |
//! | `PiBinding`             | `Base(PiBinding{First, col, pi})` (see note)        |
//!
//! `Transition` is realized as a [`WindowGate`] (the two-row primitive that reads
//! BOTH the current `Loc` and next `Nxt` row), NOT `Base(VmConstraint::Transition)`:
//! the latter hard-codes the EffectVM `state_before`/`state_after` window bases
//! (`EFFECTVM_STATE_BEFORE_BASE = 54`, `..._AFTER_BASE = 76`), so it cannot express
//! a generic `next[c] == local[c]` over arbitrary `CellProgram` columns. The
//! `WindowGate` is the faithful, column-general carrier and asserts on the same
//! transition domain (rows `0..n−2`) as a `CellProgram` cross-row constraint.
//!
//! **`PiBinding` note (a NAMED narrowing, not a hole):** a `CellProgram`
//! `ConstraintExpr::PiBinding` is a per-row gate `local[col] − pi[idx] == 0`, but a
//! per-row PI-reading gate is INEXPRESSIBLE in the IR-v2 `LeanExpr` (it reads only
//! columns, never public values). The faithful IR-v2 carrier is
//! `VmConstraint::PiBinding`, which is row-tag-guarded (first/last only); this
//! adapter emits a `First`-row binding, which NARROWS the semantics from every-row
//! to first-row. The follow-up is a per-row PI gate in the IR-v2 main AIR. The demo
//! program below does not use `PiBinding`, so this narrowing is not on the proven path.
//!
//! ## Poseidon2 hash sites — the LANE-WITNESSING extension (now mapped)
//!
//! `Hash2to1` / `Hash4to1` / `Hash3Cap` / `MerkleHash` / `MerkleHash8` lower to `Lookup`s
//! into the declared Poseidon2 CHIP table (`TID_P2`). One permutation = one 25-wide chip
//! tuple `[arity, in0..in15 (CHIP_RATE), out0..out7]`; the chip-table AIR EQUALITY-binds all
//! 8 output lanes to the genuine permutation (`out[i] == perm(ins)[i]`), so a forged
//! digest OR a forged intermediate lane is UNSAT.
//!
//! Sites come in two SHAPES, differing only in who owns the 8 output columns:
//!
//! * **SINGLE-output** (`Hash2to1` / `Hash4to1` / `Hash3Cap` / `MerkleHash`) — the program
//!   squeezes lane 0. The digest (lane 0/out0) is the site's own output column, already
//!   filled by the `CellProgram`'s `generate_trace`; the 7 remaining lane columns are
//!   ALLOCATED past the base trace width per site and filled descriptor-side by
//!   `fill_chip_lanes` (the `trace_with_chip_lanes` weld). The program never reads lanes
//!   1..7 — they exist only so the AIR equalities pin the permutation. A single-output
//!   site therefore binds ~31 bits of digest and pays 7 columns to do it.
//! * **MULTI-output** (`MerkleHash8`) — the native 8-felt `cap_node8(L8, R8)`, which is
//!   DEFINED as `chip_absorb_all_lanes(CHIP_NODE8_ARITY, L8 ‖ R8)`, i.e. literally ONE
//!   arity-16 chip absorb. All 8 lanes are PROGRAM-OWNED columns, so the site allocates NO
//!   lane columns at all and binds the FULL 8-felt (~124-bit) digest. Arity 16 was already
//!   in the chip AIR's arity set `{0,2,3,4,7,11,16}`, already seeds all 16 permutation lanes
//!   from genuine inputs, and the chip table already mints node8 rows — the site rides the
//!   SAME tuple and the SAME `out[i] == perm(ins)[i]` equalities as every narrow site. The
//!   adapter previously REFUSED this kind purely because its tuple builder hard-coded
//!   "lane 0 is the output, lanes 1..7 are anonymous witnesses"; that was an adapter
//!   limitation, never a soundness boundary. A foldable leaf that must FOLD an 8-felt
//!   Merkle tree (e.g. `dsl::cap_membership`) is therefore no longer forced onto 8 parallel
//!   domain-separated single-output chains to reach a real collision floor. `MerkleHash`'s
//! position-ordered child reconstruction is emitted as degree-4 Lagrange-indicator chip
//! inputs (so the chip absorb's children match the evaluator at every grid position
//! `{0,1,2,3}`, pinned by the program's own position-validity gate). A Merkle PATH is a
//! chain of these sites (parent → next `current` via `Transition`) with the leaf/root
//! pinned to PIs by the boundary `PiBinding`s — see the tooth tests. This mirrors the
//! cap_root/heap_root in-circuit Merkle-open (a witnessed sibling path, constrained
//! recompute), and is the shared primitive every hash-heavy carrier's path verification
//! rides.
//!
//! ## The running-hash chain — the COPY-FORWARD extension (now mapped)
//!
//! `ChainedHash2to1 { out, seed, input }` is a CROSS-ROW running hash `next[out] ==
//! hash_2_to_1(local[seed], next[input])`; a single-row `TID_P2` lookup reads only the
//! `local` window, so it cannot reach the `next` input. The faithful carrier is a fresh
//! COPY-FORWARD accumulator column `acc`: a per-row chip `out == hash_2_to_1(acc, input)`,
//! a `WindowGate` copy-forward `next[acc] − local[seed] == 0` (so `acc[i+1]` = the prior
//! accumulator), and the chain's first-row seed `acc[0] == pi[seed_pi]` from its paired
//! `SeedHash2to1`. This reproduces BOTH the `ChainedHash2to1` rolling step AND the
//! `SeedHash2to1` table-commitment seed of `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` byte-for-byte; the `acc`
//! column is witnessed descriptor-side ([`fill_chain_columns`]) and the chip equality-binds
//! `out` to the genuine permutation, so a forged accumulator / broken chain is UNSAT.
//!
//! ## The transition table — `TableFunction` → its bivariate-Lagrange gate (now mapped)
//!
//! `TableFunction { a, b, out, .. }` (the GAP-A `next == step(state, symbol)`) lowers to the
//! pure-local gate `out − Σ_i Σ_j outputs[i·|b|+j]·Lᵢ(a)·Lⱼ(b)` (`Lᵢ` a Lagrange indicator
//! over the grid, exactly as `MerkleHash`'s position reconstruction). The paired grid-range
//! vanishing gates pin `(a, b)` onto the grid, so the interpolant is evaluated only at real
//! grid points. With these three, `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` FULLY lowers to a foldable leaf.
//!
//! ## Constraint kinds this extension does NOT map (precise blockers, not fakes)
//!
//! * `Hash` — the capacity-tagged fact-sponge `hash_fact(predicate, terms)` uses the
//!   arity-7 cap-leaf / `FACT_MARK` fact-bus seeding (state[5]=FACT_MARK, state[6]=1),
//!   NOT a narrow arity-2/3/4 absorb. Mapping it needs the chip's fact-bus path
//!   (`BUS_FACT`) — the named follow-up.
//! * `Lookup { table_id, .. }` — a `CellProgram` lookup names an arbitrary
//!   entry-set `LookupTable`. The IR-v2 `Lookup` targets DECLARED tables with FIXED
//!   semantics (range / chip / submask), not arbitrary entry sets, so there is no
//!   faithful target. Mapping it needs an IR-v2 "custom-contents" table family
//!   (the named small IR follow-up). `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` does NOT use it (it routes
//!   through `TableFunction`, which is now mapped).
//! * An UNSEEDED `ChainedHash2to1` (no paired first-row `SeedHash2to1`) and a standalone
//!   `SeedHash2to1` (no chain accumulating its output) — the per-row chip would
//!   over-constrain row 0 (resp. needs a first-row-ONLY chip gate). No deployed carrier
//!   hits these; the named residual.
//! * `BoundaryRow::Index` — an absolute-row boundary has no IR-v2 row-tag carrier
//!   (`when_first_row`/`when_last_row` only); the named residual.
//!
//! ## The remaining seam to the per-turn fold
//!
//! `prove_custom_leaf` carries the `CellProgram`'s public inputs as the leaf's
//! descriptor PIs (bound in-circuit — a tampered PI is UNSAT). The value the
//! deployed effect-VM `custom_proof_commitment` column must equal is
//! [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`] of those PIs. The OPEN seam is exposing that
//! Poseidon2 commitment as an in-circuit-computed CLAIM (an `expose` hook computing
//! `WideHash::from_poseidon2` over the bound PIs, the way
//! `prove_descriptor_leaf_rotated_with_segment` computes its segment digest
//! in-circuit) and connecting it to the EffectVM Custom row's `proof_bind` column.
//!
//! ## G2 status — the in-circuit commitment expose hook ([`prove_custom_leaf_with_commitment`])
//!
//! [`incircuit_custom_pi_commitment`] is the FAITHFUL in-circuit reconstruction of
//! [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`]: a width-16 BabyBear Poseidon2 (KAT-locked to
//! `default_babybear_poseidon2_16`, the SAME permutation [`WideHash::from_poseidon2`]'s
//! `Poseidon2State` runs) driven as the host's ADDITIVE rate-4 sponge — each four-PI chunk
//! packed into ext limb 0 (base lanes 0..4; chunks past the first are ADDED into the returned
//! rate and chained with `new_start = false`, capacity off-bus), the BLAKE3 domain seed + input
//! length in limb 1 (lanes 4,5) as the INITIAL rate state only, the
//! zero capacity tail in limbs 2,3. The host commitment is `to_felts()[0..4]` = the rate AFTER
//! the last absorb permutation, so only the absorb phase is reconstructed. The domain seed enters
//! as a compile-time `Const` (no in-circuit BLAKE3); `domain_seed_matches_widehash` pins it.
//!
//! The leaf PROVES, and its in-circuit-exposed 4-felt commitment is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the host
//! [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`] (the `incircuit_commitment_byte_matches_host` /
//! `incircuit_commitment_binds_pis` tests). The host commitment is `to_felts()[0..4]` = the 4
//! CONSECUTIVE base lanes 0,1,2,3 of one perm-output ext limb (verified in `binding.rs`). Exposing
//! those 4 base felts requires `decompose_ext_to_base_coeffs(out[0])` and exposing the
//! coefficients — and those per-coefficient base values must appear on the `WitnessChecks` bus, or
//! `expose_claim`'s per-coeff RECEIVE has no creator (the prior empirical failure:
//! `WitnessChecks tuple [...] net multiplicity p−1` = one unmatched RECEIVE, instance 5 row 0).
//! The fork's mechanism for exactly this is the `recompose/coeff` table, enabled on the expose path
//! by `set_recompose_coeff_ctl_for_decompose_links(true)`. The leaf-wrap backend registers that
//! table's prover / preprocessor / air-builder ONLY when
//! `cl = challenger.extension_degree() != D || force_coeff_lookups` (`recursion/src/backend/fri.rs`);
//! the first disjunct is FALSE for the D=4 width-16 challenger this config uses, so the leaf uses the
//! coeff-forced backend [`create_recursion_backend_with_coeff_lookups`] (fork rev `be52a51`'s
//! `with_coeff_lookups()` flag) to OR the gate true. The table is inert for non-custom leaves (which
//! never take the coeff-ctl decompose path), so existing leaves' VKs do not move. (The seg digest
//! sidesteps the bus entirely: its host digest is lanes 0,4,8,12 = coeff-0 of separate ext limbs,
//! exposable as-is with no decompose; the consecutive-lane custom commitment cannot.)
//!
//! ## The connect-into-the-fold step — DEPLOYED (the binding is REAL for a pure light client)
//!
//! The exposed claim is connected to the effect-vm leg's published `custom_proof_commitment` (IR2
//! PI slots 46..53 — the 8-felt flag-day exposure) IN THE DEPLOYED CHAIN PROVER. For a custom turn,
//! [`crate::ivc_turn_chain::prove_chain_core_rotated`] mints a DUAL-EXPOSE leg leaf
//! ([`crate::ivc_turn_chain::prove_descriptor_leaf_dual_expose`] — its single `expose_claim` carries
//! the chain SEGMENT in lanes `[0 .. SEG_WIDTH)` AND the claimed commitment in lanes
//! `[SEG_WIDTH ..)`) and folds it against a custom sub-proof leaf.
//!
//! **THE DEPLOYED PAIR IS THE STATE-BINDING ONE**, not the commitment-only leaf documented above:
//! `prove_chain_core_rotated` mints [`prove_custom_leaf_with_state_commitment`] (the 24-lane claim)
//! under [`crate::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_state_segmented`]. That node
//! `connect`s the commitments in-circuit AND welds the sub-proof's declared `[old8 ‖ new8]` to the
//! leg's real rotated roots, then re-exposes the segment so the node folds into `aggregate_tree`
//! like any segment leaf. TWO turns are UNSAT: one whose leg claims a commitment no verifying
//! sub-proof backs, and one carrying a verifying sub-proof about a DIFFERENT transition. No root
//! exists, so a PURE LIGHT CLIENT verifying the deployed `WholeChainProof` never receives a
//! verifying artifact. The premise of Lean `CustomBindingFromFold.custom_binding_from_fold` is TRUE
//! on the deployed path.
//!
//! [`prove_custom_leaf_with_commitment`] (8-lane) is retained as the MECHANISM tooth and as the
//! canary the state leg is measured against — it is not on the deployed path.
//!
//! The two formerly-blocking threads are landed: (1) the custom sub-proof's re-provable witness
//! (`CellProgram` + trace witness + PIs) is retained PROVER-SIDE on
//! [`crate::joint_turn_aggregation::RotatedParticipantLeg::custom_witness`] (NEVER on the wire
//! `dregg_turn::CustomProgramProof`, which a light client sees), and (2) the dual-claim leaf +
//! segment-preserving binding node carry the segment AND the commitment. End-to-end honest-accept +
//! forged-reject through `prove_turn_chain_recursive` → `verify_turn_chain_recursive` is pinned by
//! `circuit-prove/tests/custom_binding_deployed_tooth.rs`. The single-claim
//! [`crate::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node`] + the
//! `forged_custom_commitment_is_rejected_by_the_fold` stand-in tooth remain as the minimal MECHANISM
//! teeth.

    // (upstream blocker #2 flag day): every equality below is over BOTH squeeze
    // blocks, so the ladder pins the absorb schedule AND the genuine second
    // squeeze permutation. The old 4-felt expected values changed by
    // construction (they are re-derived from the NEW 8-felt host derivation,
    // never kept stale).
    //
    // Host/in-circuit equality is checked by EXECUTING the real gadget circuit
    // (CircuitRunner witness generation over the same enabled Poseidon2/recompose
    // ops the leaf wrap proves) — no FRI, so the whole length ladder is cheap.
    // The host side is the untouched `custom_proof_pi_commitment`
    // (`WideHash::from_poseidon2` over `Poseidon2State`, a fully independent
    // implementation), so the two paths share NO code: agreement pins the absorb
    // schedule (chunking, domain/len lanes, capacity chaining, no padding block,
    // no squeeze permute) byte-for-byte. The genuine end-to-end pole (the gadget
    // proving inside the leaf wrap and exposing through `expose_claim`) is the
    // 32-PI leaf test below.
