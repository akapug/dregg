//! Types + the canonical PI-commitment derivation for the `custom` effect's
//! `proof_bind`. **The binding itself is NOT enforced here** — it is enforced by the
//! deployed recursion fold. This module is the host-side derivation surface that fold
//! binds.
//!
//! ## Where the binding actually lives
//!
//! The deployed `customVmDescriptor2R24` carries one `DescriptorIR2.ProofBind` op naming
//! the Custom row's `custom_proof_commitment` column (var 72) and `custom_program_vk_hash`
//! column (var 68). At the descriptor-IR level that op only *declares* the binding: the
//! in-AIR check is a bounds check (`descriptor_ir2.rs`, `VmConstraint2::ProofBind`), and
//! the EffectVM AIR's Custom leg (`effect_vm/air.rs`) does NOT verify the external proof.
//! On its own the row's claimed commitment is therefore UNBACKED.
//!
//! It is backed IN-CIRCUIT by the chain prover's custom fold arm:
//! [`crate::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_segmented`], wired into
//! [`crate::ivc_turn_chain::prove_chain_core_rotated`]. That node folds two leaves — the
//! effect-vm leg as a DUAL-EXPOSE leaf (chain segment + the claimed 8-felt commitment from
//! PI 46..53) and the custom SUB-PROOF leaf re-proven from the retained
//! `CustomWitnessBundle` ([`crate::custom_leaf_adapter::prove_custom_leaf_with_commitment`],
//! whose commitment is computed in-circuit) — and `connect`s the claimed lanes to the
//! genuine ones.
//!
//! **The tooth:** a turn whose effect-vm row claims a commitment no verifying sub-proof
//! backs is UNSAT. There is no satisfying custom leaf whose exposed commitment equals the
//! claimed slots, so the aggregate does not prove — no root, and a pure light client
//! (which folds the recursion tree and never witnesses the sub-proof off-AIR) never
//! receives a verifying artifact.
//!
//! ## Provenance of this module's shape
//!
//! The off-AIR hand-STARK engine that used to live here — `prove_custom_program` /
//! `verify_bound_custom_proof` / `verify_proof_bind` — died with stark-kill (`dd038c08e`).
//! Nothing in the tree verifies a proof-bind off-AIR any more. What survives here is
//! types + [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`], the canonical derivation the fold binds against.
//!
//! ## The teeth (both polarities, and where they run)
//!
//! * `every_forged_commitment_lane_is_rejected_by_the_fold` (in-lib, `joint_turn_recursive`)
//!   — the MECHANISM tooth. Forges each of the 8 lanes INDEPENDENTLY (`k in 0..8`), which is
//!   what makes the SECOND squeeze block load-bearing: a node binding only the first 4 would
//!   accept the `k in 4..8` forgeries. It runs on a plain `cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove`
//!   (no `#[ignore]`). **Scope:** it drives
//!   [`crate::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node`] — the single-claim variant —
//!   over a stand-in leg. That is the connect MECHANISM, not the deployed wiring.
//! * `circuit-prove/tests/custom_binding_deployed_tooth.rs` and
//!   `custom_binding_production_path.rs` — the DEPLOYED poles: honest-accept + forged-reject
//!   end-to-end through `prove_turn_chain_recursive` → `verify_turn_chain_recursive`.
//!   **⚠ Both are `#[ignore]`d and nothing in CI passes `--ignored`, so the deployed
//!   end-to-end poles are not exercised in automation at HEAD** (`CRATE-EXCELLENCE-PLAN.md`
//!   §4 MOVE 2 is the lane that arms them).
//!
//! So at HEAD the connect mechanism is gated in automation and the deployed wiring is not.
//!
//! ## How the sub-proof binds (the two columns)
//!
//! * `custom_program_vk_hash` (8 felts, EffectVM PI `CUSTOM_PROOFS_BASE + i*12 +
//!   0..8`; column 68 in the rotated descriptor) — the program identity, the
//!   32-byte [`CellProgram::vk_hash`] mapped through
//!   [`dregg_circuit::effect_vm::bytes32_to_8_limbs`]. A re-executing validator resolves
//!   the program by this hash through the host [`ProgramRegistry`], where an unregistered
//!   `vk_hash` does not resolve. On the deployed FOLD path there is no registry lookup:
//!   the sub-proof leaf is re-proven from the program carried on the retained
//!   `CustomWitnessBundle`.
//! * `custom_proof_commitment` (8 felts, EffectVM PI `... + 8..16`; limbs 0..4
//!   at column 72, limbs 4..8 on the member-local commit-teeth columns)
//!   — [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`] of the sub-proof's public inputs. The fold's
//!   custom leaf computes this commitment IN-CIRCUIT from the sub-proof's real PIs
//!   ([`crate::custom_leaf_adapter::incircuit_custom_pi_commitment`]) and `connect`s it,
//!   lane by lane, to the claimed column; a swapped or fabricated commitment has no
//!   satisfying partner and the aggregation is UNSAT.
//!
//! Both are bound into the turn hash (`turn::Turn::hash`) via
//! `custom_program_proofs`, so the sub-proof bytes + PI cannot be swapped after
//! the fact without changing the turn identity.
