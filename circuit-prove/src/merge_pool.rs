//! The TREE-SCAN-STATE aggregation infra — the merge-pool + the frontier/driver that make proof
//! AGGREGATION parallelize (throughput ∝ worker count, farmable to a GPU / machine pool).
//!
//! ## The serial cap this closes
//!
//! [`ivc_turn_chain::aggregate_tree`](crate::ivc_turn_chain) folds K segment-carrying descriptor
//! leaves to one root through a balanced binary tree, but it runs as a single-threaded
//! `while proofs.len() > 1` loop: every internal node is proven sequentially, so a prover POOL
//! cannot help — the bottleneck is the `while`, not a shortage of provers. Yet a balanced tree's
//! internal nodes at the same depth are INDEPENDENT: node `(2i, 2i+1)` and node `(2j, 2j+1)` share
//! no inputs and can be proven on different cores / GPUs / machines at the same time. Each merge is
//! also a PURE, side-effect-free function ([`merge_two_segment_proofs`]) whose inputs and
//! result-of-interest are the `Send`, serde [`BatchStarkProof`] (NOT the `!Send`
//! `Rc<CircuitProverData>`, which no downstream merge or verifier ever reads — exactly the
//! verify-sufficient subset [`WholeChainProofBytes`](crate::ivc_turn_chain::WholeChainProofBytes)
//! ships over a wire). So the merge is the natural FARM-ABLE unit.
//!
//! ## The two atoms
//!
//!   1. **[`MergePool`]** — the merge worker-pool: `N` workers pull [`MergeJob`]s (each = two child
//!      proofs + the tree-node id they produce) from a bounded queue, prove the merge with their own
//!      thread-local config + backend, and ship back the parent [`BatchStarkProof`]. It mirrors the
//!      base per-turn [`prove_pool`](../../node/src/prove_pool.rs) pattern (an `Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>`
//!      pulled by a fixed worker set), tunable via `DREGG_MERGE_WORKERS` /
//!      `DREGG_MERGE_QUEUE_DEPTH`. Because each job is independent and `Send`, throughput scales with
//!      the worker/machine count — a from-scratch GPU farm drains the same queue.
//!
//!   2. **[`aggregate_tree_scan_state`]** — the scan-state DRIVER: instead of a one-shot level loop,
//!      it builds the SAME balanced-tree DAG `aggregate_tree` walks (identical pairing, identical odd
//!      promotion), holds a FRONTIER of ready merge-pairs, feeds the merge-pool as nodes become
//!      ready, and consumes completed root-ward proofs — enqueuing the constant new work each
//!      completion unlocks ("base-leaf completions enqueue `(left,right)` pairs; the pool drains
//!      them; the chain consumes completed work"). Because every node delegates to the SAME
//!      [`merge_two_segment_proofs`] the serial tree uses, the parallel root is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
//!      serial root (witness: the `scan_state_root_equals_serial_root` test) — same answer, parallel
//!      path.
//!
//! ## Depth-4-anchored NOW; uniform-unbounded once the canonical seed lands
//!
//! This driver works over the CURRENT depth-4-anchored form (the running-VK fixed point reached at
//! depth 4; see [`accumulator`](crate::accumulator)). It is a pure DRIVER/QUEUE change — the
//! per-node math (continuity `connect` + count-add + ordered Poseidon digest) is untouched. Once the
//! canonical-seed lane lands the uniform unbounded-depth VK, the same merge-pool/driver farm over the
//! fully-uniform tree with no change to this file's structure.
