//! Re-prove a `Witnessed { Dfa }` predicate's `CellProgram` transition as a
//! RECURSION-FOLDABLE IR-v2 leaf — the DSL/Dfa twin of [`crate::custom_leaf_adapter`].
//!
//! ## What this closes (the RE-EXEC-ONLY gap)
//!
//! A `Dfa` caveat (the relay-routing predicate `dregg-dfa-routing-v1`, and any deployed
//! `CellProgram` predicate) is verified OFF-AIR by
//! `turn::executor::membership_verifier::DslCircuitDfaVerifier::verify`, which resolves the
//! program by its `vk_hash` and calls
//! [`dregg_circuit::dsl::circuit::CellProgram::verify_transition`] →
//! [`dregg_circuit::stark::verify`] (the bespoke `circuit/src/stark.rs` STARK). That gate runs in
//! the executor's witnessed-predicate registry, NOT inside the deployed effect-vm AIR. So a
//! re-executing validator witnesses the predicate, but a PURE LIGHT CLIENT (one that folds only the
//! per-turn recursion tree) never does: a validator with vs without `DslCircuitDfaVerifier`
//! registered produces the SAME `AttestedHistory` for a `Dfa`-gated turn. The Lean refutation is
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.DslBackingAttack` (`deployed_admits_unwitnessed`).
//!
//! The Dfa predicate is even MORE invisible to a light client than the custom carrier: a custom
//! effect at least has an in-AIR `proofBind` op (whose deployed denotation is the vacuous `True`),
//! whereas the Dfa predicate is a precondition CAVEAT with NO op on the deployed turn at all.
//!
//! ## The fix is REUSE — a DSL/Dfa transition IS a `CellProgram` STARK
//!
//! The carrier is, byte for byte, the SAME object the custom carrier re-proves: a `CellProgram`
//! transition proven through `dregg_circuit::stark` and verified by `CellProgram::verify_transition`.
//! So the leaf machinery is DIRECT REUSE of [`crate::custom_leaf_adapter`]:
//!
//! * [`crate::custom_leaf_adapter::cellprogram_to_descriptor2`] adapts the program's
//!   [`dregg_circuit::dsl::circuit::CircuitDescriptor`] into the IR-v2 grammar, and
//! * [`crate::custom_leaf_adapter::prove_custom_leaf_with_commitment`] proves it as a foldable leaf
//!   that EXPOSES its PI-commitment in-circuit (the faithful in-AIR reconstruction of
//!   [`crate::custom_proof_bind::custom_proof_pi_commitment`] — the value a DSL `DfaProofWire`'s
//!   public inputs commit to). The exposed claim is the SAME 4-felt commitment shape a custom leaf
//!   exposes, so the binding node REUSES too (see [`prove_dsl_binding_node_segmented`]).
//!
//! [`prove_dsl_leaf_with_commitment`] is the thin DSL-named entrypoint; it simply routes the DSL/Dfa
//! `CellProgram` through that machinery. A light client folding the resulting leaf now witnesses the
//! DSL predicate transition the off-AIR `DslCircuitDfaVerifier` used to be the sole enforcer of.
//!
//! ## THE REAL GAP — which DSL programs reuse, and which hit the named carrier blockers
//!
//! [`cellprogram_to_descriptor2`] maps the PURE-ALGEBRAIC `ConstraintExpr` kinds
//! (`Equality`/`Multiplication`/`Binary`/`Polynomial`/`Gated`/`InvertedGated`/`Squared`/
//! `ConditionalNonzero`/`AtLeastOne`/`Transition`/`PiBinding`) faithfully, the Poseidon2-relation
//! kinds (`Hash2to1`/`Hash4to1`/`Hash3Cap`/`MerkleHash`) via the `TID_P2` lane-witnessing weld, the
//! cross-row running hash (`ChainedHash2to1` + its `SeedHash2to1` seed) via a copy-forward accumulator
//! column, and `TableFunction` via its bivariate-Lagrange gate. It still REFUSES the arity-7 fact-sponge
//! `Hash`, an arbitrary-entry `Lookup`, an UNSEEDED chain, and `BoundaryRow::Index` (the named residuals).
//!
//! Consequence, stated honestly:
//!
//! * An **algebraic DSL/Dfa transition** (a state-advance / continuity predicate over arithmetic
//!   columns, e.g. [`tests::dfa_advance_program`]) REUSES the custom leaf machinery DIRECTLY — it
//!   folds and exposes a bound PI-commitment with ZERO new mechanism.
//! * The **production `dregg-dfa-routing-v1`** descriptor now ALSO fully reuses: its `Hash4to1`
//!   (entry-hash C1), `ChainedHash2to1` (running-hash C3) + `SeedHash2to1` (the table-commitment
//!   seed), and `TableFunction` (the GAP-A transition table) all lower to the foldable IR-2 leaf
//!   (`TID_P2` chip lookups + the copy-forward accumulator + the Lagrange gate). A light client
//!   folding the leaf witnesses the routing predicate's hash chain + transition table in-AIR.
//!   [`dsl_leaf_unmapped_kinds`] reports a program's gap precisely (now empty for the router);
//!   [`tests::routing_descriptor_fully_maps`] pins the full lowering on the real descriptor, and the
//!   honest-folds / forged-UNSAT teeth live in `custom_leaf_adapter`'s `*_dfa_routing_*` tests.
//!
//! ## The rc-EMIT LANDED — the deployed-descriptor PI exposure for the Dfa leg (LIVE)
//!
//! The fold-bind needs a DEPLOYED leg leaf that RE-EXPOSES the Dfa predicate's published commitment at
//! a known PI slot range, so [`prove_dsl_binding_node_segmented`] can `connect` it to this sub-proof
//! leaf's genuine in-circuit commitment (exactly as the custom path connects the effect-vm leg's PI
//! slots 46..49 — `customPiExposure` / `customVmDescriptor2R24`). The Dfa predicate is a PRECONDITION
//! CAVEAT, not an effect — and the named big-bang emit LANDED: every deployed cohort member is wrapped
//! through Lean `withDfaRcPins`, publishing the caveat-region 4-felt DFA route-commitment carrier
//! (`trace_rotated::C_DFA_RC_OFF`, filled from `RotatedCaveatManifest::dfa_rc` =
//! `dfa_route_commitment(DfaProofWire.public_inputs)` on a Dfa-gated turn, the ZERO sentinel
//! otherwise) as member PIs — transfer at 46..49; post-exposure members vary, so the fold arm DERIVES
//! the slots from the committed descriptor (`crate::ivc_turn_chain::dsl_rc_claim_pi_lo`).
//!
//! THE DEPLOYED WIRE IS LIVE: `prove_chain_core_rotated`'s `CarrierWitness::Dsl` arm mints the
//! DUAL-EXPOSE Dfa leg leaf ([`crate::ivc_turn_chain::prove_descriptor_leaf_dual_expose_at`] at the
//! derived rc slots), re-proves the predicate through [`prove_dsl_leaf_with_commitment`], and folds
//! both under [`prove_dsl_binding_node_segmented`] — refusing pin-less descriptors AND the zero rc
//! sentinel (fail-closed both poles). The deployed-path tooth is
//! `tests/dsl_binding_deployed_tooth.rs`; the Lean flip is `Dregg2.Circuit.DslBindingFromFold`.
