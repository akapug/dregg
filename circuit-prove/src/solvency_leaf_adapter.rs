//! The SOLVENCY leaf — a real reserve-covers-liabilities STARK re-proven as a
//! RECURSION-FOLDABLE IR-v2 leaf, exposing a committed solvency claim. The first
//! FINANCIAL leaf of the "everything is a leaf" moat (`docs/deos/DREGGFI-AMBITION.md`
//! §B.2 #1): a structured product is a single apex proof that folds N sub-proofs as
//! leaves, and this is the solvency face of it.
//!
//! ## What this leaf proves (the instance) — and what it does NOT (the ∀-schedule)
//!
//! The leaf proves ONE reserve state is solvent: for a hidden reserve `R` and hidden
//! liabilities `L`, `R ≥ L`, exposing the committed tuple `[reserve_commit,
//! liability_commit]` where `reserve_commit = hash_fact(R, [salt_r,0,0,0])` and
//! `liability_commit = hash_fact(L, [salt_l,0,0,0])`. This is the CIRCUIT-grade
//! instance solvency: "this reserve state covers its liabilities, and here are the
//! two commitments that bind it".
//!
//! The ∀-SCHEDULE solvency — that the reserve fund is never negative along EVERY
//! adversarial attest/reverse/spend/finalize schedule — is the Lean tower
//! `Dregg2/Verify/StripeReserve.lean` (`stripe_reserve_solvent_forever`, the
//! `escrow_solvent_forever` apex over `SSched`, `#assert_axioms`-clean). This leaf
//! does NOT re-prove that; it proves an instance the Lean invariant abstracts, and
//! composes with it by citation (the Lean theorem says the reserve state STAYS
//! solvent; this leaf says a GIVEN state IS solvent, as a foldable proof).
//!
//! ## The range gadget (the ride) — the same `attest.rs` non-negativity carrier
//!
//! `R ≥ L` over a prime field is `diff = R − L ∈ [0, 2^RANGE_BITS)`, proven by
//! witnessing `diff` and a bit decomposition `diff = Σ bit_i·2^i` over `RANGE_BITS`
//! `Binary`-gated columns, with a `Polynomial` reconstruction pinning `Σ bit_i·2^i −
//! diff == 0` and a link `R − L − diff == 0`. `RANGE_BITS = 30 < 31`, so the honest
//! window `[0, 2^30)` lies strictly below BabyBear's negative reps (a "negative"
//! `diff`, i.e. `R < L`, has field rep `p − (L−R) > 2^30`, no 30-bit decomposition):
//! the gadget BITES on an insolvent reserve. This is exactly the
//! `shielded/attest.rs` `Threshold`/`Positive` gadget (its `RANGE_BITS` non-vacuity
//! argument, verbatim), lowered here into the recursion-foldable IR-v2 grammar so no
//! new carrier is needed (the pre-req: a solvency leaf rides the 30-bit range gadget,
//! EVM-cheap / BabyBear-native).
//!
//! ## The claim tuple — `[reserve_commit, liability_commit]`, bound to the solvent R,L
//!
//! The two commitments are recomputed IN-AIR (two unconditional arity-7 `hash_fact`
//! chip sites over the PI-pinned commitment columns, the SAME fact-sponge carrier the
//! `note_spend_leaf_adapter` uses — KAT-pinned by `fact_arity7_chip_absorb_matches_hash_fact`)
//! and pinned to PI 0 / PI 1. Because `reserve_commit` opens to the SAME `R` the range
//! gadget compares (both read the row-0 `R` column) and likewise for `L`, the exposed
//! tuple certifies "there exist `R, L` with these commitments and `R ≥ L`". A forged
//! commitment that does not open to the compared value is UNSAT (the opening bites);
//! an insolvent `R < L` is UNSAT (the range bites). Neither discloses `R`, `L`, or the
//! salts — the privacy jewel (`DREGGFI-AMBITION` §B.2 #3, the shielded solvency face).
