//! # `dregg-node-target` — the shared federation-routing seam for the flagship fleet
//!
//! Every flagship (`spween-dregg`, `mud-dregg`, `attested-dm`, `commons-arbiter`,
//! `auditable-fund`, `confined-swarm`) mints its turns onto an **in-process** ledger:
//! its own [`dregg_app_framework::EmbeddedExecutor`], `agent_platform::LocalNode`, or
//! commitment-chain. That is real and verifiable, but it is *this process's* ledger —
//! nobody else sees it.
//!
//! [`NodeTarget`] is the one small config that makes the fleet **federation-capable**.
//! A crate holds a `NodeTarget` and, each time it lands a turn, offers that turn's
//! commitment to it:
//!
//! * [`NodeTarget::Local`] — the default. [`route`](NodeTarget::route) is a no-op; the
//!   crate keeps its own in-process ledger. Every existing test stays green + fast, no
//!   network.
//! * [`NodeTarget::Federation`] — the turn's commitment is **submitted to a real node**
//!   (`POST /turn/submit`) and then **confirmed landed** on that node's finalized log
//!   (`GET /api/receipts`). A node that rejects the submit, is unreachable, or does not
//!   show the turn as landed makes [`route`](NodeTarget::route) return [`Err`] — a
//!   forged / failed / non-landing submit is refused, fail-closed.
//!
//! This generalizes the `DREGG_NODE_URL` + Local-default pattern `agent-platform`
//! established (commit `b655a9357`) into a seam the whole fleet shares.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! The federation path is **fully wired and testable against a stub node**
//! ([`StubNode`], an in-memory federation node) with NO live server: submit → landed →
//! verified, and a rejecting / broken-link node is refused. The **real cross-node run**
//! — pointing `DREGG_NODE_URL` at ember's live hbox-persvati-nextop federation — is the
//! deploy step (the parallel lane standing that federation up), not the build. The real
//! HTTP transport ([`HttpNode`]) lives behind the `http` feature so the default build +
//! the green wiring tests never touch the network.
