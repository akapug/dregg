//! # dregg-narrator — a HOSTED narrator behind a HARD, self-enforced USD spend ceiling.
//!
//! The fiction engine wants a good hosted model to narrate, but a hosted model spends real
//! money per call. AWS Budgets are notification-only and lag hours — useless as a ceiling. So
//! this crate enforces the ceiling itself, at OUR invocation layer:
//!
//! * [`BudgetLedger`] — a persisted, concurrency-safe, fail-closed USD ledger. Every hosted call
//!   is a **pre-flight reservation** (refused BEFORE the network if it would exceed the cap) →
//!   the network call → a **post-flight true-up** with the response's real token usage, persisted
//!   atomically under an advisory file lock. A corrupt ledger refuses everything; a missing one
//!   starts at $0.00.
//! * [`ModelRegistry`] — the pinned price book. **The ledger refuses any model it has no price
//!   for** ([`NarratorError::UnpricedModel`]): you cannot cap a cost you do not know. Unverified
//!   rates are pinned as deliberate UPPER BOUNDS (see [`ledger::PriceSource`]).
//! * [`Narrator`] — three backends (Bedrock/Nova+Claude, local Ollama, deterministic Scripted)
//!   with honest fallback. [`Narrator::auto`] resolves Bedrock(Haiku) → Bedrock(Nova) → Ollama →
//!   Scripted, and every result reports the [`Narration::kind`] that ACTUALLY produced the text —
//!   never a model that did not narrate.
