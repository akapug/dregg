//! Tier-C PROOF gate — the whole-chain IVC range attestation (`.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md`
//! §10.2), the crate-side shape behind the `tier-c` feature.
//!
//! # The two halves of Tier C, and which one this is
//!
//! Tier C's spine is "no state row exists except as a verified-turn post-image".
//! It has TWO independent enforcement halves, and they live in different places:
//!
//! 1. **The per-row STRUCTURAL chain re-validation** — [`crate::mirror::
//!    verify_chain_step`], lifted into SQL as the `dregg_verify_turn` extern and
//!    the `dregg.commit_log` `BEFORE INSERT` trigger. It runs UNCONDITIONALLY (no
//!    feature), is circuit-free, and is the realizable per-row gate: a turn's
//!    `ordinal` is the next expected one AND its `prev_root` equals the head, so a
//!    tampered/reordered/forged batch is refused by the database engine. This is
//!    the load-bearing half that ships in every build.
//!
//! 2. **The whole-chain PROOF attestation** — THIS module. A `CommitRecord`
//!    carries no per-turn STARK (§10.2), so the per-row gate can NOT re-prove a
//!    turn's execution. The *proof* soundness is the whole-chain IVC light client
//!    (`circuit::ivc_turn_chain::verify_turn_chain_recursive`): ONE succinct
//!    recursive proof attesting that ALL K finalized turns in a receipt RANGE
//!    executed correctly and the root chain advanced from `genesis_root` to
//!    `final_root`. The verifier checks only the root; cost is independent of K.
//!    This is the orthogonal M3 item the doc names — surfaced here, behind
//!    `tier-c`, as a *range-attest* set-returning function (NOT a per-row STARK,
//!    which would be both impossible — no per-turn proof exists — and the wrong
//!    cost model).
//!
//! # Why a RANGE attestation, not a per-row one
//!
//! The IVC artifact is whole-chain by construction: a single recursive fold over
//! a *window* of finalized turns. Its natural SQL shape is therefore a function
//! that takes (the serialized proof, the trust-anchor VK, the claimed range
//! bounds) and, if the proof verifies against the anchor, RETURNS the attested
//! range as rows — `(ordinal, prev_root, ledger_root)` for each turn the range
//! covers, every row tagged `proof_attested = true`. A consumer JOINs that
//! against `dregg.turns` to learn "these ordinals are not merely chain-consistent
//! (the structural tooth) but PROOF-attested (every turn executed correctly,
//! verified in-circuit)". One proof attests a whole window; the SRF explodes the
//! window into rows so SQL can use it.
//!
//! # The proof boundary, and which build crosses it
//!
//! A whole `circuit::ivc_turn_chain::WholeChainProof` is NOT byte-encodable: its
//! `root.1` (`Rc<CircuitProverData>`) is prover-chaining data with no serde and no
//! verifier use. What crosses the SQL boundary as `bytea` is the VERIFY-SUFFICIENT
//! subset — the root `BatchStarkProof` (`root.0`, which derives `Serialize` with
//! `#[serde(bound = "")]`), the chain-binding `Proof` (likewise), and the four
//! public scalars — carried by the versioned [`SerializedWholeChainProof`] transport
//! (the SQL-side twin of `circuit::ivc_turn_chain::WholeChainProofBytes`). The
//! verifier never reads `root.1`, so byte-reconstruction of the verify path is total.
//!
//! Both builds DECODE this transport (fail-closed on malformed / wrong-version /
//! empty-component bytes — see [`SerializedWholeChainProof::from_bytes`]). They
//! differ only in whether the decoded parts are then cryptographically verified:
//!
//! * **`tier-c` OFF (default, circuit-free):** the circuit verifier is not linked,
//!   so [`verify_serialized_proof`] attests NOTHING after decode — the SAFE
//!   direction (refusal), never a false attest. The Tier-A/B + chain-gate build
//!   stays postgres-free and pulls no proof stack. This is the §10.3 discipline: a
//!   labeled proof gate that does not verify must say "unattested", never
//!   "attested" (a stub returning TRUE is the forbidden failure mode).
//!
//! * **`tier-c` ON:** the feature pulls `dregg-circuit` Lean-free (`--features
//!   recursion`: the plonky3 verify/recursion stack, NO executor, NO Lean runtime;
//!   §8.1 authorizes the circuit link for Tier C). [`verify_serialized_proof`] then
//!   postcard-decodes the two proof blobs INSIDE the circuit crate (which owns the
//!   p3 types) and runs the REAL three teeth via
//!   `circuit::ivc_turn_chain::verify_turn_chain_recursive_from_blobs`: the VK-pin
//!   against the caller's anchor, the carried-publics attestation against the
//!   binding proof's Fiat–Shamir-bound publics, and the root batch verify. A blob
//!   that does not decode, a foreign circuit, or a relabeled public is REFUSED
//!   (fail-closed) — never a false attest. On `Ok(())` the transport's window
//!   summary is returned as the attested publics.
//!
//! The signature of [`verify_serialized_proof`] is identical in both builds, so
//! [`attest_range`] is written ONCE against it and never branches on the feature.
//!
//! Everything outside the `tier-c` cryptographic check is plain Rust, postgres-free,
//! and `cargo test`-proven; the `tier-c` admit/refuse polarities are proven in
//! `tier_c_real_proof` (an ignored, real-fold test). The `#[pg_extern]` SRF in
//! [`crate`] marshals `bytea`/`bigint` into [`attest_range`].
//!
//! ## The remaining out-of-this-crate item (S2)
//!
//! S1 (the serializable transport) and S3 (the `tier-c` circuit link) are DONE
//! here. The one piece that lives elsewhere is **S2 — the node-side PRODUCER**:
//! when finality advances, fold the new finalized turns
//! (`circuit::ivc_turn_chain::prove_turn_chain_recursive` / the `fold_two_turns`
//! accumulator) and write the serialized proof + its window bounds into the
//! `dregg.turn_proofs(lo, hi, genesis_root, final_root, proof bytea, vk)` table the
//! SRF reads. That is a node/relayer job (`.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §10.2), not a gap in
//! this verifier.

//
//   `circuit::ivc_turn_chain::WholeChainProof` is
//       { root: RecursionOutput<SC>, binding_proof: RecursionCompatibleProof,
//         genesis_root: BabyBear, final_root: BabyBear,
//         chain_digest: BabyBear, num_turns: usize }
//   where `RecursionOutput<SC>(pub BatchStarkProof<SC>, pub Rc<CircuitProverData<SC>>)`.
//
// `BatchStarkProof` (`root.0`) and `RecursionCompatibleProof` (= a uni-STARK
// `Proof`, the `binding_proof`) BOTH derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`
// (`#[serde(bound = "")]`); the four publics are `BabyBear`/`usize`. The ONLY
// non-serde field is `root.1` — `Rc<CircuitProverData>`, the PROVER-CHAINING
// data. And the verifier never reads it: `verify_turn_chain_recursive` touches
// only `root.0`, `binding_proof`, and the four publics (the three teeth —
// `recursion_vk_fingerprint(&root.0)`, the binding-proof publics check, and
// `verify_recursive_batch_proof_with_config(&root.0, …)`). So the
// VERIFY-SUFFICIENT subset of a `WholeChainProof` is `{root.0, binding_proof,
// 4 publics}` — and every member of that subset IS serde.
//
// Therefore the transport carries exactly that subset, with the two proof
// components as opaque postcard blobs (so this crate's transport type needs NO
// circuit types — the default build stays circuit-free), plus the publics in the
// SQL-crossable byte form. The `tier-c` real leg decodes the two blobs into the
// concrete circuit types and verifies from the PARTS.
//

// `pg-dregg/src/`, named precisely): a `WholeChainProof` VALUE cannot be
// reconstructed from these bytes, because `root.1` (`Rc<CircuitProverData>`) is
// not serde and is prover-only. So the circuit must expose a parts verifier —
// `verify_turn_chain_recursive_from_parts(root_0: &BatchStarkProof, binding: &Proof,
// genesis/final/digest: BabyBear, num_turns)` — a ~6-line split of the existing
