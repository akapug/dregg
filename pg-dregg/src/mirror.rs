//! Tier B/C CORE — postgres-independent, `cargo test`-proven.
//!
//! This is the storage/query/verified-write substrate of `pg-dregg`, built to
//! the spine invariant of `.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §8:
//!
//! > **Reads are free SQL; state mutates ONLY through verified turns.**
//!
//! Like [`crate::authz`] (the Tier A core), everything here is plain Rust with
//! no `pgrx` dependency, so it is provable with `cargo test` (no postgres, no
//! `cargo-pgrx`). The `#[pg_extern]` wrappers in [`crate`] marshal SQL types
//! into these functions.
//!
//! ## Why this crate does NOT depend on `dregg-cell`
//!
//! `dregg-cell` pulls `dregg-circuit` unconditionally (its
//! `compute_canonical_state_commitment` is circuit-backed). Linking it here
//! would forfeit the circuit-free, offline property that makes the embeddable
//! `pg-dregg` layer attractive (`cargo tree -i dregg-circuit -p dregg-auth` is
//! empty, and we keep it that way). So the mirror works over **plain owned row
//! types** — the SQL-row projection of dregg state — and the *projection* from a
//! live `dregg_cell::Cell` into these rows happens on the **node** side (which
//! already has `dregg-cell`), at the commit-log sink. This crate owns the SQL
//! shape, the universal-memory model, the DDL, and the root-chaining tooth; the
//! node owns the `Cell -> CellRow` decode. The two meet at the serde wire
//! (`MirrorBatch`).
//!
//! ## What is in here
//!
//! 1. [`Domain`] + [`MemCell`] — the universal-memory model
//!    (`.docs-history-noclaude/UNIVERSAL-MEMORY.md`): ONE multiset over `Domain × κ`, the honest
//!    single-relation form of all dregg state.
//! 2. [`CellRow`] / [`TurnRow`] / [`CapRow`] — the typed projections of the
//!    commit log's `CommitRecord` + `Cell` + `CapabilityRef` (the query sugar
//!    over the universal table).
//! 3. [`MirrorBatch`] — one verified turn's worth of mirror rows, the serde unit
//!    the node ships into postgres (Tier B1, the mirror).
//! 4. [`RootChain`] — the Tier C tooth: the post-state root of turn *N* is the
//!    pre-state root of turn *N+1*; a batch that does not chain is refused. This
//!    is `snapshot.rs`'s `claimed_root` anti-substitution discipline, in SQL's
//!    write path.
//! 5. [`ddl`] — the schema as emittable SQL (so the extension ships its own
//!    `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE POLICY`, generated from the same Rust that defines
//!    the rows — no schema drift between code and DDL).

// subscriber tails a publisher's `dregg.turns`/`cells`/`capabilities`/`memory`
// (CREATE PUBLICATION / CREATE SUBSCRIPTION). The load-bearing soundness claim is
// that the anti-substitution tooth SURVIVES replication: it is STRUCTURAL ON THE
// `turns` ROWS (turn N's `ledger_root` == turn N+1's `prev_root`, ordinals dense),
// and logical replication copies those rows verbatim — so a subscriber can re-run
// the SAME `verify_chain_step` over its replicated rows and get the identical
// accept/refuse verdict the publisher did. A subscriber re-validates; it does not
// trust the stream. A reordered / substituted / dropped turn in the replication
// stream is caught by the tooth ON THE SUBSCRIBER SIDE.
//
// This is the realizable, circuit-free half every replica enforces (the Tier-C
// proof verify is the expensive complete half a *verifying* replica adds on top —
// see `crate::attest`). The function below is what a subscriber-side apply hook /

// 4c. Federation: the pg18 conflict counters DRIVE re-validation (compose).
// ============================================================================
//
// .docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md §15 + .docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG-PG18.md §10. The `dregg.replication_conflicts`
// view sums pg18's seven per-subscription `confl_*` counters into a
// `conflicts_total` alarm. The dregg federation model is SINGLE-WRITER FAN-OUT:
// the publisher is the only writer, subscribers RE-VALIDATE the replicated turn
// chain rather than accept local writes — so an apply conflict (a row the
// subscriber already holds, a missing update/delete target, a divergent origin)
// is, BY CONSTRUCTION, an ANOMALY: it means the stream is not the clean
// verified-turn feed the model assumes.
//
// The two halves SIT ON DIFFERENT LAYERS, and pg detects each:
//   * the CHAIN TOOTH (`revalidate_replicated_chain`) catches a substituted ROOT
//     (turn N's `ledger_root` ≠ turn N+1's `prev_root`) — a *structural* divergence
//     on the replicated `turns` rows;
//   * the CONFLICT COUNTERS catch an *apply-level* divergence pg itself detected
//     while applying the stream (before the rows even reach a shape the tooth reads).
//
// They COMPOSE: a non-zero `conflicts_total` is the signal that pg saw the feed
// diverge at apply time, and that is exactly when a subscriber should NOT trust
// its `dregg.turns` and MUST re-run the anti-substitution tooth over them. So the
// conflict alarm is not just a number to watch — it is the TRIGGER for the chain
// re-validation. This module is the pure, `cargo test`-provable half of that
// composition: the conflict report, the alarm/trigger decision, and the combined
// verdict. `lib.rs`'s `dregg_federation_health()` extern reads the REAL pg18
// `dregg.replication_conflicts` counters into a [`ConflictReport`], and — when the
// alarm fires — reads `dregg.turns` and runs [`revalidate_replicated_chain`],
// returning the [`FederationHealth`] this module composes.
