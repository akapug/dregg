//! THE FLAGSHIP DEMO — a horizontally-integrated, multi-party, crash-surviving
//! verified durable workflow, expressed on the **reusable** pg-dregg
//! durable-workflow API ([`pg_dregg::workflow`]).
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example supply_chain
//! ```
//!
//! ## The pitch: "DBOS, but every state mutation is a verified turn"
//!
//! DBOS gives you *durable execution* on postgres: a workflow checkpoints its
//! steps to postgres and, after a crash, replays from the durable log so it runs
//! exactly once. That is real and valuable — but the steps themselves are
//! ordinary code that issues ordinary `UPDATE`s. DBOS trusts the writer.
//!
//! pg-dregg gives you durable execution where **state mutates ONLY through a
//! verified, capability-secure, conservation-respecting turn** (the spine
//! invariant, `.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §8):
//!
//!   * **reads are free SQL** — any `SELECT`/join/aggregate over the mirror is
//!     sound by construction (a read cannot break a transition-function invariant);
//!   * **writes are gated** — a state row exists ONLY as the post-image of a
//!     verified turn submitted through the ONE door (`dregg.commit_log`), whose
//!     trigger runs the real anti-substitution chain tooth (`RootChain`);
//!   * **capabilities attenuate** — each agent holds a strictly-narrowed token
//!     (`granted ⊆ held`, provably; no agent can act outside its grant);
//!   * **value is conserved** — the per-turn balance deltas sum to zero;
//!   * **federation is self-checking** — a replicated mirror re-validates the
//!     chain locally and an apply-conflict alarm DRIVES that re-validation.
//!
//! So pg-dregg is not just durable. It is durable **+ unforgeable + attenuable +
//! conserving + federated**. A DBOS workflow that fat-fingers
//! `UPDATE balances SET amount = amount + 1000000` succeeds and forges value;
//! the identical mutation through pg-dregg is refused by the database engine
//! because it carries no verified turn, no chaining root, no conserved delta.
//!
//! ## On the API (this is the proof the API is sufficient)
//!
//! Earlier this demo HAND-CODED its own durable engine. It no longer does: the
//! whole orchestration — `submit` through the three-gate spine, the durable log,
//! crash recovery, exactly-once resume — is the shipped, reusable
//! [`pg_dregg::workflow`] API ([`Workflow`] / [`Step`] / [`WorkflowEngine`] /
//! `run` / `resume`). The four-party purchase order below is expressed *on that
//! API*, which is exactly the evidence that the API is enough to build a real
//! "DBOS but verified" workflow. The only bespoke code left here is the
//! narration, the per-agent capability minting, and the adversarial probes
//! (the forged-write attempt + the federation re-validation), which reach under
//! the API on purpose to show the gates the API rests on.
//!
//! ## The scenario — a four-party agentic supply chain
//!
//! A purchase order is fulfilled by four parties, each an autonomous agent
//! holding its OWN attenuated capability:
//!
//!   * **TREASURY** — the settlement bank (funds the buyer; the genesis mint).
//!   * **BUYER**     — places the order and pays the supplier on delivery.
//!   * **SUPPLIER**  — accepts the order, ships goods, gets paid.
//!   * **SHIPPER**   — is paid a delivery fee out of the buyer's escrow.
//!
//! The workflow is a multi-step verified-durable orchestration:
//!
//!   step 0  genesis        TREASURY funded to 1_000_000
//!   step 1  fund buyer      TREASURY → BUYER 10_000           (settlement)
//!   step 2  place order     BUYER escrows 6_000 to an ORDER cell (PO opened)
//!   step 3  accept order    SUPPLIER grants BUYER a delivery capability (cap edge)
//!   --------  ✸ SIMULATED CRASH between step 3 and step 4  ✸  --------
//!   step 4  ship + pay      ORDER → SUPPLIER 5_000, ORDER → SHIPPER 1_000  (escrow released)
//!   step 5  close order     BUYER closes the PO (nonce bump, organ-style op)
//!
//! Every step is a *receipted turn* (provable who-did-what: the turn's `creator`
//! is the acting agent). The crash is real: we drop the in-memory engine after
//! step 3 and rebuild it from the durable log via [`WorkflowEngine::recover`],
//! then [`WorkflowEngine::resume`] the chain — exactly-once, nothing lost,
//! nothing double-applied.
//!
//! ## What this drives (NOT a reimplementation)
//!
//! The [`pg_dregg::workflow`] API calls the REAL pg-dregg cores that `cargo test`
//! proves and the `#[pg_test]`s exercise through live pg18 SQL:
//!
//!   * [`pg_dregg::authz`]       — the verified capability decision + attenuation
//!                                 + the `submit`-gate admission (the RLS check);
//!   * [`pg_dregg::mirror`]      — `MirrorBatch` (the verified-turn wire unit),
//!                                 `RootChain` (the chain-gate / spine tooth),
//!                                 `federation_health` (the conflict-driven sweep);
//!
//! The only thing synthesized is the *node's commit-log projection* (the
//! `dregg_cell::Cell → CellRow` decode that lives node-side, queued behind the
//! rotation lane), which the API isolates behind its [`Projector`] seam — here
//! the default deterministic fold, in production the kernel's `ledger_root`. The
//! chain tooth, the authz decision, the conservation, the durability are all the
//! shipped cores, unchanged.
