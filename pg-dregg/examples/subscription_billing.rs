//! THE REVOCATION FLAGSHIP — a recurring subscription-billing settlement whose
//! every charge is a VERIFIED, capability-gated turn, and where **cancelling a
//! subscription INSTANTLY refuses the next charge** because cancellation is a
//! capability revocation the spine consults on the very next turn.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example subscription_billing
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this demo exists (and how it differs from `supply_chain`)
//!
//! `examples/supply_chain` is the four-party purchase-order flagship: it shows
//! crash-recovery, conservation, the forged-write refusal, and federation. This
//! demo is the **instant-revocation** flagship — the headline pg-dregg property
//! `supply_chain` does NOT exercise:
//!
//!   * a recurring charge runs as a verified turn (`PROCESSOR` debits the
//!     subscriber, credits the merchant — Σδ = 0, value conserved);
//!   * the subscriber's "active subscription" IS a dregg capability;
//!   * **`dregg_revoke(token)` — the subscriber hits "cancel" — and the VERY
//!     NEXT billing turn for that subscriber is REFUSED** by the AUTHZ gate, with
//!     no polling, no TTL, no bounded staleness (`.docs-history-noclaude/PG-DREGG.md` §3; ember
//!     decision #1 — revocation is instant). The merchant cannot bill a
//!     cancelled subscriber even by replaying last month's signed turn;
//!   * **re-subscription (`dregg_unrevoke`) restores billing on the next turn** —
//!     the capability never changed, only the revocation registry did;
//!   * then a **crash mid-billing-run** + recovery re-validates the whole charge
//!     history and resumes exactly-once (so a crash never double-charges and
//!     never silently drops a charge).
//!
//! ## The pitch: "Stripe Billing's durability — but a cancelled card CANNOT be charged, provably"
//!
//! A conventional billing system (DBOS-style durable or not) enforces "is this
//! subscription active?" in *application code* that issues an ordinary `UPDATE`.
//! A bug, a stale cache, a replayed job, or an SQL-injection in that code can
//! charge a cancelled customer — the authorization is advisory. Here the
//! authorization is the **capability the charge turn must present**: revoke it
//! and the database engine's verified-write spine refuses the charge on the next
//! turn. "Was this charge authorized?" is not a code path you can get wrong; it
//! is a verified gate the turn cannot pass without a live capability.
//!
//! ## What this drives (NOT a reimplementation)
//!
//! The whole orchestration is the shipped, reusable [`pg_dregg::workflow`] API
//! (`Workflow` / `Step` / `WorkflowEngine` / `run_durable` / `recover_from_durable`
//! / `resume_durable`), over the REAL pg-dregg cores `cargo test` proves and the
//! `#[pg_test]`s exercise through live pg18 SQL:
//!
//!   * [`pg_dregg::authz`]  — the verified capability decision, attenuation, AND
//!                            the instant-revocation registry ([`authz::revoke`] /
//!                            [`authz::unrevoke`], consulted on EVERY `decide`);
//!   * [`pg_dregg::mirror`] — `MirrorBatch` (the verified-turn unit), `RootChain`
//!                            (the anti-substitution chain tooth).
//!
//! The only synthesized piece is the node-side commit-log projection (the
//! [`Projector`] seam — here the default deterministic fold, in production the
//! kernel's `ledger_root`). The authz decision, the revocation, the conservation,
//! the durability, the chain tooth are all the shipped cores, unchanged.
